After drawing the cheese and the mouse, tired from a hard day\'s work, Tom retires to his bed where he dreams of potential success, fame, and fortune. While Tom sleeps, the stick figure mouse suddenly comes to life, abseils down the drawing board, and enters Jerry\'s mousehole to warn him about Tom\'s plan. Never having seen such a thing before, Jerry is skeptical and refuses to follow the stick mouse. When he is woken up again, stick mouse makes the decision for him, dragging Jerry to the drawing board and blueprint. Just then, the stick figure cat on the blueprint also comes to life; when the two mice pass by the cat, it reveals itself to them. Promptly, Jerry hands stick-mouse an eraser, who erases the cat\'s teeth; it grabs a brush and draws a bigger set of teeth on itself before beginning the chase. Stick-mouse draws a mousehole in empty space on the blueprint, which Jerry safely enters; however, the stick mouse is pursued by the stick cat and is caught. Jerry walks behind the cat, draws shorter hind legs on it, and erases its bigger legs, causing stick-cat to fall down. It looks down at its feet while chasing Jerry and discovers its modification, and in return, uses its tail as a lasso to retrieve Jerry. Meanwhile, stick-mouse draws a bow and arrow and fires it at the cat, who pulls the arrow out of its rear and promptly deflates its own torso. Stick-mouse runs away and camouflages itself as one of the flowers in a flowerpot on the blueprint; the cat suspects nothing, and while turned the other way, the stick-mouse ladles the cat with a fork as one would spaghetti, then runs away as it unravels itself. Both mice jump off the drawing board, with stick-mouse acting as a parachute, while stick-cat jumps down and bounces akin to a pogo stick until it comes face-to-face with a jet of water fired by stick-mouse. The cat disintegrates into white ink, and before anything more than its head can reform, Jerry sucks the cat into an ink pen and empties it into Tom\'s jar of white ink. The two mice shake hands, but soon hear Tom yawning, about to wake up; quickly, they alter a key measurement on the blueprint, and both mice narrowly return to their original positions before Tom sees them.

After his trap is completed, Tom hides in anticipation as Jerry emerges from his mousehole and grabs a piece of cheese which Tom has tied to his creation. This sets off a complicated chain of events which eventually lead the release of a safe which is to flatten the mouse. Tom emerges from his hiding place and prepares Jerry for his demise by giving him one last cigarette, but the altered measurement causes the safe to land two feet closer to the mousehole - onto Tom instead of Jerry. The safe door opens, and Tom emerges, now cube-shaped like the safe\'s interior. Not knowing the real cause behind the trap\'s malfunction, he curses  over his failure and leans on the safe.'] ['Stork is a 6 foot 7 hypochondriac who dreams of revolution and works at General Motors Holden.

The people of London prospered and were very happy. However, the good king fell ill, and his captain of the guard, Pete plundered and terrorized all of England, and worst of all, he did it in the name of the king. Until one day... Mickey, Goofy and Pluto, are three beggars trying to get money for some food. Mickey and Pluto try selling firewood for the winter, while Goofy sells flavored snow, but they are all unsuccessful. After singing a song expressing their dreams of "living like a king", Captain Pete\'s carriage passes, having stolen much food from the people of London, and burying the three heroes in the snow. The hungry Pluto sees a sausage stand out from the carriage and begins to chase, pursuing it into the castle of the king. Mickey knocks on the door to get his dog back, and one of the soldiers opens the door and lets him in, mistaking him for the prince. Pete scolds the soldier for letting anyone in, pointing out where the real prince is: taking his classes with his boring teacher, Horace Horsecollar. The teacher teaches the prince about trigonometry, while the latter looks out the window at the children playing in the snow. The prince, being discovered by his teacher, is mocked by his valet, Donald. The prince plays at provoking Donald, while the teacher is distracted while writing on the blackboard, to the point that Donald hits, unwittingly, the teacher, resulting in the teacher sending Donald out of the room, returning both to their boring studies. But the Prince soon hears a commotion outside: it is Captain Pete, who is roughly handling Mickey and Pluto. The prince orders them to be brought to him right away. Pete kicks Mickey through the door, and kicks Pluto out of the castle. Mickey, astonished to be in the king\'s palace, inadvertently knocks over many suits of armor, with one of the helmets falling on both his and the approaching Prince\'s heads. The two Mickeys are surprised to see that they are entirely alike in appearance. The prince tells the beggar that he is bored with his life: getting up early, studying all day, with every night parties and banquets and then go to bed early. So, when looking at the two in the mirror and realize that they can exchange a costume and take the role of the other, the prince reassures the beggar saying that to rule that requires only two things: "What a splendid idea, good thing I thought of it!" and "Guards, seize him!", and if there are any problems, everyone will recognize the true prince with his real ring. The prince, disguised as a beggar, down the window, fooling the Captain Pete, who believes he is the beggar. Pete throws the "beggar" out with a catapult.

Meanwhile, Mickey is challenged with the prince\'s studies, such as chemistry, where the formula explodes in Donald\'s face, and falconry, where he is chased by the falcon.

After getting away, the prince sees a couple of soldiers trying to steal a chicken from Clarabelle Cow and her two children, saying it is for the king. But the prince in disguise orders them to return the chicken. The soldiers throw a pumpkin over him for a crown and leave, not believing he is the true prince. Children help him get up and explain that for years the soldiers take away their food and belongings in the name of the king. But a carriage, which carries food stolen from the village, goes by, and the prince stops it, showing the real ring. All bow to the Prince as he returns their food. But the soldiers, who had been called by the man driving the carriage, try to stop the prince, accusing him of fraud. The prince escapes with a little help from the other commoners, especially Goofy. Meanwhile in the castle, one of the soldiers tells Pete that one of the beggars had the royal ring. Pete is alarmed knowing then that the prince was cast out, and may see the corruption and theft going on outside. The soldier mocks Pete saying that he  is going to be punished dearly for it, but Pete answers that he won\'t if the prince never returns. The beggar, dressed as the prince, is called by Horace Horsecollar and told that he must see his "father", who is now dying. Mickey enters the room of the dying king, but does not have the heart to tell him that he is not the real prince. Instead, as the sick king tells him he must take his royal birthright and become king, he sadly promises. Shortly afterwards, the king dies. Mickey knows the true prince must be found as quickly as possible, but Captain Pete arrives behind him, and threatens Mickey to be crowned king at his orders, revealing that he had captured Mickey\'s dog Pluto as a hostage. Meanwhile, the true prince hears the bells announcing the death of his beloved father. Knowing that he should be king, the Prince decides to return immediately to the palace. But Pete appears and manages to capture him and puts him into the jail along with Donald, while the coronation begins. The beggar does not want to be king, but behind the curtain Pete is strangling Pluto. The prince orders the guard to let them leave, but he refuses to obey. A dark figure walks up the stairs: a hooded man armed with an axe. The guard believes the man is the executioner, but the man trips and accidentally knocks out the guard. Then he removes the hood: it is Goofy. Goofy tries to figure out which key opens the cell while the other soldiers arrive. In a panic, Donald finds the key for the cell, and the three flee to the coronation chamber. The beggar, struggling not to be crowned, finally stops the archbishop, and orders the guards to arrest Pete. But Pete defends himself by pointing to the beggar as an impostor. The Prince arrives in time before they kill the beggar and makes his entrance. The Prince and Captain Pete duel as many other soldiers are defeated by Goofy\'s clumsiness and Donald\'s cowardice. Finally, the Prince cuts Captain Pete\'s trousers loose, causing them to fall down and reveal Pete\'s underpants: a frilly, lacy pair of white panties with red heart prints. Pete tries to hold his trousers up during his attempt to escape from a large chandelier that has fallen and entangled some soldiers, but is tripped up by Mickey and the Prince, causing him to fall down. With his trousers down and his ruffled panties fully displayed, Captain Pete becomes entangled with the soldiers in the fallen chandelier that ends up rolling out of a large glass window and dropping down out onto the streets below to death. Mickey and the Prince then cheer because of their successful collaboration in defeating Captain Pete. The archbishop is confused and does not know who to crown, until Pluto recognizes the beggar, and the Prince shows his ring. The Prince is crowned King of England, and with Mickey and Goofy at his side, rules for many years with justice and compassion for all.'] ['The short opens on a small, white-shirted, worried group of mice wearing sombreros thinking of how to get cheese from the AJAX cheese factory across the Mexican-American border that is guarded by Sylvester the Cat.

They then started to fry an egg using the camp fire and other limited equipment that they have. While Oswald and the bear couldn't agree on how they should have the fried egg, a squirrel pops out from the tree and snatches it from them.

The lander carries two astronauts, one of them a black male model, James Washington, specifically chosen to aid the President of the United States in her re-election . Upon landing on the Far side of the Moon they encounter the Nazis who have hidden there since 1945. Washington is taken captive and the other astronaut killed. Nazi scientist Doktor Richter investigates Washington and finds his smartphone. Although initially skeptical, he recognizes that its computing power outstrips all their technology combined. Moreover it serves perfectly as a control unit for space battleship Götterdämmerung. When he strives to demonstrate the completion of his Wunderwaffe to the current Führer, Wolfgang Kortzfleisch, the phone runs out of power. Nazi commander Klaus Adler, who is  chosen to mate with Earth specialist Renate Richter, Doktor Richter\'s daughter, offers to go to Earth to collect more phones. Adler takes a spacecraft to Earth, taking James with him, who has been bleached by Richter. Upon landing they find that Renate has stowed away and travelled with them. Meanwhile on Earth, the President of the United States has to tackle political issues; she desperately needs a miracle to ensure her re-election. Her aide, Vivian Wagner , introduces the Nazi couple to her. Adler and Richter go on to revamp the President\'s campaign Nazi-style, with apparent success, while the clueless Richter is unaware of Adler\'s ambition to become the next Führer and rule the world. After three months, Kortzfleisch seems to have figured out Adler\'s plan. He sends his armada  to Earth orbit. He himself lands on Earth and confronts Adler, but is consequently killed by him and Vivian. Adler declares himself the new Führer before he returns to orbit with Kortzfleisch\'s flying saucer. At the same time, Renate Richter comes across the now homeless Washington who makes her realise that terrestrial Nazis are not to her liking. The United Nations assemble to discuss the extra-terrestrial Nazi threat. The President is excited to finally have a war which will likely get her re-elected, and appoints Vivian Wagner as commander of the spacecraft USS George W. Bush, which orbits the Earth carrying nuclear weapons. As it turns out, most of the other nations have also developed armed spacecraft, and join in to defeat the invading Nazi armada. Back on Earth, Richter convinces Washington to come with her back to the Moon to stop Adler. They take Adler\'s flying saucer back to the Moon and to the Götterdämmerung, where Washington attempts to disable the engines while Renate goes looking for Adler. Meanwhile, the international spacecraft armada has destroyed the Swastika moonbase and is heading for the Götterdämmerung as well. In the final battle, Washington manages to disconnect the tablet device now controlling the Götterdämmerung while Richter takes out Adler. The spaceship crashes into the Moon, but not before Adler has taken out a considerable chunk of the Moon attempting to get a clear shot at the Earth. The U.S. President calls Wagner from the UN session, congratulating her on her victory. Wagner discloses she detected large tanks of Helium-3 on the Moon. This material would keep the United States independent of foreign power sources for a millennium. Consequently the U.S. president immediately lays claim to it. This enrages a white-haired UN member  who throws his shoe at her. All UN members join the following "meeting hall battle". This leads to an international turmoil and eventually even the international spacecraft of the hitherto allied nations start attacking each other. Richter meets up with Washington  in the damaged Swastika moonbase, where they embrace in front of Richter\'s flabbergasted former students and some adults who have fled there from other parts of the base. Richter states that "[they] have a lotta work cut out for [them]". The final moments of the film show the Earth, where missiles are causing nuclear explosions across the globe. At the very end of the credits, the planet Mars is revealed with a man-made satellite of undetermined origin in orbit.'] ['The story centers around the relationship of the three main characters.

Mari\'s father won\'t allow her to marry until Söfren obtains a full-time church assignment. Söfren learns that he is competing with two other men who are affluent scholars from Copenhagen. The three men wait outside the church until the verger calls them in, one by one, to deliver their trial sermons. The first candidate delivers a sermon on the creation story that promptly puts the entire congregation to sleep. The second candidate is summoned and announces that his sermon topic is "Balaam\'s ass and God\'s strange power by which He was able to open the jaws of a dumb animal so that it might speak like a man!" \' The verger comes out to summon Söfren and finds him doing handstands. Söfren bounds into the church, surveys the congregation and begins: "Now, two learned applicants have appeared here before me. One of them took us to Eden, and that is as far back as we can go. Let him stay there! The other one chose the text: Am I Not An Ass? But what has an ass to do on the pulpit? My friends, I will not take you to Eden -- you are too clever. But I will take you to the bowels of the earth, deep in the roaring jaws of Hell!" The congregation is enthralled by Söfren\'s "fire and brimstone" sermon. Söfren concludes: "And so my friends, beware that you are not swallowed up by the roaring jaws of Hell!" Söfren\'s rivals from Copenhagen host a dinner for the townspeople and feel obliged to invite Söfren. The church committee announces that Söfren is their choice for pastor. The committee spokesman then adds that Margarete Pedersdotter, the widow of the previous pastor, has exercised her right to demand that her husband\'s successor marry her. Dame Margarete, who is at least a half-century older than Söfren, enters the room. The two pastoral candidates from Copenhagen bolt from the room, hastily climb on their horses and gallop away. Margarete doesn\'t take a seat near Söfren but chooses to sit next to the fireplace. Gradually the townspeople also leave the dining hall. After a lengthy period of silence, Margarete approaches Söfren and asks, in that it has grown dark outside, if he would walk with her to the parsonage. When they reach the parsonage, Margarete invites Söfren inside. As Söfren takes note of the fine furnishings, Magarete lays out another repast, which Söfren devours greedily despite having just come from the town dinner. While he is eating, Margarete asks Söfren if he has a fiancee. Söfren hesitates, then assures her that he does not. Margarete mentions that it is much too late for Söfren to head back to the inn and suggests he stay in an upstairs room. The next morning Söfren puts on a fine suit of clothes, far superior to his own garments, that was laid out by his bed during the night. Söfren goes downstairs. Margarete is sewing and the table has been set with a fine breakfast of herring, bread and butter, and a canister of schnapps. After Söfren finishes the schnapps, Margarete takes on the appearance of a smiling 20-year-old. Margarete asks if he would like to marry her; Söfren replies in the affirmative. Margarete calls in her two servants from the next room as witnesses of Söfren\'s proposal. Margarete assures Söfren they will have separate sleeping quarters and maintain separate lives. Söfren leaves to tell Mari what has happened, and Margarete follows at a distance. A tearful Mari asks Söfren how Margarete bewitched him and Söfren suggests she had hexed the herring. Margarete arrives and confronts Söfren -- who is this woman? Söfren replies that Mari is his sister and asks that she be allowed to stay in the parsonage, to which Margarete assents. Söfren and Margarete are married. The next morning, Söfren is upset when Margarete\'s female servant shakes debris from a rug on him from a balcony. Margarete\'s male servant gives Söfren a raspberry when asked to stop whistling. Söfren confronts Margarete: "In the future, I suggest you and your companions be less high and mighty. For I am master of this house." Margarete goes to a window and taps on it to summon the bearish male servant. She instructs him: "Master Söfren is too big for his boots. Give him a drubbing!" Afterward, Margarete advises her husband: "I suggest you concentrate on prayer and sermons. Do not play master here. I am master of this house!" Söfren makes several unsuccessful attempts to have time alone with Mari. One day he notices Margarete climb the ladder to the loft of the barn. Söfren removes the ladder, hoping to trap Margarete in the loft, and goes in search of Mari. Mari, however, is also in the loft, and she starts to climb down without noticing that the ladder has been moved. Mari falls to the ground and Söfren rushes over and calls up a warning to Margarete: "Be careful, Dame Margarete! The ladder is gone!" Söfren carried Mari into the house and learns that she has broken a thigh bone and suffered a concussion but will recover. Margarete takes on the role of Mari\'s nurse and, in return, Söfren begins to grow fond of Margarete. One day, as Margarete and Söfren sit by Mari\'s bedside, Margarete confesses: "My first husband and I were engaged for many years when he applied for the post here and learned he could have it only if he wedded the parson\'s widow. We knew that the widow was weak and could scarcely live long. It was a sore temptation to us. God forgive us ... we built our happiness on the hope of another\'s death." That prompted Söfren to confess: "Mari and I are not sister and brother -- she is my fiancee. We have also waited for your death, Dame Margarete." Margarete appears to have initially been taken aback, then her face softens and she murmurs "Poor children!" From that moment, Söfren and Mari have no trouble spending time together and Margarete spends most of her time in the churchyard, visiting her husband\'s grave. One morning Margarete does not come down to breakfast. Söfren and Mari go to her bedroom, where they find her in a peaceful repose after dying in her sleep. Söfren finds a note beside the bed: "Do not forget, when my mortal remains are taken away, to put a horseshoe over the door and to strew linseed after me so that I shall not haunt you." Margarete is buried beside her husband. As Söfren and Mari stand over her grave, Söfren remarks: "We owe her a great debt, Mari. She taught you to keep a good home and she taught me to be an honorable man."'] ['Lasting just 61 seconds and consisting of two shots, the first shot is set in a wood during winter.

Burton reports to General Partridge, who is overseeing the Bradley. Portrayed as an innocent, Burton quickly becomes disillusioned by the "real" way the development process works, in an atmosphere of corruption and/or bureaucratic inefficiency. Burton witnesses generals, including Partridge, reviewing other inefficient  projects with Secretary of Defence Caspar Weinberger - such as the M247 Sergeant York and the A-12 Avenger II.  Insisting on getting fully up to speed on the Bradley, Burton delves into the mountains of paper documenting the Bradley\'s development history: Originally developed as an armored personnel carrier by Colonel Robert L. Smith , the Bradley, after being subjected to the changing  demands of a panel of armchair generals, is transformed into a hybrid of a troop carrier, a scout vehicle, and an anti-tank weapon platform. To make room for the weaponry, its complement of troops is reduced from eleven to six men; and despite its firepower, it has to be made of lightweight aluminum to serve as a scout vehicle. In the incredulous summation of Burton and his assistant, Sgt. Fanning , the finished Bradley is "a troop transport that can\'t carry troops, a reconnaissance vehicle that\'s too conspicuous to do reconnaissance, and a quasi-tank that has less armor than a snowblower, but carries enough ammo to take out half of D.C." By the time General Partridge is put in charge of the project, the Bradley has been in development for seventeen years, at a cost of $14 billion.  In attempting to meet the demands of his superiors, Smith has labored for eleven years without promotion or advancement; when the Bradley is finally approved, he gets his long-awaited promotion to Brigadier General. Smith is a living example of how difficult, if not impossible, it is to develop weapons in an above-board manner; now, as he acerbically explains to Colonel Burton, since completing weapons is the only path to promotion, or lucrative positions in the private sector, the majority of the Pentagon\'s officials prefer to fake test results, and pass defective weapons and equipment on to the troops in the field. Burton is disbelieving, until he insists on testing whether the Bradley can stand up to fire under combat conditions. Partridge and his two cronies, Colonel Bach  and Major Sayers ([[Tom Wright , manipulate every test result - for example, by filling the fuel tanks with water instead of gasoline, filling the ammunition with sand instead of propellant, and confiscating a cartload of sheep killed by toxic fumes inside the vehicle when its hull combusts. Burton confronts Sergeant Dalton , in charge of the testing range, who admits being ordered to manipulate the test results, but bitterly tells Colonel Burton that every officer who tries to conduct honest tests eventually buckles under the pressure to gain his next promotion. But Burton refuses to approve the Bradley without a live-fire test, insisting that the current version of the vehicle is a death trap. Eventually, Partridge pulls strings to get Burton fired. But Smith leaks the information to the press, and the resulting scandal leads to the current hearings. Despite Partridge\'s denials, the House Committee approves Burton\'s request for a live-fire test. The night before the test, Burton visits the barracks on the range, and tells Dalton and his men that, regardless of whatever orders they have received from Partridge or his cronies, it is their duty to their fellow soldiers to make sure the test is performed honestly, driving home his point with an anecdote about the horrific casualties caused by defective M-16 rifles issued to American soldiers during the early years of the Vietnam War. On the day of the test, which Partridge, Bach, and Sayers fully expect to confirm their side of the story, Dalton and his men have actually made sure the Bradley is in fighting condition. When hit by a Soviet anti-tank round, the vehicle explodes spectacularly. Dalton and his men confide to Burton that they had already put the Bradley in the right state before he gave them the speech. In a postscript, it is explained that the Bradley was extensively redesigned in response to Burton\'s demands, which significantly reduced casualties from its use during the Persian Gulf War. However, the system was too strong: Partridge and his cronies earned their promotions and lucrative private sector jobs, while Colonel Burton was forced to retire.'] ["Veysel loves a singer named Başak.

The warehouse is known to be owned by Cappuccino. As the police investigate, Vegan, a lieutenant of Cappuccino arrives at the warehouse. After discovering the massacre, Vegan, who runs guns for Cappuccino, quickly informs his boss what has happened and that Cappuccino is Killer Bean\'s next target. Due to Killer Bean\'s skill, Vegan suggests hiring mercenary soldiers to kill him. Killer Bean receives an encrypted call from his boss warning him that he is being reckless and that the attack on the warehouse should have never happened, and that only the "target" should be killed. Killer Bean ensures his boss that the mission will succeed. Killer Bean goes to another of Cappuccino\'s warehouses but instead finds Vegan there, who attempts to kill him. The fight between Vegan and Killer Bean ends as a draw. Vegan leaves a note to Killer Bean which reads, "Shadow Bean, you are too late".

Dark Bean claims to have left the Shadow Agency and run guns for Cappuccino so that he could be knowledgeable of all weapon transfers, and thus could fight crime. Killer Bean doesn\'t believe him, and kills Dark Bean as he attempts to shoot Killer Bean first. Detective Cromwell witnesses the entire fight, and orders the entire police department to capture Killer Bean.

Merida escapes along with her mother Queen Elinor while Fergus fights off the bear at the cost of his left leg. Years later, Merida has become a free-spirited teenager and an older sister of identical triplets: Hamish, Hubert and Harris.

Merida theorizes that she can reverse the spell by repairing her family tapestry. At the castle, the clans are on the verge of war, but the princess quells their fighting. With the encouragement of her mother who uses charades to guide Merida through a speech, the princess declares that the children should be allowed to get married in their own time.

He is met by two physical manifestations of his personality — the classic "good angel on one shoulder, bad devil on the other shoulder" dilemma common to cartoons of the time — identified as the "thrifty saver" and the "spendthrift." The "good duck" appears as a slightly elderly duck with a Scottish accent who wears a kilt and Scottish cap and urges Donald to be thrifty with his money so he can be sure to pay his taxes for the war effort. The "bad duck" appears as a zoot suit-wearing hipster who urges Donald to spend his duly earned money on idle pleasures such as "good dates". The good angel reminds of other "dates" - the dates when his taxes are due.  The narrator explains that Americans should "gladly and proudly" pay their income taxes which are higher that year "thanks to Hitler and Hirohito."  A tug-of-war ensues between "spend" and "save" with Donald caught in the middle. Eventually the two sides give way and crash on opposite ends of Donald to reveal the "true" selves: the doors of the bad duck\'s club are revealed to be swastikas and the bad duck himself turns out to bear a resemblance to Hitler , while the wall the good duck has crashed up against resembles the flag of the United States. The narrator then asks the audience if they are going to "spend for the Axis" or "save for taxes". Having made the seemingly obvious choice, Donald is assumed to shake hands with the bad duck, but it is revealed that he heads over to the bad duck to punch him out at the last second. He then goes to proudly pay his taxes with the good duck. The second part of the film is a montage showing how the taxes are being used to make planes, bombs, ships, and other war materials.

She doesn\'t connect with Doug, but she does get him to come out of his shell by the end of the date. She takes Bobby to several places that put him completely out of his element and then he takes her to a baseball card show where she discovers a different side of him.

Perceiving this task as the first step in his financial career, Vova Smorodin develops the magic-touch of enterprise. If he needs to drain and repair the selected basement, he may recall an entire fire brigade from a fire emergency, or a company of soldiers from a mission. After taking over an empty attic for his office, Vova discovers there three Bohemian artists who have escaped from a mental hospital: the suicidal model Dasha , the alcoholic artist Gena  and the mute Buddhist known by the nickname Khu-Pun\' . This meeting becomes a turning point in Vova\'s previously confident life. Having realized that the homeless artists could paint appetizing food on the walls of his basement restaurant in exchange for room and board, he allows them to live in his attic. While exploiting their work, Vova does not notice that he begins to fall under the influence of his uninvited guests, discovering for himself a heretofore unknown world of spiritual values. Gradually, he begins to understand that beauty is not measured by fashion, that love is not limited to sex, that material riches do not replace spiritual enrichment.

Sloane decides to use her dinner reservations that she had with Andrew to have dinner with Patrick instead. On the date, as she and Patrick are about to kiss, Andrew comes and proposes to Sloane. Sloane says yes, completely forgetting about Patrick. At midnight that night, Caitlin and the spirit of “ex-mas present”, Jason, show Sloane how her thoughtless actions affect those around her. Sloane observes her secretary Ella telling her son that she won’t be home on Christmas Day, Jenny and Ed talking about how Sloane takes her for granted, and her mom finding out that her husband won’t be home for Christmas and will be spending it completely alone. Last, Sloane discovers that Andrew was actually on the phone while talking to her about their engagement and sees how upset Patrick was.

Sloane then goes to visit Patrick at the hospital. Patrick is upset and tells Sloane that he doesn’t like who she is becoming, saying that he “could never fall in love with her now”. As she’s leaving the hospital, Sloane is visited by the spirit of “ex-mas future”, who is dressed like Santa Claus. First, he shows Sloane her mother spending Christmas alone, with the 3 dogs and the maid tried to get her to come join her family. She thinks her mother has gone crazy when she named one of the dogs after her. She often refers the other two dogs as her brothers, but she's always seen her as a human being. The spirit disagrees and tells her that she was lonely because Sloane didn't even bother to come visit her when she needed her. After her mother suffers from another failed marriage with her fifth husband leaving her, she falls apart and has to depend on the dogs for support. The Santa spirit then brings Sloane to the future home of Jenny and Ed where they receive a Christmas card from her. She discovers that Jenny’s restaurant failed because of her forgetfulness to put in the gift cards in the basket and it forced her to be a waitress at Applebee's. Sloane tries to tell him that wasn't her fault, but the spirit doesn't believe her. He tells her that she has to accept responsibility for her actions because Jenny depended on her to help save her restaurant and it lead to them not being friends anymore. Outside the hospital, Sloane thinks he brought her there to show her how much Patrick hates her. The spirit tells her that she never sees him again after she embarrasses herself by ignoring Patrick and accepting Andrew's proposal. He also tells Sloane that she doesn't care about love anymore. She tells off the Santa spirit that she's engaged to Andrew and that she cares about love. He would never become her ex because she loves him. He laughs at her naivety and reveals himself as Andrew, her future ex-husband. After recovering from her shock, Sloane confronts him and states they were supposed to be married. Andrew informs her that they do get married, but also they will get a divorce because of their different lifestyles. She wanted power and wealth, while he wanted to make his marriage work. Andrew mentions that even though Sloane will become extremely wealthy from the divorce by taking half of his company and clients from him, she would still lose everything. He shows her the consequences of her actions that brought her when she continued to behave the way she did by pushing everyone else who depended on her out of her life, she'll end up dying in the hospital alone like Jason and Caitlin's spirit predicted. Realizing her mistake, Sloane begs Andrew to help her fix this because this isn't the future she wanted, but he refuses and leaves her. Sloane wakes up on Christmas Day determined to fix her life. First she goes to her mother's house to reconcile with her and drops her off at Jenny’s for Christmas dinner. Sloane proceeds to go to the movie premiere/memorial, where she gives her secretary permission to go home for the day and puts all of the gift certificates in the gift baskets.

At this point, Caitlin has achieved her mission so she gets her wings and goes up to Heaven. As Sloane is leaving the party, she and Jason end their competition on friendly terms. Sloane goes to the hospital and apologizes to Patrick. She confesses her love for him and tries to convince him that she is still the same person that she was in college. In the end, he forgives her and they share a romantic kiss. Together they go to Jenny’s house for the Christmas dinner.

Hinsley has worked as a production staffer at a major Hollywood studio for over thirty years. His employer D.J. Jr.  fires Hinsley, despite the old man\'s faithful dedication to the company. Hinsley commits suicide by hanging himself. Dennis is swayed by a prominent member of the local English expatriate community to spend most of the money from his uncle\'s estate on a socially prestigious burial at Whispering Glades cemetery and mortuary. There he meets and becomes infatuated with Aimée Thanatogenos , a hopelessly naive and idealistic cosmetician who says she was named after Aimee Semple McPherson. Chief embalmer Mr. Joyboy  is also an admirer, but though she respects him professionally she doesn\'t have any romantic feelings toward him. Aimée\'s idol is the Reverend Wilbur Glenworthy , owner of Whispering Glades. Aimée worships the solemn and pious reverend, but in private he is a calculating businessman who regards Whispering Glades as just a business venture. To raise money, Dennis begins working at Happier Hunting Grounds, a local pet cemetery run by the reverend\'s brother Henry Glenworthy , who has lately been fired by the movie studio as well. Dennis courts Aimée with poetry, which fascinates her though she fails to recognize famous verses. When Aimée asks whether Dennis wrote these passages, he changes the subject. Dennis dares not let Aimée find out where he works since she considers the pet cemetery to be sacrilegious. Aimée is increasingly frustrated by Dennis\' cynical and disrespectful attitude toward Whispering Glades and is shocked at his suggestion that they marry and live on her income when she gets a promotion. So, acting on advice given by Guru Brahmin , actually a drunken staff writer at a newspaper, she accepts a dinner invitation from Mr. Joyboy, who secured her promotion. Thoughts of a serious relationship with Mr. Joyboy are dismissed when she sees his bizarre and unhealthy relationship with his morbidly obese mother whose only interest is food. Again acting on the advice of Guru Brahmin, she becomes engaged to Dennis. She invites him to her home, a partially finished house built on a cliff, condemned and abandoned due to the danger of landslides. He cuts the visit short, alarmed at occasional ominous trembling and Aimée\'s lack of concern over her own safety. Dennis and Henry Glenworthy meet their neighbor, a boy genius ([[Paul Williams  with an interest in rocketry, and they let him set up a lab at the pet cemetery. Mr. Joyboy brings in his pet myna bird to be buried and discovers the identity of his rival. He agrees to have the bird shot into orbit by one of the neighbor\'s rockets, instead of being buried. Mr. Joyboy brings Aimée to the ceremony and she is outraged when she sees Dennis performing the service; this greatly pleases Mr. Joyboy. Reverend Glenworthy, seeing little profit in the cemetery once the plots have been filled, decides to convert it into a retirement home, but is unable to proceed without a plan for dealing with the bodies interred there. When he learns of his brother\'s idea of sending bodies into orbit, he recognizes it as a solution to his own problem. He proceeds to obtain surplus rockets by hosting an orgy at Whispering Glades with top Air Force brass as guests of honor. Dennis, in a desperate attempt to reconcile with Aimée, tells her that Whispering Glades is to be shut down. She flees, but is afraid that what Dennis told her might be true. She seeks out Mr. Joyboy for comfort, but he has been called to the cemetery to prepare a body to be launched into orbit, an ex-astronaut nicknamed "The Condor." She tracks down Guru Brahmin in a bar, but he drunkenly advises her to jump out a window. Finally, she flees to the cemetery and finds Reverend Glenworthy, who confirms Dennis\' story and tries to seduce her with promises of continued employment with higher pay at the new facility. Wholly distraught, since her faith in everything she held sacred has been shattered, she attaches herself to an embalming machine and dies peacefully. Mr. Joyboy finds her body, but is afraid to report it because of the scandal it would cause, so he calls Dennis to dispose of her in the pet cemetery\'s crematorium. Dennis agrees, but only if Mr. Joyboy gives him a first class ticket back to England and all the cash he can lay his hands on. Dennis also imposes the condition that Aimée be placed in the casket headed for space and the Condor be sent to the pet crematorium. After the televised funeral ceremony and launch, Dennis is seen boarding the first class section of a plane to England.'] ['Bale Pandiya  is a young man who leads a troubled life.

After discovering his Aunt has been hiding packages addressed to him, he sneaks down to the mailbox one morning and finds an envelope containing an iPhone, which transports him to Lunar Park in Sydney, Australia. He's met by Mr. Pentangle , an imposing Aboriginal man, who reveals that Ben is part of an ancient magical sect of Wittertainers. The pair journey to a small island off the Australian coast, which is home to Fairport Academy, the magic school that Ben will be attending. While moving into his dorm, Ben meets Scarlett McKenna , a gorgeous co-ed a few years his senior, who casts a spell curing his near-sightedness. At the school assembly, Ben is ignored by the student population, but Scarlett comforts him. The new principal, Bavarian filmmaker Werner Herzog , gives the opening address, warning the students that changes will be made with him in charge. A musical montage shows the next three months Ben's school life. His initial classes with Professor Mumblecore as a disaster, and Ben is the subject of humiliating gossip among his fellow students. He takes advantage of a history project to deliver a presentation on his idol, skiffle legend Johnny Leroy, which wins over his classmates, who applaud him enthusiastically. A chat between Ben and Scarlett shows their relationship beginning to grow closer, as Ben's confidence has grown. He is outfitted with a new wardrobe, and is given a suit belonging to his father as a going away present from Pentangle, who is swimming to Germany to take up his new post as headmaster of Werner Herzog's Rogue Film School. Ben visits Principal Herzog, curious about the history of his family. Herzog tells Ben of his early life, fighting along Ben's father Percy , a secret agent employed by the British government. Percy's career was focused on defeating the machinations of the sinister Lord Emmerich, a vicious mastermind with the head of a gorilla. In flasback, we see Ben's mother Lucy  held hostage by Lord Emmerich in his lair, inside a hollowed out Icelandic volcano. Percy breaks into the facility and confronts Emmerich, defeating him and rescuing his bride. Sensing his defeat, Emmerich sets the self-destruct sequence, causing the volcano to erupt and kill them all. Ben relates his troubles to Scarlett over a game of billiards in the Fairport Academy bar. She reveals she lusted after Ben's father when she was growing up, and they trade innuendo as she beats him decisively. As they get more and more drunk, she delivers a rambling speech to him about hero worship and they almost kiss. The next morning, Ben invites Scarlett down to the disused concert hall, and shows her his plan to resurrect the school's tradition of concerts, which used to be filled by the ghosts of dead rock stars. Ben's strategy is to run school talent quests, then start to bring in notable living performers, like Bruce Springsteen. An impressed Scarlett joins Ben on the stage and they perform a duet of the Fairport Academy School Song. The print becomes scratchy and is replaced by a technical difficulties card. The projectionist  phones the director of the film  and explains that he's lost the next two reels of the film. Dylan is concerned that this skips a number of important plot points, but they conclude that no one will notice. Kenneth restarts the projector. Elvis Costello and Paul McCartney have just left the stage as Ben concludes his performance at the school talent quest to rapturous applause. Later, Ben sleeps uneasily. Ben dreams he's back in the concert hall, watching Johnny Leroy and the Impulsives perform on stage. In the second verse, Leroy transforms into the Lord Emmerich, who leaps down from the stage and menaces Ben, demanding to know the 'secret of the cauldron of penguins'. Ben awakes with a start. Scarlett comes to his door to check on him, but Ben assures her it was merely a bad dream. A concerned Scarlett calls Pentangle in Germany and relays the news. Ben is plagued by another dream involving Lord Emmerich and the Cauldron of Penguins, this time more violent, and awakes in a panic. Scarlett comes to his door again, more concerned, and they sit together in his room and resolve to go to Principal Herzog for advice. She comforts him and they have sex. In his office the next morning, Herzog tells Ben of his concern that Emmerich is using Ben's dreams as a way to regain a footing in the physical world. The only solution is to keep Ben awake indefinitely and Herzog concocts a mixture of energy drinks, coffee and cocaine that Ben reluctantly drinks. He heads to the school library with the mixture, researching penguins in hopes of discovering the solution to the mystery of the cauldron. As he ingests more the mixture and stays awake longer, he begins hallucinating a talking stuffed penguin , who mocks him. Ben punches him repeatedly in the face. Two weeks later, a concerned Pentangle arrives at the library, searching for Ben, who has become totally unhinged. Pentangle cleans him up and tells him that Scarlett and Herzog have been kidnapped by Lord Emmerich, and together they search for clues where they were last seen. Ben finds an iPhone and uses the transporter app to follow them. He appears in Lord Emmerich's hollowed out Icelandic volcano lair, an exact replica of the room where he faced off with Ben's parents. Scarlett is bound and gagged on an operating table and Emmerich stands over her, threatening them with a pistol. He removes his gorilla mask to reveal that he is really Werner Herzog, who created the fictional persona of an eccentric Bavarian filmmaker to escape the authorities after surviving the destruction of his old lair. He reveals his overly elaborate plan in a long-winded speech, then prepares to shoot them both dead. Ben, remembering the layout from the earlier flashback sequence, activates the self-destruct sequence and transports him and Scarlett to safety"] ["The story takes place in Marseille, where Marius, the son of a barkeeper César, has a romance with Fanny, neighbourhood girl of the fish sales man in the harbor.

While singing, the voice boasts of his previous experience in other venues. The voice turns out to belong to a tiny grasshopper, who ends his performance with Blanc\'s trademark pronunciation of "Cuc-amonga". Porky, who is the agency\'s producer and listening to the auditions, tells the grasshopper he might have a spot for him. The rest of the short consists of a series of acts by various performers, most of whom Porky rejects. * A hen  clucks Blue Danube. Porky seems to like this act, but the hen literally "lays an egg" and takes this event in its figurative sense in that her act flopped. Porky pulls a lever next to his desk that sends the hen and the egg with a sad looking chick  in it through a trap door in the floor. * A fox, voiced by Stan Freberg, bursts in telling Porky that his act is the best ever, but Porky tells him that it\'s not his turn yet. * A turtle resembling Cecil Turtle but with Blanc\'s voice says he is the "man of a 1000 voices." He goes through a rapid fire montage of voice impressions . Porky says that he counted only nine hundred ninety nine voices. The turtle is stumped as to what his 1000th voice is and exits the office hoping that he\'ll remember it later . * Bingo the Parrot, Frankie the Rooster, and Al the Duck  sing the popular hit song April Showers, each in the distinctive manner of their namesakes. Porky tells them that he\'ll consider their act but says after they leave that it was a low class act that only bobbysoxers would like . * A two-headed man enters the office. Porky quotes "Oh boy two-headed! This ought to be a sensational act!" The two-headed man quotes "Act, Shmact! I\'m the janitor" as he empties Porky\'s pail into another pail and leaves. * The fox barges into the office again, telling Porky to watch his act. Porky tells him to go back out and wait his turn. * A dog in a bathing suit named J. Fenton Hadding places his briefcase on the floor. It turns out to be a elevated platform that the dog rides through the office skylight 500 feet into the air. The dog then dives into a glass of water that he is holding in his hand . Porky sends the dog stuck in his water glass down the trap door. * Crawford Coo  has a trained pigeon act. He sets up various pigeon-sized acrobatic equipment and releases the pigeons from a box, but the pigeons fly out the window. Crawford tries tap dancing instead, but Porky sends him down the trap door . * The fox bursts in again. Porky sends him down the trap door. * A shaggy dog enters. Porky thinks it\'s a dog act, but the dog hands him a business card, announcing that he is the Itch and Scratch Flea Circus. The dog blows a whistle and fleas hop from his back to build a tiny circus tent and carnival midway, then dismantle it when the dog blows the whistle again. The music played here is the Wackyland Rubber Band music featured in the shorts Tin Pan Alley Cats and Dough for the Do-do. Finally, it is the fox\'s turn to do his act. He dons a devil\'s costume and swallows atomic powder, TNT, gasoline, and finally, a lit match. BOOM! Porky thinks the act is terrific, but the fox  comes through the office door and says that there is only one tiny problem with the act: he can only do it once!'] ['Anand ([[Napoleon , a veterinarian, and Raja , a doctor, are brothers.

The film looks at the build-up to the debate, the controversy around the film Life of Brian, and dramatizes segments from the televised discussion. The film begins with the Pythons returning from filming Life of Brian in Tunisia. At a meeting in the offices of their film distributor they discuss allowing the film to be released in America first. Cleese voices his support for the idea, and says that he loves Americans. We then see American reporters at a screening of the movie where a near riot is taking place due to the alleged "blasphemous" nature of the film. The Pythons review a disheartening statement made by a religious leader, implying that the film causes violence. Cleese misinterprets this  and goes off on a tangent about little kids carrying out copycat crucifixions on their friends. Terry Gilliam quickly rips up some magazines and creates an animation about the team writing the film in hell with Satan as their head writer. Their distributor, Barry, suggests a low profile approach for the UK release so as not to cause too much upset. "Let\'s not project an advert onto the side of Westminster Abbey or make Life of Brian Christmas crackers".'] ['Bulbul Maina is the story of Srikanth Mussolini, played by Indrajith, his life, love and the relationship with Reema Kallingal, the heroine.'] ["Vasu  is a strong willed reckless guy.

The title card and technical credits are followed by introductions of the two lead characters: "F.H.A.  Homes" as police chief "Flat-Foot Flanigan with a Floy Floy," and "Edward G. Robemsome"  as notorious gang leader "Killer Diller." After these introductions, Killer and his gang are seen robbing every bank in the town in numerical order  — with the newspaper Telegraph Post reporting the criminals\' every move, and even declaring that they have robbed 87 banks in a single day.

After a night playing together, James\'s grandmother becomes suspicious of her grandson and begins to spy on him, particularly after she starts to see him acting in mysterious ways. Finally, the Grandmother begins to take up the floorboards and discovers her missing things, notably the artifacts from her dollhouse. The Clock family escape to the sewers, where Pod  berates his daughter for having \'spoken to, let alone been seen by a human bean\'. The Clock family travel down the sewers and emerge in a city of other little people like themselves, much to Arrietty\'s dismay, as she had been brought to believe that their family was the only one of their kind. Meanwhile, Professor Mildeye , a professor at a London university, is specialising in the subject of Homo sapiens redactus  but is dismissed by his colleagues as a fantasist. He befriends James\'s grandmother when she begins to ask him questions about little people, having found out about him online. The Clock family start to explore their new world. Arrietty, with a new urban fashion sense, is nearly run over by Spiller , a biker-type leader. After a confrontation with her, Homily Clock  turns up and makes him apologise, much to Arrietty\'s annoyance. When it turns out that Arrietty\'s father has chosen him to guide them to a new place to live, they strike up a friendship of sorts. Professor Mildeye arrives at James\'s house, determined to find the Clock family in order to examine them dead or alive. James, feigning disbelief at the existence of little people, becomes wary as these events develop. Arrietty then starts playing with the snowflakes as Pod and Homily have a talk about her "mistake". After explaining what snow is to Arriety, and after giving her a heated heart-to-heart about the protected life she\'s had, Arrietty storms off in anger, but activates a trap set out to capture them by Professor Mildeye. Pod and Homily push her out of the way but become trapped themselves. Pod tells Spiller to take care of Arriety and they escape as Pod and Homily are captured and brought to Mildeye\'s laboratory. Spiller tries to explain that he tried everything to save Pod and Homily, but Arrietty is determined to and save them. Spiller is shocked and says she will be killed, but they depart on hostile terms. In Professor Mildeye\'s laboratory, Pod thinks about how to escape, but is happy that his daughter is safe. Professor Mildeye leaves a message on the Hellman family\'s answer phone explaining to James\'s grandmother that he has captured Pod and Homily. James intercepts it, and listens in horror before deleting it and rushing off to the university. Meanwhile, Arrietty ventures above ground and is nearly killed by a street cleaning vehicle, but is rescued by Spiller who has reappeared. They head off to a church and hide in the Nativity scene while they work out what to do next. Spiller explains that Pod is a hero in the little world, as he saved their community from the human beans, but he failed to save a little girl, as he was faced with a terrible choice: Arrietty\'s cousin Eggletina or the entire community. Spiller adds that no-one blamed him for her death, but Pod blamed himself and exiled himself to the Hellman\'s house to live away from the little people community. Spiller agrees to help Arrietty save her parents. They head back to James Hellman\'s house, as she is sure he can help them. Pod and Homily attempt to escape but are captured by Mildeye as they hide behind a table leg. As he recaptures them, he discovers they can talk. James arrives at the university, feigning surprise that the Professor was right and the Borrowers do exist. Back home, the grandmother takes a bunch of flowers from the postman which are from Mildeye, who has become infatuated with her. James\'s dad arrives home with a model aircraft which is a Christmas present for James. James explains to Arrietty and Spiller that Homily and Pod are still alive. Spiller tries to attack James, but Arrietty explains that he\'s trustworthy. They watch a news clip from BBC News of the anchorman explaining Mildeye\'s theory, and that there would be a scientific conference the following day. The following morning, James heads to the university with the model aircraft which he found hidden under his late mum\'s bed, as Mildeye prepares for the conference. Spiller and Arrietty get inside the aircraft, and James launches it  and flies them above the university building from where, after an intimate moment during which the couple nearly kiss, they are dropped onto the building by makeshift parachutes. They make their way through the air conditioning system to a vent above the glass that Pod and Homily are being kept in. Meanwhile, James goes inside the university and distracts Mildeye that there are whole communities of little people living underground. Mildeye calls his assistant out of the lab, giving Arrietty and Spiller a chance to rescue Pod and Homily. At first, Homily is shocked to find Pod smiling, laughing and looking upwards as his daughter and Spiller are rescuing them using string and a paperclip. Mildeye being in the corridor talking to his assistant about James\'s revelation gives James a chance to open the air conditioning vent in the Professor\'s office to put a modified remote control car inside for the Borrowers to use as an escape vehicle. James leaves Mildeye\'s office, and gives Mildeye a board marker. The Professor and his assistant rush back to the office to find that James has drawn silly faces on magazine cut-outs of Mildeye which are hung on the wall. Mildeye realises that his "specimens" are in danger and rushes back to the lab, gaining entry just as Pod is being lifted up towards the air vent. As Mildeye tries to grab him, Spiller attaches himself to the other end of the string and jumps down through the vent, causing Pod to shoot up into it. Spiller, now in the lab, quickly escapes Mildeye and his assistant. The Clock family escape as Arrietty drives the modified remote control car through the air vents, while Mildeye chases the sound of the car through the corridors below. They leave the air conditioning system and drive through the corridors as Mildeye chases them. They make it into a lift in the nick of time, while Mildeye rushes down the stairs. As the lift opens, Arrietty drives the car full speed down a corridor and out over a balcony to the reception area below where James is waiting with a rucksack to catch them. Mildeye arrives at the balcony to see James running away. When they are safely back home, the Clock family and James watch the conference online to see if Mildeye has caught Spiller. When it appears that he has, Mildeye reveals a doll\'s jacket, much to the mirth of the crowds of press and scientists. They all leave the lecture theatre, leaving Mildeye raging, desperate and humiliated. As James closes the laptop, Spiller appears behind it announcing, "Did you really think they\'d catch me?" Arrietty finally admits she likes him, to which Spiller says that the only reason he rescued them was to have the gold coin. James picks up the coin, which turns out to be the missing rare coin that his Grandmother was asking about. James puts the coin on the floor of his mum\'s bedroom, where his Grandmother later finds it. It turns out that the coin is incredibly valuable, and James and his father sell it to raise money for their house and for Christmas. James\'s dad is puzzled as to why all of the strawberry cream chocolates are missing from a chocolate tin — earlier in the film, we see Pod \'borrowing\' them. Under the floorboards, the Clocks and Spiller have their own Christmas, and Pod and Homily reveal to Arrietty that they\'re ready to allow her to leave the confines of their underfloor home to go wherever she wants. She is overjoyed, and decides she wants to head back to the Borrower city with Spiller. Outside, James and the Clocks say goodbye to Arrietty, and Arrietty and Spiller slide down the drainpipe and the film ends with a still of Arrietty shooting out of the pipe in mid-air. In the post credits, the Grandmother is seen slipping a strawberry cream chocolate down the hole to the Clocks\' home, and whispering "Merry Christmas".'] ['Swapna Sanchari revolves around the gulf-returned Ajaychandran Nair .

Afterwards, the tour guide gives them each a dram of whisky and asks them to smell it, and Robbie is complimented on his ability to identify flavours. At the next community service session, Harry approaches Robbie and asks if he\'d like to come to a whisky tasting session in Edinburgh. Robbie, in turn, invites the other members of the group, where they learn about a cask of priceless whisky, the "malt mill", set to go on auction soon, and Robbie is passed a card by a whisky collector, Thaddeus .

Amy then apologises as well and, at the Doctor\'s confusion, explains that Rory was looking up her skirt through the glass floor when he dropped the thermal coupling. The Doctor then notes that they have landed through "emergency materialisation" which should have landed the TARDIS in the safest space available.

Angelica starts counting to ten for them to come out, and Tommy suggests they go to "the foocher"  so that they will be grown up enough for Angelica not to boss them about any more. Angelica says multiple random numbers in incorrect order before reaching 10, so this gives the babies enough time to rig the karaoke machine into a time-travel device. At the exact moment Angelica reaches ten, Tommy pushes a button and there is a swirling orange vortex and the babies see themselves in the future. Coincidentally, they are now ten years older.

Matsuko's relationships with men were generally troubled as well. She moved from relationship to relationship with men who gave her some inkling of affection, though it was often accompanied by abuse. She often found herself abandoned by the men she loved, who couldn't cope with her neediness. She continued to pursue her dreams of perfect love, even as her life spiraled down, and she found herself working as a prostitute, and even imprisoned.

He knocks on the door and Bugs, slightly bemused by the addition to his property, opens it. The Coyote proclaims, in his very first spoken line of dialogue ever, that he is a genius, as well as being faster, taller, and stronger than Bugs, and that he intends to eat the rabbit. He goes on to advise Bugs that it is futile to try and escape, since Bugs "could hardly pass the entrance examinations to kindergarten", an insult Bugs does not seem to react to  An unimpressed Bugs replies, "I\'m sorry, Mac, the lady of the house ain\'t home. And besides, we mailed you people a check last week," then slams the door in Wile E.\'s face. The Coyote goes back to his cave hideout , asking himself: "Why do they always want to do it the hard way?" The Coyote\'s first plan to trap Bugs is to build a pressure cooker on top of the rabbit hole and cook Bugs alive. He chops up vegetables, throws them down the hole, adds an egg, a drop of cooking oil, some seasoning, tosses it into a salad, then places the pressure cooker on top. Bugs watches Wile E.\'s work from another hole , then walks up to him and asks "What\'s cookin\', Doc?" When informed that Wile E. is cooking "rabbit stew" , Bugs casually observes, "there\'s only one little thing wrong with it", that there is no rabbit . As Wile E. frantically looks under the cooker, Bugs gives him a big kick down the hole and sticks the cooker on top of Wile E. He then picks up a bat, goes back down the second hole, and clobbers the Coyote  at the other hole, prompting the Coyote to remark: "Well, back to the old drawing board." In the next scene, the Coyote prepares his second plan: the use of a chute for firing a cannon ball into Bugs\' hole. After the ball arrives in the hole via the chute from a cannon, Bugs uses a second chute to return the ball to the Coyote, where it explodes on target, causing the Coyote\'s plan to quite literally backfire on him. Bugs then goes to the Coyote\'s cave to claim that he is surrendering "on account of I cannot fight no more against such genius," but he wants Wile E. to sign as a witness to his last will and testament. He gives the Coyote the document and a "pen", which is really a burning stick of dynamite. Wile E. knows that it\'s dynamite and puts out the fuse . While he gloats , it is revealed that there is another fuse at the other end of the TNT stick, which explodes on cue. The Coyote then returns to his cave and builds a mechanical  lady rabbit that will be used as a decoy to trap Bugs.  Bugs, however, has anticipated this plan, and built an explosive lady coyote in response . Bugs detonates the coyote robot just as Wile is romantically embracing it. Then, because Wile E. was so distracted that he forgot about the rabbit robot , it explodes in his cave as well. The Coyote then creates an exploding flying saucer with a radarscope mechanism able to detect birds, mice, and rabbits. The disc flies to Bugs\' hole, but Bugs thwarts it by putting on a chicken mask. The disguised Bugs then writes in "Coyote" on the radarscope\'s target options and moves the dial there. The saucer speeds back to the Coyote\'s home, blew up the whole mountain to smithereens. The Coyote makes one last plan: While admiring his self-status as a "Super Genius," he fills a series of carrots with explosive liquid nitroglycerin inside his alternate home—a ramshackle shack. Bugs, using a tractor, drags the shack to the desert\'s railroad track, where a train is approaching. When the train hits the shack, all of the explosives in Wile E\'s stockpile explodes and launches him high into the air. "\'Wile E. Coyote - Super Genius\'", he groans in self-sarcasm while he was holding a tree branch on the edge of the cliff all burned up, finally admitting to himself that the rabbit has outwitted him. The Coyote, still dazed and covered in ash, returns to Bugs\' hole, rebuilds his door, knocks on it and admits defeat. "Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Mud," he says to Bugs before passing out.'] ['Set in Victorian London, a young aristocrat, Jack Armstrong , is desperate to win the love of his beloved and greedy, Lady Alice Faversham .Donald C.

Solo contacts Lancer’s daughter Lorelei, a model at the Paris salon of Madame Raine De Sala. De Sala orders her associate Olga and another model Do Do to make sure that Lorelei does not speak to Solo. De Sala herself visits Sir Norman Swickert, a very old statesman she knew and admired as a child, and brings along with her Dr. Gritsky – a colleague of Dr. Lancer. Swickert complains of being too old to have political power anymore, and De Sala reveals her desire for such power as he once had, her resentment of not having it available to her since she is a woman, and her ability to make him a younger man with Gritsky’s help. Meanwhile, Solo’s efforts to contact Lorelei result in Do Do and Olga acting together to kill her rather than have her speak to Solo. Solo discovers this when he is lured to Lorelei’s apartment and, after a fight with Do Do, discovers both Lorelei’s body and a note to Lorelei that she could contact her father through Philip Bainbridge. Solo attempts to contact Bainbridge in London , but Swickert is speaking with him first. Swickert becomes convinced that the middle-aged Bainbridge is actually the elderly Lancer made young again via a medical process. Olga has followed Solo and, in attempting to kill him, accidentally kills Bainbridge/Lancer. A chase and fight ensues with the result being the escape of Olga and the death of Do Do. Having seen Swickert with Lancer, Solo visits Swickert at his country estate and questions him about Bainbridge and Lancer. Swickert refuses to say much beyond that Lancer was a member of the Bridge of Lions club, a private chess club that Swickert founded to build a bridge among the great men of many nations to allow them freedom to communicate under all circumstances – thereby reducing the chances of cataclysms like World War I. Shortly after leaving Swickert’s home, Solo’s car crashes as a result of sabotage – implied to be the work of Olga. Solo is found by THRUSH agent Jordin, who advises U.N.C.L.E. of Solo’s predicament and location.  Kuryakin, still investigating the missing cats, tracks one of them to a laboratory. He find the cat de-aged to a kitten and the man said to have been capturing the cats, Corvy, dead by a hat pin. Solo  arrives as well and, after comparing notes the two men reach the conclusion that the cats, having a similar nervous system to humans, are being experimented upon with the de-aging process developed by Lancer and Gritsky. Kuryakin finds that hat associated with the pin and it turns out to be from Madame Raine De Sala’s salon. From this point on they collaborate on their assignments. Solo and Kuryakin next break into Swickert’s home and are captured by Swickert’s guard and Olga. Tossed into a wine press with the press descending, they are left for dead. They nonetheless figure out how to brace the press and are eventually released by Jordin after everyone else leaves the estate. After a brief interrogation by Jordin, the U.N.C.L.E. agents overpower him and, while he escapes, are again free. In very short order Swickert is de-aged and regains his stature as a man of power. Solo and Kuryakin confront him and demand the secret of rejuvenation. Jordin, listening covertly to their conversation, captures Gritsky and blackmails De Sala: he will only provide continued curative treatments to Swickert if De Sala uses her influence to make Swickert do THRUSH’s bidding in political matters. Solo finds out and is captured again. Because of his past association with Swickert, Waverly travels to England to speak to him, but is also captured by Jordin and placed with Solo. Swickert, having taken another treatment with Gritsky and learning of THRUSH’s plans for him, decides that Gritsky and his secret must die to keep anyone else from suffering his fate. Jordin saves Gritsky, but Swickert goes on to give a political speech wherein he explains enough of THRUSH’s plans that Jordin draws a gun. De Sala jumps in front on Swickert to protect him and ends up shot and killed in his stead. Solo, having escaped with Waverly via an incidiary rope in Waverly’s tie, meets up with Kuryakin and investigate Gritsky’s laboratory. They find Gritsky has taken Swickert’s worries to heart and committed suicide by de-aging rapidly to a child. Jordin comes in, takes Gritsky’s notes, and destroys the de-aging machine so no one else can have it. But Gritsky booby-trapped the machine and Jordin is killed. Solo and Kuryakin return to New York, and since the secret of the de-aging process is written in code, it appears to be lost to science for a very long time.'] ["Oswald and the girl beagle are on a camel, riding through the Egyptian desert.

To get away from the stress, Sam\'s wife, Anne  suggests a tropical vacation in a cabana far away in the Pacific for the wedding of his deputy, Joe Foster  and his secretary Marla . Sam reluctantly agrees, after reinforcement from his doctor . Meanwhile, the FBI has dug up the anti-freeze used to dissolve Jack in the first movie, attempting to test it for remains of the genetic material. One of the janitors  accidentally spills a cup of coffee into the tank of antifreeze, waking Jack up and causing him to reform and break free. He heads for the tropics, due to the idea that since Sam was wounded by Jack  in the first movie, and his blood dripped into the anti-freeze used to dissolve him, Jack is linked to Sam\'s psyche. Sam, Anne, Marla and Joe, arrive at the tropics to a greeting by the eccentric Colonel Hickering  and his assistants Captain Fun  and Bobby . The festivities quickly begin, but things get deadly when Jack washes ashore and kills three ladies by: transforming himself into an ice anvil and crushing Ashlea , impaling his icicles into Paisley , and stabbing a pair of tongs into Rose \'s eyes. The next morning, the Colonel discovers the bodies and tries to cover up the whole mess, as he does not want this to ruin his resort. However, the island\'s manager, Agent Manners , suspects that Jack has returned. Jack continues his rampage, killing a beach model named Sarah  by making her head explode  and stabbing her cameraman  to death with his carrot nose. Sam begins to suspect that something is amiss when he runs into Manners, who agrees to an alliance in order to stop Jack Frost. Sam, the Colonel, and Manners stage a trap to capture Jack. This fails as the snowman they capture was really the Colonel in costume. Jack, after slaying another beach model named Cindy  by drowning her in the pool by freezing it, decides that the tropics are a bit too warm and freezes the place, causing it to snow and freeze the lifeguard . The party guests begin to play around in snowball fights when Jack enters the fray, killing at least another dozen. Sam, Anne, Marla, Manners and Joe lock themselves up in their room, using anti freeze to keep Jack at bay. Sam and Manners decide to find help, and end up finding a room where the Colonel, Captain Fun, and Bobby have barricaded themselves in. Sam asks the three of them where they can find anti-freeze, to which Bobby suggests they use the coolant in the freezer . Luring Jack into a trap, Sam once again tricks Jack into a pool of anti-freeze. Unfortunately, this does not work, as Jack has become much more resilient to the anti-freeze due to his time in the lab. Jack spits out a snowball and flees, followed by Manners, into the woods. Sam, Anne, and the others observe a snowball. The snowball "hatches" and becomes a baby snowman, who kills Captain Fun. They trap the snowman in a blender and try many different ways of killing it, all of which fail. Meanwhile, Manners has followed Jack to a shed, where he sees that Jack has spit up many, many snowball children. He calls the others and tells them what he has seen, but before leaving he is attacked and devoured by the tiny snowmen. Sam, in panic since the antifreeze does not work, is pushed to the side as Anne takes charge in order get Joe and Colonel to go around the island to trap as many of the snowmen as they can until the supply boat  comes, while Bobby, Marla and Sam wait back in the kitchen. During the search, the snowmen kill seven more tourists. Eventually, Anne realizes that they can be killed by bananas, due to Sam being allergic to bananas. As a result, Jack would share the same vulnerabilities, since he absorbed some of Sam\'s genetics in Snowmonton. This angers Jack, who stabs Colonel through the head with an icicle from behind and slits Bobby\'s throat with another icicle. Marla and Joe flee and lock themselves in the freezer with Captain Fun\'s body, while Anne is attacked by Jack. Sam snaps out of his paranoia and shoots Jack with a banana attached to an arrow, causing him to explode. Anne and Sam embrace each other, and walk towards the ocean, prepared to leave the island with any of the other surviving guests. During the credits the two sailors on the supply boat are crushed by a giant carrot, implying Jack is still alive and that there will be a sequel. After the credits roll, we\'re shown that Joe and Marla were accidentally left in the freezer by Sam and Anne, and it\'s implied that the couple froze to death in the freezer.'] ["The adventure begins on Halloween with Skylar, a fearless teenager with a powerful singing voice, prepares for the ultimate Halloween bash with her best friends, Henry and Sadie.

After many unsuccessful attempts to launch rockets to the moon , Professor Dingledong becomes the first man to reach the moon, but, two years later, hasn\'t returned to Earth. In the present day, at the Interplanetary Rocket Society, Professor P. Cosmo Clonk asks the other scientists if one of them will volunteer for the next manned mission to the moon. The scientists just look at each other until it boils down to Fido, the society\'s mascot, but Fido gulps and immediately pretends to have the measles. Professor Clonk tries to coax Fido to stop delaying the progress of science, but Fido, still refusing to go first tries pretending he isn\'t Fido and shows his master pictures of his family . Woody Woodpecker enters the scene as a volunteer telegram delivery man and presents a telegram to Professor Clonk, informing him of an overdue phone bill . Professor Clonk is offended by the telegram, but after Woody points out his volunteer work, this gives Professor Clonk an idea to have Woody be the next astronaut. Straight afterwards, at the rocket launching site, the society members wish Woody "bon voyage" and are immediately charred  as Woody blasts off in the rocket. While traveling through space, Woody opens the hatches to let a Sputnik satellite  pass through. The rocket then lands safely on the moon, where we see the remains of Professor Dingledong\'s rocket  and that Dingledong is still alive. Upon seeing the recently arrived spaceship, Dingledong rejoices at being rescued and gives Woody a rather mushy welcome by kissing him. Dingledong jumps at the idea of a woodpecker piloting a rocket, to which Woody states "Who were you expecting? Miss Universe?" Unaware that Woody is listening in, Dingledong makes a plan to hijack the rocket and leave Woody stranded on the moon. As part of the plan, Dingledong takes Woody on a tour of the moon. As he shows Woody a crater, Woody questions on how deep the crater is, to which Dingledong kicks Woody into the crater, making him fall off the moon on the other side. As Dingledong reaches Woody\'s rocket, he laments on having volunteered for the mission that led to his being marooned on the moon and justifies his recent actions to the audience by confessing that he\'s so homesick after spending two years stuck on the moon. Before Dingledong can board the rocket, Woody reappears and punches him with a boxing glove. Woody then chastises Dingledong for his actions and puts the key to the rocket down his feathers. Wanting the key, Dingledong chases Woody into the rocket. Just as it looks like Dingledong will corner Woody, Woody whips out an atom blaster ray gun and fires it at Dingledong. After the ray passes through him, Dingledong states it didn\'t do a thing, but soon finds out it did the hard way when his lower half runs away, making him call it back. Woody tries to flee into another section of the rocket, but Dingledong forces him at ray gunpoint to surrender the key. Woody gladly obliges and Dingledong kicks him off the rocket. Dingledong inserts the key, but a closeup reveals it\'s the key to the ejector seat, which launches Dingledong through the roof and into the air. Right after Dingledong states he made a boo-boo, he falls to the ground. Woody places a door on the ground and opens it so that Dingledong falls through the doorway and deep underground. After removing the door, Woody gets back aboard the rocket and prepares to return to Earth, but Dingledong  forces him at gunpoint to bring him back to Earth. Straight after the rocket blasts off, it leaves Dingledong behind, making him say "Well, that\'s the way the cookie crumbles." The rocket, however, returns and snags Dingledong onto its nose, making him burn his butt upon reentering the Earth\'s atmosphere. Upon arriving in Los Angeles, the rocket zips around the Los Angeles City Hall and crashes into the top floor, where the scientists of the Interplanetary Rocket Society  are having their latest meeting. Dingledong crashes through the table and right into Professor Clonk, at which both professors shout out each other\'s names to each other . In the last scene, angered that he\'d been sent to the moon for nothing, Dingledong ties Professor Clonk to a large firework rocket  and  lights the fuse, launching Professor Clonk to the moon. As Dingledong walks away and says goodbye to Woody, we see a firework rocket  tied to his back, which launches him to the moon after his former superior. Woody, holding a lit match in his hand, bids farewell to Dingledong, gives his trademark laugh, and an all knowing smirk at the fade-out.'] ['Abraham Rodriguez, known as Popi to his sons Luis and Junior, supports them by working three jobs, leaving him little time to supervise them.

The next day they go to the tournament, Quincy, Wendell and Chris each win in their respective first rounds. Sheldon  appears, after having been released from the hospital. Quincy admits to Tracy that he loves her and his feelings for her, but Wendell convinces everyone to think it\'s "smack talk", which inadvertently humiliates and embarrasses Tracy in front of everyone and further worsens the rift between Quincy and Tracy. Tracy, however, who knows that is not true, is not sure about what he said. For the final event, Wendell asks Quincy if he\'ll work with him to destroy Chris and when they win they will share the award fifty-fifty.

He offers a script to the Warner Brothers executive "J.L.", called The Scarlet Pumpernickel, which he wrote himself  As Daffy reads the script to J.L., the cartoon cuts away to various scenes and then back to J.L.\'s office. Each time, Daffy announces a page number. By the cartoon\'s end, the script has exceeded 2 thousand pages . In this script, the clumsy Scarlet Pumpernickel  must save the Fair Lady Melissa from being married to a man she does not love, the Grand Duke ([[Sylvester  under the Lord High Chamberlain\'s  orders. Melissa loves Scarlet, but her happy mood is extinguished in a heartbeat when the Chamberlain orders her to "Keep away from that masked ma-d-d-d-d-a-des-fradle-d-d-d-d... that masked stinker!". The Chamberlain gets a brilliant plan and decides to marry Melissa to the Grand Duke in exchange for killing the Scarlet Pumpernickel. As planned, the Scarlet Pumpernickel is drawn to town to interrupt the wedding. He arrives disguised as a noble and uses the disguise to research and develop his plan for rescuing Melissa. Storming the wedding ceremony as she is walking up the aisle, he is instantly successful as Melissa tears herself from her father\'s arms and runs from the chapel, dragging Scarlet with her . Scarlet takes her back to the inn where he was staying, and leaves briefly. The Grand Duke stops for respite at the inn and spots Melissa on the staircase. He chases her and is bearing down upon her when Scarlet swings in. Notably in this segment of the plot there is a running gag in which Daffy compares his own daring stunts with those of Errol Flynn. The Grand Duke and the Scarlet Pumpernickel engage in an intense duel, but no conclusive ending is given as to who ultimately wins the battle. Daffy, as the scriptwriter, having only thought of the beginning and middle of the story, and being pressured by the enthusiastic "J.L.", overdoes the ending as an unlikely series of random and accelerating natural disasters, including skyrocketing food prices , to which surprisingly, J.L. asks, "is that all?" At his wit\'s end, Daffy shoots through his hat in exhaustion, commenting, "It\'s getting so you have to kill yourself to sell a story around here". See Censorship for more details about the ending.'] ['This version of the classical story "Little Red Riding Hood" is a sort of black comedy. The black-and-white scenario shows the forest of the tale and a narrator is the only speaking character. A wolf – clearly a man in disguise – tries to trick the girl. He successfully eats the grandmother, and then tries to eat the girl. However, the girl tricks him in turn and survives. She is clever enough not to need any huntsman. She does not "rescue" the eaten grandmother at all. In fact she eats her flesh as well, even after being warned by the cat. Combined with the teasing of the wolf after she escaped to make him follow her this short movie presents an image of "Little Red Riding Hood" that is mildly put: "not entirely innocent." As such the movie is clearly based on one of the earliest version of the Little Red Riding Hood fairytale, known as "The False Grandmother."'] ['A grandmother mouse is telling her granddaughter a bedtime story, and so tells of Little Red Riding Hood , and her visit to Grandma\'s House, unaware that the wolf  is watching her. He takes a shortcut to Grandma\'s, only to find four others already there, who he forces out. Red comes along, and he speaks his cue line,  starting the chase. He pursues Red down the staircase, only to be propelled further than intended by a stick of butter. Sylvester then decides to blow the house up with dynamite, but accidentally sticks it into Hector\'s mouth, who then sticks it in the cat\'s mouth until it blows up. Sylvester next disguises himself as Red\'s fairy godmother, attempting to electrocute Red with a rigged wand. Sylvester\'s incantation is "ragg mopp" in reference to the 1950 pop song Rag Mop by The Ames Brothers. However, Hector unplugs the power so that it doesn\'t work. He then plugs it back in just as Sylvester tests it on himself. The mouse then tries to go outside, but is trapped once again. Underneath a cup, Sylvester watches as the mouse prepares something, revealed to be a miniature tank that packs a punch. He then traps the mouse by its hole. The grandmother describes how, to save herself, the mouse threw a stick of dynamite out, doing so to demonstrate. The mouse claims that it must have blown the cat up, to which Sylvester replies, "You\'re not just whistling dixie, brother!"'] ['Amply-contoured mortuary cosmetician, Grace Hart , rides the subway everyday.

After they come out in cans , Tom cuts the top with his nail and releases himself. When Jerry sees Tom, he jumps and runs outside of the can factory, with Tom chasing him, making the fish cans spill everywhere. Jerry in his can rolls out of the way as Tom is carried out by the rolling fish cans and off the pier, and Tom glides through the air and stops as his tail, then his arm, and then his body register that gravity is imminent. Tom dangles in midair, has his face stretched, and finally falls into the sea. Tom soon jumps out of the water, white with fear, followed by a huge, hungry shark. The cat grabs onto an offshoot of the pier and pulls himself down so as to flip himself just out of the way of the attacking shark below him. The cat is then splattered with a drop of water and jumps back onto the pier as the shark laughs evilly. Tom responds by throwing an anchor onto the receding shark's head, causing it to badmouth the cat as Tom taunts it. Tom returns to chasing the mouse when he hears his can clattering across the wood floor. Jerry stops at Tom's foot and leaps into the air, but is then caught and opened. The cat repeatedly shakes the open can to get the mouse out of it with no results, and sticks a finger inside to get bitten by the mouse, with painful results. He finally pulls Jerry out of the can and both of them realize the situation; Jerry releases his death grip, shows his smile to the camera, and kicks Tom's face as he starts the chase. The two chase through the huts and across the pier until Jerry stops at the end of the pier while Tom goes off the end. The cat looks back to see Jerry waving at him and can barely turn back around before he slams into a porthole, taking on its shape, and then falling into the sea to meet the shark once again. Tom swims out of the way and the shark continues to snap at him. The cat climbs a ladder while the shark eats through the wood columns under the pier. The shark swims back and takes a leap towards the cat on top of the pier and is smacked on the head with an oar before falling back into the water. It emerges and glares at Tom as the cat taunts him once again... only this time the shark leaps out of the water and grabs Tom  in its jaws. Jerry peers through the resulting hole at the terrifying situation below: Tom is hanging onto the oar, which braces the shark's mouth open. He breaks this brace, but Tom uses his legs to brace instead, staving off doom for a little longer. Fortunately, Jerry saves him by dumping an entire canister of pepper into the shark's mouth, causing the leviathan to sneeze and launch itself around the water and into the can factory, turning into a big can with his frowning picture on it. Jerry relaxes and gets a halo for his good deed, but an ungrateful Tom grabs him and pops Jerry's halo with devil horns that appear on his head, chuckling evilly. Jerry chuckles innocently and sneezes himself out of the cat's hand, off his horns, and into the water, immediately followed by the cat. Tom scans the scene only to find another shark fin on a beeline towards him! Tom panics and swims away at lightning speed, with the fin keeping pace. The fin, however, is actually Jerrys creation, who is now shown swimming underneath the water. Jerry turns his head towards the camera with an evil grin on his face and grows his own devil horns as he continues to swim after the cat."] ['No prints of the film have been preserved so the film can be considered a lost film.

A customer comes to them, and while sampling the product they start a game of cards, which eventually leads to a fight. While the fight is going on, the local police shows up and arrests the makers while the customer manages to escape.Translated and paraphrased from an original advertisement for the film, as quoted by Hans Kutter in Uutisaitta magazine .

Venkat, who hails from a middle class family, wants to be a wildlife photographer, but is studying engineering because his father wants him to be an engineer. Senthil, hailing from a poor family, is studying engineering to raise his family\'s fortunes and get them out of poverty. On the other hand, Pari is studying engineering for his simple passion in machines and devices. Pari believes that success in studying is not achieved by solely memorizing definitions given by textbooks or professors, but by understanding and applying the concepts. He believes that one should follow excellence, not success, as success will come itself if excellence is followed. However, this different approach is sneered upon by the faculties, including the dean of the college, Professor Virumandi "Virus" Santhanam . Virus and the faculty favour Pari\'s classmate Srivatsan , also known as "Silencer", who is the complete opposite of Pari, believing in mindless memorising over understanding, in order to reach his goals of corporate and social status. Pari constantly spars with Virus and Srivatsan due to their differences in their educational approaches. Pari also believes in the concept of "All Is Well", in which people should focus on the present and live it as it is, instead of worrying over the future as in the case of Senthil, who constantly thinks of the fate of his unmarried elder sister and his paralysed father. Meanwhile, Pari falls in love with Virus\' daughter Ria , a medical student, when he, Venkat and Senthil meet her when they accidentally crash her elder sister Swetha\'s  wedding reception to obtain a free meal. Ria is not impressed with Pari\'s antics and complains to her father about them. Virus becomes furious with Pari and his friends, labels them as "idiots" and tries to break the friendship between the 3 of them by telling Senthil and Venkat that Pari is a bad influence on them. While Venkat refuses to break his friendship with Pari, Senthil believes Virus\' words and distances himself from Pari. However, when Pari saves Senthil\'s father\'s life, who had suffered a heart attack, by taking him immediately to the hospital where Ria works on the latter\'s scooter when the ambulance had not come, Senthil becomes grateful to Pari and reconciles with him. Ria too appreciates Pari\'s practicality and concern for others and falls in love with him. Later, in the semester examination, Pari tops his batch, proving that the his approach to studies does succeed. 3 years later, Pari, Venkat and Senthil break into Virus\'s house in a drunken state one night to allow Pari to confess his love to Ria. Venkat and Senthil cause a ruckus and urinate on the front door before fleeing. Unfortunately, Virus notices Senthil and the next day, he threatens to expel him unless he snitches on Pari. Not wanting to betray his friend or let down his family, Senthil attempts suicide by jumping from Virus\' office window and ends up paralysed. Following his recovery, Senthil discards his fear of the future. Encouraged by Pari, both Senthil and Venkat gain courage to do what they were afraid to do before. Senthil takes a bold and frank approach in a campus interview, while Venkat tries to convince his parents to allow him to pursue his love of wildlife photography. Both Senthil and Venkat are successful in their endeavours. When Virus discovers that Senthil is successfully placed in a company, he creates an extremely tough final semester question paper, so that Senthil fails the examination and would not be allowed to join the company. When Ria learns of her father\'s plan, she helps Pari and Venkat to leak the question paper by providing them with the keys to her father\'s office. However, Virus catches them and expels them on the spot. Ria angrily confronts her father, revealing to him that his son  wanted to be a writer, but was forced to apply for engineering in IEC because of him. As he could not get selected there, he committed suicide. At the same time, Swetha, who is pregnant, goes into labour. A heavy thunderstorm cuts all power and floods the streets, making it impossible for the ambulance to reach Swetha, and Ria is stuck at the hospital, where she had gone for work. Pari, Venkat and Senthil, along with other students from IEC, deliver the baby using the available equipment and the inverter developed by Pari, with Ria instructing him via VoIP. When they discover that the newborn baby is apparently stillborn, Pari resuscitates the baby by saying "All is Well". Virus forgives Pari and his friends, gives Pari his treasured pen in gratitude and allows them to appear for the final semester examination. Pari eventually graduates as the "Most Outstanding Student" in his batch. After the convocation however, Pari disappears and goes into seclusion. 7 years later, Venkat and Senthil set out on a journey to Ooty to find Pari. They are joined by Srivatsan, who is now a wealthy and successful professional in the USA and is looking to seal a deal with a famous scientist and prospective business associate named Kosaksi Pasapugazh. Srivatsan\'s main intention in finding Pari is to find out whether Pari is more successful than him; they had made a bet 10 years ago on who would be more successful with their study approaches after Pari had humiliated him at a college function. However, when they find Pari\'s house in Ooty, they find a completely different man: the real Panchavan Parivendan . Confronting the real Pari, they find out from him that their friend was actually a destitute servant boy named Pappu. Pappu, who worked in Pari\'s household, loved learning, while Pari disliked studies. After seeing the boy\'s intelligence, Pari\'s father  agreed to allow Pappu study in Pari\'s place instead of working as a servant. In return, Pari would pocket Pappu\'s qualifications and after graduating, Pappu will cease all contact with Pari and his family. Pari reveals that Pappu is now a schoolteacher in Dhanushkodi. Later, Venkat and Senthil find out that as the fake Pari had disappeared, Ria had decided to marry her former boyfriend- a price obsessed banker whom she had dumped when the fake Pari made her realise that he loves his expensive items more than her. Venkat and Senthil rescue Ria from her wedding in Coimbatore and they along with Srivatsan drive to Dhanushkodi. At the fake Pari\'s school, Venkat and Senthil reunite with their long-lost friend, Ria and the fake Pari rekindle their romance, and Srivatsan mocks the fake Pari for becoming a lowly schoolteacher. He asks him to sign a "Declaration of Defeat" document for losing the bet. The fake Pari signs the document and when Srivatsan sees the signature, he is shocked to find out that the fake Pari\'s real name is actually Kosaksi Pasupugazh. Srivatsan accepts defeat and begs Kosaksi to sign the business deal, which the latter apparently refuses.'] ['The cartoon starts out with a whole bunch of flies buzzing around in a house, chilling out and having fun.'] ['The Pink Panther longs for a pet, but has not a dime to his name.

Very magical, he could fly as well as pass through small openings. While travelling through the air, the warlock found a studio where actors are making auditions while others are doing rehearsals. As he entered, he saw a lady chimp weeping. The warlock approached her and asked why she was crying. Speaking unintelligibly, the chimp told him she desperately wanted to sing at the audition and possibly make it to concerts. Unfortunately, her tongue was knotted, thus she couldn\'t even say a simple word. Feeling sorry for the chimp as well as falling in love with her, the warlock decides to help out. To assist his love interest, the warlock placed a turn table in the chimp\'s skirt where she will lipsync while the record plays the song. The chimp sets foot on the audition stage and performs her act although it wasn\'t a smooth one. The record repeated a line so many times and even slowed down. Nevertheless, the studio staff who were watching didn\'t seem to mind. When the record stopped in the middle of the song, the warlock secretly came to her aid and turns the phonograph\'s cluster. The song continues and the chimp was "singing" again. She even managed to do well on the final lines, much to the delight of those in attendance. As the chimp happily gets down from the stage, the overjoyed warlock decides to congratulate her with an embrace. Much to the warlock\'s surprise, however, the chimp sidesteps him and walks to the other guy standing behind. That other guy is none other than Oswald the Lucky Rabbit. Feeling insulted by this, the warlock grabs the chimp and takes her to a secret room within the studio. Upon reaching his secret place, the warlock decides to play the organ of the room. As he plays, he advised the chimp not to take off his mask. Curious of why she should not, the chimp opted to do so as she tiptoed towards the warlock. As she removes the mask of her captive, the chimp was surprised to find out that the warlock\'s face had no skin or flesh, and is therefore a skeleton in garments. Oswald somehow managed to locate the secret room and knocks on the door loudly. Disturbed by the noise, the warlock leaves the chimp inside and decides to confront the rabbit. Seeing the warlock fly toward him, Oswald ran away as quickly as he could. On his getaway, Oswald stumbled and falls into a hole. Upon landing into the bottom floor, the rabbit was bumped by a few large lizards that passed by. Oswald then thought his troubles were over but more still await as the warlock followed him there. Instead of tormenting the rabbit, the warlock chooses to just ask a riddle. He asked "What does the chicken say when it lays a square egg?" Not sure of an answer, Oswald gives up and admits not having any idea. The warlock then slaps Oswald in the face, causing the rabbit to say "Ouch!" The warlock also discloses to Oswald that "Ouch!" was the answer and he elatedly disappears. From there, nobody saw the warlock again.'] ['Two punks from the big city , traveling across the country in a Volkswagen bug, embrace the western ethos when they must take revenge against a group of rednecks for killing their friend ([[Flea  in this lighthearted road movie.

Years ago, Yusuf abandoned his son, İbrahim, in the courtyard of a university so that he could get a good education and become an important man. There, İbrahim was found by Father Hana, who raised him and gave him a good life. Now İbrahim has turned 30, and he returns to his village along with his girlfriend, Jessica. But will the tiny village of Tinne become the new home of İbrahim and Jessica? SYNOPSIS In a forgotten part of the Earth, in a deserted land in this forgotten part, is a simple and lonely village ‘Tinne’. Almost no one knows about its existence, except the beaming Sun maybe. This land is Tinne, that doesn’t even exist on the national map, that has no school, roadway or clinic. No dweller has identification paper over there. ‘Existence’ or ‘nonexistence’ is the one and only question. Its destiny may as well be the victim of its name’s definition in Kurdish language, which means ‘non-existent’. Tinne, a village abandoned to its own destiny in the middle of Mesopotamia, in the Southeast of Turkey, has been intentionally or unintentionally ‘forgotten’ by the government for years. Its inhabitants don’t even have any record in the civil registry. Neither Tinne, nor any of its people exist officially, whereas Yusuf Agha and its whole family have been living in this land for over a century. Even though Yusuf Agha constantly tries to get in touch with the government, he cannot get a reply to any of his letters. Hoping that his son will get a certificate of identification, he decides to leave his newborn son Ibrahim in the courtyard of the college while many others leave theirs in the mosque’s courtyard. Luckily, Priest Hanna who happens to pass by there comes to Ibrahim’s rescue. He adopts him so that he has identification, so that he exists, and by his existence, makes Tinne finally exist. Now-30-year-old Ibrahim returns to his homeland having finished his military service and graduated from college. He is enthusiastically and joyfully welcomed in the village. The only hope for Tinne, the village’s unique source of pride is back, bringing with him the chance for Tinne to start to exist, to become wealthy, to have a school, a roadway, a clinic and to become modern. However, Ibrahim’s heart is left in far away lands. Even though the facts that he received his college degree, that he finished his military service and that he is in love with a girl are greeted with happiness, this whole picture turns into a complete shock with Yusuf Agha hearing the girl’s name: Jessica. So, where is this Jessica from? What family does she belong to? Ibrahim answers: Colorado! The family is completely bewildered. Kolarado??? Ibrahim, while studying Fishery Engineering at the University of Çukurova, met Jessica who worked as an interpreter in America’s military base in Incirlik-Adana and he quickly fell in love with her. She became the reason of his life, so he did for her. They both had a hard time trying to convince their families. For Ibrahim’s family, it is a major issue to travel to the United States from Tinne, considering that they don’t even have identification cards. Finally, Jessica manages to take her father Christopher, her mother Pamela and her brother Danny to Tinne. This is the arrival of America to Tinne, which is not heard of, seen or known by the Turkish government. After this moment, everything becomes a reason for bewilderment and confusion, one after the other.

When an all-points bulletin is issued for her arrest, Kay drives her car into the bay, making the police believe that she is also a suicide victim. Some time later, in Hawaii, Kay pawns a unique piece of her jewelry, and Police Commissioner Blackton knows that she did not die. Not trusting the bumbling Homer\'s capacity to track Kay down, the commissioner contacts former policeman Sam Wye, a brilliant detective who specializes in finding, and romancing, women. Sam leaves his creditors and his fuming secretary Jean Livingstone behind and heads for Hawaii, accompanied by Homer. After charming some hairdressers, Sam discovers that Jean changed from blonde to brunette and sailed for Japan. Homer and Sam then search for Kay throughout the Orient. While Homer looks at tobacco shops asking if a woman has purchased Kay\'s special brand of Egyptian cigarettes, Sam goes to cafes trying to see if a woman has been playing Frédéric Chopin\'s "Andantino in A Flat Major," Kay\'s favorite melody, on the piano. When Homer thinks he has found the woman, it turns out to be Jean, who followed Sam to rekindle their old romance and collect a $100,000 reward now being offered by Bruhm\'s father. Jean also has a photo of Kay and the tip that she is travelling on a British passport as "Mary Holden." On a boat sailing toward Saigon, Sam finally meets Kay, and immediately falls in love with her. He doesn\'t let her know that he is a detective, and she falls in love with him as well. Now jealous as well as miffed over Sam\'s attempts to keep her from collecting part of the reward, Jean poses as a missionary\'s daughter and becomes friendly with Kay herself. She also helps Kay when she thinks that Sam secretly wired for the reward. Travelling from port to port, Jean, who is now very fond of Kay, helps her get away, then when Sam finds them again, she goes with them on a slow boat back to San Francisco after Kay decides that she no longer wants to be a fugitive. In order to help Kay avoid capture from rival police detective George Faulkner, Sam makes Faulkner believe that Jean is Kay, long enough for him to take Kay to a distant island. When Faulkner does track them down, Sam intends to shoot him, but Faulkner wounds him instead and Sam suddenly says that he has captured Kay for the reward. Back in San Francisco, the press calls Sam a "heel" for turning in his sweetheart, and even Homer and Jean, who have fallen in love with each other, think that Sam is a cad. After collecting the reward, Sam buys Bruhm\'s apartment and invites all of Bruhm\'s old girl friends to a party. During the party, he reveals to Homer that he has discovered that Kay\'s gun actually had blanks in it and thinks that Bruhm was killed from behind by a jealous lover. By rigging up a phony radio broadcast, Sam makes the real killer, Mr. Johnson, think that Kay has been found guilty of murder, and coerces him into confessing that he killed Bruhm for having an affair with Mrs. Johnson. Now free from the murder charge, Kay marries Sam, who finally has shaken his image as a cad.'] ["The film starts with God  meeting Abraham  to sell monotheism. After Abraham declines, God promises to end Abraham's theft problem by destroying the city of Sodom, where the thieves are coming from, within three days. Abraham asks God to get his nephew Lot  out of the city before he destroys it. God replays the command to his subordinates Raphael  and Michael . Lot runs a lottery stall and collects the proceeds toward building a cultural center for Sodom's children. Lot's wife  is a former pop singer whose career went downhill after she married Lot. They have a single daughter, Charlotte . Sodom is run by Bera the king of Sodom, a corrupt dictator surrounded by yes men, who has two sons—the elder and successful Ninveh  and the younger and stupid Liam . When Bera accidentally finds out that Sodom is about to be destroyed and Lot saved, he concocts a plan to switch places with Lot, as the archangels set to destroy the city had never actually seen Lot. He sends his elder son to seduce Charlotte, but to his chagrin his son falls in love. Bera tells Lot that he is ill and needs to get away from his usual surroundings, so they change places. As Lot takes the role of king, he becomes conceited and forgets his plans to help the children of Sodom. Bera finds out that Ninveh plans to betray him for the sake of Charlotte, and has Ninveh imprisoned. He instead decides to wed his younger son Liam to Charlotte. Ninveh escapes and crashes the wedding, telling the guests that there is no food, so they start to riot. He tells everyone that Sodom is about to be destroyed, and Lot and Bera make their escape with their families. On their way out they are met by Raphael and Michael, who would only let Lot pass, but both Lot and Bera pretend to be Lot. Lot's wife betrays her husband and supports Bera. The angels propose splitting Lot's wife in two as in Solomon's Judgement, but even though Lot cares more about her, they assume that Bera is in fact Lot, and let his escape with Lot's wife. Sodom is then blown up with dynamite, which Abraham witnesses and signs the contract with God. However, while it makes a big blast, no damage is done, and God tells his angels that it was a ploy to swindle Abraham into signing the contract. Bera brings Abraham the money from the wedding, and the latter accepts him into the family, while Lot remains to rule Sodom. It is shown that Sodom later moves to a more lucrative real estate location—Tel Aviv."] ["For their first day on the job as the new protectors of Metro City after defeating the deranged villain Titan, Megamind  and Minion  are selling off their gadgets from their evil lair to the citizens for good purposes .

Eva Wilt, his wife, is interested in the spiritual aspects of martial arts, Transcendental Meditation and similar pursuits. Eva\'s disdain for Henry\'s interest in reading adds to his general frustration at work, including being turned down for a promotion again, and leads him to occasionally fantasize about killing her. Her friends Sally and Hugh only exacerbate his alienation from her world by talking disparagingly about teaching as a profession and about his car. While he is walking home and speaking out one of his fantasies, he crosses paths with a botched sting operation by the incompetent Inspector Flint, whose wire has fallen off while trying to bust a drug dealer. Wilt intervenes in the resulting struggle and unknowingly helps the drug dealer to get away, thinking that he is witnessing a mugging. Soon afterward, a construction worker at the school sees a woman\'s body in a hole being filled with concrete. Meanwhile Henry Wilt has had to get a lift into work as apparently he had an accident in his car last night. Inspector Flint arrives at the school as they start work on digging out the body. Some papers are found at the hole where the body was seen, and a brief search identifies the writer of those papers as Henry Wilt. Evidence against Wilt mounts as he makes a phone call to his home from the police station and pretends the answerphone is his wife while Inspector Flint is present. During the interview, Wilt initially claims that he and his wife had an argument, and she disappeared and he has no idea where she is. Inspector Flint superficially accepts this explanation and tells him he can go, only to be confronted at the door by an old woman who claims to have seen him repeatedly stab a woman to death. Returning to the interview again, Wilt starts to go into more detail about the night of the party. It is revealed that at the party Henry and Eva argued as normal, and that Sally is sexually interested in Eva. While arguing with Sally, Henry managed to knock himself unconscious opening a door that turns out to be a cupboard. When he woke up, he was naked and tied to a blow-up sex doll. Eva walked in on him trying to burst the doll by writhing around, and also saw him appearing at a balcony above the disco in front of almost everyone at the party. After these incidents, Eva refused to return home with Henry. On the way home, Wilt found that the doll had been put on the back seat of his car; distracted, he crashed into a telephone box. Losing his temper, he pulled the doll out of the car and tried to burst it by stabbing it repeatedly, but failed. He was spotted doing this by the old lady who identifies him later at the police station. Wilt then headed to the school and dumped the doll down the same hole where the corpse was found. Back in the present, Inspector Flint follows the lead to Sally and Hugh\'s mansion, to find that they have also disappeared. They also find a knotted stocking at the scene, the signature of the notorious Swaffham Strangler. Flint takes Wilt down to the morgue where they claim to have found Eva\'s body, although it actually turns out to be another sex doll. It turns out that Flint is only on such an important case because Inspector Farmelow is on holiday, and that it is generally agreed that this is a chance for Flint to gain a promotion. The next day, they are preparing to bring up the body, much to Wilt\'s amusement. Unfortunately for the college, this coincides with the visit of a group of Japanese businessmen who are being courted to sponsor the college. The body, encased in concrete, is lifted out but slips free and is dropped onto the bonnet of a police car, freeing the blow-up doll, much to Inspector Flint\'s chagrin. Undaunted, Flint determines that the whole doll incident is just an attempt by Wilt to cover up the actual murders of Eva, Sally and Hugh. After many hours of interrogation, Wilt changes his story and starts telling Flint of his return to the mansion later the night of the party. He claims to have attacked the alleged victims with a chainsaw, and disposed of the bodies at the meat factory where many of the students work. Flint launches a search using massive amounts of manpower to find the evidence of this, before his superior points out that Wilt signed his confession "Sweeney Todd". Following this, Wilt is released, although his wife and her friends are still missing. Meanwhile, Eva has been stuck on a boat in the middle of a lake with Sally and Hugh, where Hugh finally tells her that Sally arranged the whole farce with the doll, intending to get Eva to split from her husband so that she would go on the trip and give Sally the opportunity to pursue her interest in her. Eva immediately leaves the boat using a small inflatable dinghy, and finds her way to a vicarage where she calls Wilt to get him to pick her up. She meets the vicar, who has apparently only recently moved to this location from Swaffham and happens to have a knotted stocking in his top pocket. Wilt hitchhikes to the village, just in time to find the vicar about to strangle Eva in the cemetery.

A giant chicken, about whom Tomoki apparently forgot, wreaks havoc on Sorami City, so Tomoki, via one of Ikaros' cards, has Sohara grown to giant size to fight the chicken, which she defeats, but then promptly steps on Tomoki for staring up her skirt. The film then switches to Daedalus who explains more about the Angeloids and their history, and then to a scene where an Angel is asleep in a pod. On Earth, Hiyori Kazane, a resident of Sorami City and the film's main heroine, introduces herself and explains how she met and fell in love with Tomoki, while also narrating about how she took part in several events from the two previous anime seasons, all the while observing Tomoki and his friends, and even becoming acquainted with most of them. After the recap, Hiyori decides she wants to be closer to Tomoki, so she asks to join the New World Discovery club, though Eishiro is against it, as he remembers seeing an Angel resembling Hiyori in Synapse  and is not yet sure what their reality is. He relents however, when Mikako mentions the clubs budget will increase with the new addition, which also means Tomoki must now fully participate in the club. Not happy with this, Tomoki decides to make Hiyori quit by subjecting her to various perverted, fake initiation tests, which Hiyori embarrassingly completes. Despite this, Hiyori's feelings for Tomoki remain unchanged and she is welcomed in to the club and participates in many activities with them, with even Tomoki accepting her presence and spending much time with her. This makes Sohara, Nymph, and Astraea believe they are dating, but wonder why, so Mikako suggests that Tomoki is blackmailing Hiyori. When the three girls confront Tomoki on this, Hiyori, who overheard everything, clears the misunderstanding and also confesses to Tomoki. Tomoki is left unsure of what to do, while Nymph and Ikaros understand that a relationship between Tomoki and Hiyori is impossible. In Synapse, Eishiro asks Daedalus about the relationship between Hiyori and the Angel that resembles her. When she does not answer, Eishiro mentions that when he first met Tomoki, he briefly forgot that they had met and asks if that is related to Synapse, to which Daedalus confirms. Eishiro decides to further investigate, while on Earth Tomoki goes to meet with Hiyori to give her a reply. On the way, Hiyori is run over by a truck and dies, causing her body to disappear and her existence to be erased from the memories of everyone not related to the Synapse. Realizing what is happening, Eishiro desperately runs to where the Angels in pods are but when he makes it he does not recognize the Hiyori in the pod. The Master of the Synapse appears and taunts Eishiro with his forgotten memories and mentions that Hiyori is awakening. Tomoki, unaware of Hiyori's fate, waits for her but when Nymph and Ikaros arrive, the former lies to him and tells him Hiyori will meet him tomorrow. To make up for her lying, Nymph spends the night with Tomoki and asks for the imprinting, but Tomoki explains that he wants her and the other angeloids to be free. Nymph says she wants to be imprinted because she is in love with Tomoki, but before she can convey her feelings Tomoki experiences severe headaches from the memory wipe, so Nymph holds him, knowing that by tomorrow Tomoki will have forgotten Hiyori. The next morning, Tomoki still clearly remembers Hiyori, while everyone else has forgotten her. Distraught, Tomoki runs over town searching for her, while in Synapse Hiyori is grief-stricken that her time on Earth has ended, so the Master of the Synapse offers her one more chance to see Tomoki. Tomoki confronts Ikaros and Nymph on what is happening, but Nymph explains they cannot tell him anything for fear of Tomoki learning that Hiyori is not the only part of his reality that isn't real. Tomoki collapses from the severe headache pain, so the two Angeloids including Astraea look after him. Nymph picks up something on her radar, so the three go to investigate, and find Hiyori. The reunion is cut short when, she is transformed into an Angeloid and is ordered by the Master of the Synapse to kill the three. Hiyori uses her ability of time manipulation to attack both Sorami City and the Angeloids, and easily overpowers the three. Nymph determines the only way to stop Hiyori is to kill her, though Ikaros objects, but Nymph reluctantly prepares to do so, until she is stopped by Tomoki, who swears to save Hiyori. The Master of the Synapse orders Hiyori to kill Tomoki, but Eishiro arrives to help, while the three Angeloids stall Hiyori. They manage to destroy the structure that binds her, but it does not free her. Nymph also realizes that the dimensional mechanism system that produces Hiyori's time altering powers has reached the breaking point causing a process that will result in the area around Hiyori, Sorami City, to be blown away. Unable to stop the process, Ikaros traps Hiyori within her Aegis to contain the blast, but also traps herself in since she does not want Hiyori to be alone in her final moments. Tomoki however hang glides to them and is let into the Aegis, where he is able to bring Hiyori back to her senses. Hiyori begs for them to get away as it won't be long before she self-destructs, so she uses her hacking abilities to dispel the Aegis, and kisses Tomoki before leaving. She thanks him and remembers how they met first met as children, and that it was because of him that she came to love Sorami City. She notes that while her time on Earth was short, she enjoyed her time with everyone and thanks her friends and Tomoki, and reaffirms her love for him before being destroyed. Tomoki breaks down in tears, and the film ends with him swearing that he will never forget Hiyori. Near the end of the credits, Sohara is seen viewing the scrapbook, filled with pictures of the group having fun. As Sohara leaves, a picture where Hiyori had faded away due to the Synapse's deletion, is seen where Hiyori slowly fades back in, revealing that she has somehow been revived. In a post-credits scene, Tomoki stands at the spot overlooking the city where he and Hiyori first met, and behind him a ray of light shines down with feathers falling from the sky, when he looks he smiles happily, and as the screen fades out, the sound of Hiyori's bell ornaments are heard, also, implying she was somehow revived."] ['This film is a farce about the romantic adventures of two young men with women of differing social backgrounds and the revelation of their true worth.http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/57833'] ['Kaan and Mete, co-hosts of a mid 1990s radio show called Kaybedenler Kulübü , struggle to deal with their daily lives after their show becomes an instant hit.

This delights the students, but after seeing that the hat is actually magic, the agitated Hinkle wants it back, which the children refuse to provide him with. Antagonized by both the children's dislike of his magic performance and the fact that he may not be given his top hat back, Professor Hinkle makes it his main priority to snatch the hat back from Frosty. The children and their snowman gleefully parade through town, shocking passersby with Frosty's anthropomorphism, and they are very happy with him, but the temperature is rising and Frosty must leave for somewhere that is colder or else he will melt. Karen, a little girl who is especially attached to Frosty, suggests that the group bring him to the North Pole, but they are barred from boarding a train that will take him there due to their lack of tickets. So, Karen and Frosty sneak into the back of a train delivering frozen goods, but Hinkle has also secretly managed to hitch a ride on the train as well in hopes of stealing back his hat, but falls off and is knocked cold. Needing to put as much distance between themselves and Hinkle as possible, they continue on toward the North Pole, accompanied by Hocus, who has chosen to side with them rather than Hinkle. While Frosty is safe from melting, Karen on the other hand is freezing and Hocus gathers with a group of woodland creatures to build a fire for her. Frosty knows that it is best if Karen is brought home, and he and Hocus decide to enlist the help of Santa Claus to transport her there. Hocus leaves to search for Santa while Frosty decides to take Karen to a greenhouse for warmth, but Hinkle has since come to and wants the hat back. He blows out Karen's fire and starts to pick a fight with Frosty who dodges and weaves. Being too slow for Hinkle, Frosty sees no other choice but to put Karen on his back and do a belly flop down to the bottom of the hill where a greenhouse lies. Following Karen in to make sure she is safe proves to be a lethal move for Frosty however. Hinkle has followed them on foot down the hill back to the greenhouse, and huffing and puffing, slams the door on the twosome, locking them inside, saying `As soon as Frosty melts, the hat will be mine!' In the meantime, Hocus manages to bring Santa back to the greenhouse to return Karen home. But when they return to the greenhouse for Frosty and Karen, they find her sobbing over a puddle of water with Frosty's top hat lying nearby. To console Karen, Santa tells her that Frosty was made of Christmas snow and can never melt away and will be back just as before, as soon as a crisp December wind kisses it. But Karen is still inconsolable, so to prove his point, Santa opens the door and a cold, strong gale blows through the greenhouse, revives Frosty. Karen is just about to put his hat on when Hinkle still declares that it's his and he wants it back. Santa on the other hand threatens to never deliver another present in all his life if he dares to harm Frosty in any way. Santa tells Hinkle that even if he wants a CHANCE for a Christmas present this year, as an act of penance, he must write a hundred zillion times, promising to never try to hurt the snowman again. Then Santa tells Hinkle that he'll find a new hat in his stocking on Christmas morning. Now joyful, Hinkle runs off to fulfill this order. Soon after, Santa takes Karen on a sleigh ride home and brings Frosty back to the North Pole, keeping his promise that he'll be back again someday."] ["In a suburb of Strasbourg, Alsace, France, ten year old boy, Max, spends his summer vacation with his grandmother.

This is frequently expressed in his famous catchphrase, "I want to become Caliph instead of the Caliph" , which has passed into everyday French for qualifying over-ambitious people who want to become chief. Iznogoud is always assisted in his plans by his faithful henchman, Dilat Larath . A typical example is when the Grand Vizier discovers the "Road to Nowhere", a road that only leads back to itself, and devises a plot to lure the Caliph there so he will become eternally trapped. In his excitement over the prospect to accomplish his life\'s mission, Iznogoud forgets that he needs an exit for himself. Another plan involves freezing the Caliph, which has to be shelved because there always seems to be some source of heat nearby. Iznogoud also attempts to enlist the services of a primitive computer  in order to find out the answer to his perennial ambition. The temperamental computer ends up sulking when Wa\'at Alahf answers a complex mathematical equation before it can. In the end, the only answer Iznogoud gets is the solution to the equation. As in every Iznogoud story, Iznogoud is ultimately unsuccessful, and the Caliph continues his reign.  Goscinny and Tabary occasionally make cameo appearances themselves. In one episode, Tabary uses a magical time-travelling closet to help Iznogoud seize the Caliph title. In another episode, Iznogoud gets a magical calendar that lets him travel in time when he rips off its pages. He rips too many and he is transported to the 20th century, inside the studio of Tabary. In another episode, Iznogoud gets a magical drawing paper set that makes anybody or anything drawn on it disappear once the paper is torn apart. Unfortunately, the drawing needs to be realistic, and Iznogoud is a poor artist. In search of an art teacher, he meets Tabary, renamed "Tabary El-Retard". There are occasionally "behind-the-scenes" moments, as when Iznogoud travels in a country in a mirror, and all is reversed, including text in balloons. Tabary is shown complaining to Goscinny about going through this frustrating "reversal" work, and even threatens him with a gun, to convince him into making a non-reversed "translated" version. They also appear debating after a contemporary crowd demands them to make Iznogoud caliph. Other recurring characters include Sultan Pullmankar , the Caliph\'s neighbour who is described as a touchy man with a powerful army. Iznogoud often tries to provoke Pullmankar to become angry at the Caliph, in order to instigate a war. However, Pullmankar never gets angry with the caliph, only with Iznogoud. The memorable pirates of Asterix  make a cameo appearance in the comic A Carrot for Iznogoud. A horse of the same name finished twelfth in the 2005 Grand National steeplechase at Aintree.'] ['Somebody is killing cheerleaders at a camp, and a Royal Canadian Mountie named Cooper tries to solve the case.'] ['Tjokkie Herington  and Crispin Wentzel  are watching a rugby match in a bar.

This short begins with Sam and Ralph enjoying breakfast  and walking to work. However, Sam appears far more bumbling while off duty in this short than in all the others, and he walks into trees on his way to work. Before the whistle blows, Sam falls off the end of his cliff, just barely catching the cliff with his foot. 1. As the whistle blows, Ralph is prepared to sprint toward the sheep, and even has a starting line drawn at his position. As he grabs a sheep and races back, Sam is climbing back onto his perch and unwittingly looses a rock on top of Ralph's head. Ralph races back to the position where he stole the sheep, puts it down, then races back to where the rock fell on his head, all while balancing the rock in position. Finally, he drops to the ground. 2. Ralph's next plan is to crawl under the grass of the field, lifting it like a carpet. After crawling under a sheep and trying to carry it away, Ralph is met with Sam, who has also crawled under the grass. Ralph attempts to run, but he's caught up in the grass, in much the same way as he was caught in the parachute in Ready, Woolen and Able. Sam punches Ralph and send him sliding to the edge of the grass, where his head sticks out and the bump on his head lifts the grass up further. 3. Ralph now decides to try using plate armour to protect himself from Sam. He fearlessly walks up to Sam and gives him a raspberry. Sam pulls Ralph out through his helmet by his tongue, then shoves him back through the helmet, upside down. Ralph walks away, frustrated and upside down. 4. Ralph takes the idea of using armour further and fashions a tank out of a cannon, some metal shielding, and a unicycle. It takes Ralph some time to get into position with the unwieldy unicycle, and almost falls off the cliff. Once he does get into position, Sam simply closes the flap over Ralph's gun, causing Ralph to blow himself up. Ralph circles around uncoordinated, and finally suffers gravity. 5. Ralph now attempts to burrow under Sam and deposit a reservoir of dynamite. After firing off the dynamite, the earth directly beneath Sam remains, while the circle of earth around him flies into the air. Naturally, one of the boulders lands on Ralph. 6. Ralph then notices a sheep drinking by the edge of the pond. He dons a full suit of diving gear and jumps off his own diving board made out of a plank and a rock. However, he doesn't jump forward enough and lands on the plank, which falls, sending the rock after it. Ralph and the plank land on another rock, creating a teeter totter, and when the falling rock lands on the other side Ralph is launched into the air and falls into Sam's arms. Ralph stands up and dives from there, falling head-first into the ground. Unfettered, Ralph swims through the earth with a front crawl. 7. Ralph finally decides to attempt every possible attack he can on Sam, all at once, and around Sam, he places a guillotine, two average sized cannons, two large cannons, an extremely large rocket, various melee weapons, and a series of gears under Ralph intends to pull the ground out from under him, dropping him into a pool of alligators, but before he can pull the master control switch, the punch clock whistle blows and he has to go home, so the two wish each other a good night."] ["Horaţiu  is an 8-year-old boy who still believes in Santa Claus.

The baggy-eyed rodent crawls out of bed, climbs the steps to the beacon, and yanks the plug out of the outlet to turn it off. Polly the parrot immediately flies into the lightkeeper’s bedroom squawking “Lights out! Lights out!” The lightkeeper wakes up shouting, “Grrrreat Scott! It’s that crrrrazy moose  again!” Consequently, a cargo carrier named Australia crashes into the rocks on the shore of the island, causing several wooden crates to spill overboard. The frustrated captain admonishes the lightkeeper to keep the beacon lit, and the lightkeeper and Polly apologize for the mishap. Hippety Hopper, a baby kangaroo intended for delivery to a city zoo, is inside one of the fallen crates, and after the ship departs, he hops off within the crate until it breaks apart against the rocks, setting him free. While all this is going on, Sylvester is downstairs sleeping. The lightkeeper abruptly wakes him up, rebuking, “While you sleep, that crrrrazy moose is loose in the hoose!” , then orders him to go upstairs to catch him and to "Hurrrry up, now, hurrrry up, now" . Sylvester tells Polly he can catch the mouse in a matter of seconds, and Polly starts counting the seconds. Hippety then hops into the lighthouse and follows Sylvester up the stairs. Sylvester sets a mousetrap and attaches a string. When he hears a snap, he pulls on the string and sees he has caught Hippety, whom he thinks is a giant mouse, which makes his jaw drop to the floor. Sylvester then shoots like a bullet down the stairs as Polly keeps counting , and dashes to the bathroom, thinking he must have “lighthouse eyes” or “stigmatism”. He puts in eyedrops, then, grabbing a bottle of vitamins, gulps them down and showers himself with them. Meanwhile, the mouse frees Hippety from the trap, and Hippety returns the favor by pulling the plug out of the wall.  Sylvester runs out of the bathroom, tells Polly “Keep counting, buster” , runs upstairs, puts the plug back in and pounds a few nails over it to prevent Hippety and the mouse from pulling it out again. He then prepares to knock Hippety out with a club and swings at him when he sees Hippety’s shadow approaching, but misses and sees that it is only the mouse wielding a mallet, which he uses to slam Sylvester’s foot. The mouse then zips behind the elevator door. Sylvester pounds on the door, and Hippety kicks him into the wall. Sylvester then sees Hippety and the mouse behind the door playing a back-and-forth switcheroo, making him think he must be hallucinating. Sylvester then charges back toward the elevator and Sylvester, Hippety and the mouse get into a scuffle, which ends with Hippety sending Sylvester tumbling down the stairs. By this time, Polly has counted more than 70,000 seconds , but the punch-drunk feline goes back for more, assuring Polly he will get the mouse “quicker than you can count up to Jack Robinson”. The mouse cuts the extension cord in two places with a pair of scissors, putting the lights out again, and the furious lightkeeper stalks Sylvester with a club threatening to “fix that good-fer-nothin’ pussycat”. In a panic, Sylvester attempts to reconnect the cord and gets a massive electric jolt, which turns the lights back on  and spares him a beating...for the moment. As Sylvester tapes the cord back together, the mouse rigs dynamite with the cord wrapped around it. It explodes, completely destroying the cord beyond any chance of repair. Immediately, the lightkeeper runs up the stairs and pummels Sylvester with the club. In the final scene, the lightkeeper is sleeping soundly, as are Hippety and the mouse, while Sylvester is serving as the beacon, hooked up to a battery with the light projecting through his eyes. To this, he laments, “I never thought just being a pussycat could be so complicated!”'] ['As he has in previous cartoons, Bugs is traveling underground, only this time he winds up in France at the headquarters of Napoleon Bonaparte, aptly called Headquartiers du Napoleon.

After a boring evening of watching television, including the reality show series, Tuff Gurlz, where a foul-mouthed woman  throws a used tampon at another for defecating in her food, and an episode of American Superstarz where a singer named Steven Clark  is cruelly humiliated by the judges for his horrible singing voice, Frank contemplates killing his rude and inconsiderate neighbors, whose screaming baby mixed in with his own insomnia and chronic migraine headaches give him a lack of peace in his own home. His ex-wife, Alison  has custody of their daughter, Ava , who has become a spoiled brat whose mother caters to her every whim. Making matters worse, he has just been fired from his job at an insurance company, after a failed attempt at being nice results in a sexual harassment complaint and violation of company privacy for looking up her address in the records.

Afterwards they kill several others, including a man who double-parks his car, zealous religious protestors who step on the rights of homosexuals and other religious and personal freedoms that America should stand for, and Michael Fuller , a popular but abrasive conservative political television commentator. After hearing about Steven Clark\'s attempt to kill himself apparently due to his infamy on American Superstarz garnering him a huge cult following and reappearance on Superstarz, Frank contemplates taking over the show. Frank then receives a call from his doctor telling him that there was an earlier mix-up with Frank\'s MRI results, and that his migraines are probably the result of simple stress and hypertension, rather than cancer. Elated that he\'s not dying, Frank decides to move to France with Roxy to avoid prosecution for the murders they\'ve committed. While eating in a diner with Roxy, Frank is propositioned by a pervert who mistakes Roxy for an underage prostitute and Frank as her pimp.

She receives a letter from her son Hans one day, informing her that he is engaged and wants to get married in his home town, and that he and his fiance Nicki will be visiting in the upcoming week. Having never heard or even seen a picture of Nicki, Katharina assumes that it\'s a female name and becomes elated at the thought of her son getting married and that she should one day become a grandmother, and in her excitement tells the whole town of Hans\' news, and soon the town is abuzz about the upcoming nuptials. When Hans and Nicki arrive at Katharina\'s doorstep however, Katharina is shocked to say the least. She has never had to deal with homosexuality before and isn\'t quite sure how to. She lets them in, but after a neighbor who sees Hans comes in asking where the bride to be is, Katharina tells her that Nicki is the best man, and that the bride is sick and stayed in Berlin. When the neighbor leaves, Hans argues with his mother which leads to Katharina kicking them out of her house. It\'s Hans\' dream to get married in his hometown however, so with Nicki\'s support they decide to stay and check in to a hotel until they can come up with a plan to bring Hans\' mother to her senses and still get married in Han\'s hometown. In the meantime, Hans shows Nicki around town, which leads to a local spotting the couple kissing while out on the lake. Soon news of Hans being gay becomes the talk of the town, and the prejudices of the citizens begins to show. When Hanz runs into his estranged father, Christian who is an auto dealer, he informs him of his homosexuality to which Christian doesn\'t react well and simply walks away. Christian tells his second wife Vera about Hans\' news, and she is shocked and then worried because Hans is about to open a second car dealership, and she is worried that his having a gay son will keep customers away. More obstacles come and go, Katharina\'s friends avoid her and she has been kicked off the church choir, and Christian\'s friends constantly make gay jokes behind his back and in front of him, and when Hans shows Nicki the place he wants to get married at, an old friend gets into a fight with him which leads to a large brawl in which almost everyone comes out bruised. This drives NIcki to give up and go back to Berlin. Things begin to look alright for Hans and his relationship with his parents however. Slowly they are beginning to accept him and his orientation. However they eventually get into another argument because they said that Hans was being unfair to them by never telling them about his homosexuality and then just showing up and expecting them to be 100% ok with everything. Soon after this, Hans also returns to Berlin, and they believe that it was because of that argument. However it soon comes out that Christian\'s second wife Vera, had been spreading a rumor that Hans was not Christian\'s biological son, and that he only ever said that he was to protect Katharina\'s honor. Hans had heard this rumor and this is what had driven him to leave. It is only sometime afterward at the opening of Christian\'s second auto dealership that he hears of the rumor, and makes an announcement telling everyone that despite what he had heard he is Hans\' birth father. He then goes to Katharina  and apologizes, telling her it was Vera who started the lie. Vera then begins arguing with them both. Furious, Kathrina punches Vera, and Katharina and Christian drive to Berlin together to talk to Christian. They meet and apologize for everything, and tell the couple that they have their support and that they would host a wedding for them. And they do indeed, getting everyone who previously were against them  to show up and give Hans the wedding he always wanted. The events of the film also brought Christian and Katharina back together again, so the ending is especially happy for Hans. The movie then ends with the very same church choir that temporarily kicked off Kathrina, giving a surprise performance of "All You Need Is Love" by The Beatles.'] ['Austin, Lawson, Michael, and Will are four college-aged Christians who have grown up in the bubble of Christianity.

Growing up during early 1980s in an upscale part of Belgrade as the only child in a well-off and respected nomenklatura family , he\'s an exemplary young man in his own right. Studying at the Faculty of Medicine while dating beautiful, smart, and similarly upwardly mobile Maša , the daughter of an influential communist Serbian politician father  and a free-spirited Slovenian mother , Slobodan\'s an attentive boyfriend and a considerate son. The opening scene has Slobodan listening to Russian bards and chansons on his stereo while respecting his parents\' orders as Maša and her parents are coming over for a visit. The two young lovebirds are having a traditional courtship, frequently socializing with the two sets of parents. Even when it comes to the young pair\'s sexual activity, Slobodan exercises restraint, insisting that the best place for sex is - a married couple\'s bed; Maša on the other hand is occasionally feeling adventurous, suggesting one night they do it in his yellow Volkswagen, the high school graduation gift from his parents. During the said sexual encounter, which Slobodan agrees to somewhat reluctantly, Maša informs him that on advice from her mother she placed an intrauterine device in her genitalia as a contraceptive. Driving around in his car one morning, Slobodan picks up a female hitchhiker who turns out to be a foreigner. Her name is Clavis and she\'s a French-speaking Swiss national from Zurich who\'s visiting Yugoslavia for a tour of Serbian medieval monasteries and frescoes. They hit it off in a playfully flirty conversation and arrange to meet again as he drops her off at Hotel Slavija. Satisfied with the turn of events, Slobodan drives off listening to Paraf\'s "Perspektiva". Another day he takes her to various museums; they discuss art, history, Leni Riefenstahl, Jean-Luc Godard, avant-garde, etc. followed by going up to her hotel room where she fellates him to Azra\'s "Iggy Pop". Out for a day at the Lido beach one afternoon with Maša and both their respective sets of parents, Slobodan has some tough explaining to do because Maša\'s friend saw him go in the hotel with the Swiss girl. Discovering a hickey on his neck serves as the ultimate proof of his infidelity for Maša and in a fit of anger she hits him on the head with a paddle. He losses consciousness momentarily, but when he comes to, with blood streaming down his face, dazed yet determined, he gets into Danube and swims across. Barefoot and disheveled with wet clothing, he impulsively runs all the way to Hotel Slavija in downtown Belgrade looking for Clavis, but is stopped and thrown out by the hotel security. Slobodan is now determined and ready for a major lifestyle change and marks this by going to the barber to get a haircut and shave off his bushy beard as Pekinška Patka\'s "Bolje da nosim kratku kosu" is playing in the shop. This is just the beginning of Slobodan\'s extreme behavioural turnaround as the blow to his head seems to have caused a major change inside it. He stops coming home in favour of hanging out and crashing at other people\'s dorm rooms at Studentski Grad student residence, all of which alarms his parents and Maša who report him missing to the police. Following a fight at the dorm he\'s reduced to spending the night in sleeping bag on benches at the train station. The police picks him up there, mistaking him for a petty criminal, and the inspector at the station calls his mother who comes to take him home. Once there, more antagonism awaits as his already agitated father completely losses it and gets physical upon seeing aloof Slobodan relieve himself in the bathroom sink with a devil-may-care attitude. Slobodan slaps him back with a stern and sarcastic: "Don\'t you ever do that again, daddy". The father throws him out of the house and on the way out Slobodan takes his own Volkswagen and drives off. His reckless behaviour continues as he shows up to Maša\'s apartment late one night, but gets informed by her mother that she went to Greece with her father for a holiday. Without missing a beat Slobodan puts the moves on his girlfriend\'s mother and soon ends up sleeping with her. The mature woman initially somewhat objects, but eventually submits herself gladly to the young man\'s physical advances. The next morning she makes him breakfast-in-bed, puts on a Bulat Okudzhava record, and initiates the "this can\'t continue" talk in motherly and patronizing tone to which he starts laughing hysterically before calling her a "menopausal whore whose daughter isn\'t much better" and leaving her angry and in tears. As he drives away, he pops in a tape in his car stereo with Šarlo Akrobata\'s "Niko kao ja" and starts masturbating before pulling over as he\'s about to climax. He soon sells the car in order to buy a motor bike. Slobodan is also getting into the new wave music scene, watching bands at SKC. At the Igra staklenih perli gig, he picks up Ljubica who takes him back to her place where he forces her into giving him fellatio by slapping her face several times as Prljavo kazalište\'s "Neka te ništa ne brine" is blasting on her stereo. After sex she makes a suggestion that he form a band and promises to put him in touch with some people. To that end she takes him to a hipster party - as they enter the private apartment where the party takes place, the live band VIS Idoli are playing "Schwüle über Europa" - and introduces him to Pit who likes Slobodan\'s lyrics.'] ['As Fibber McGee and Molly celebrate their 20th anniversary, they throw a large shindig, but everyone declines their invitation to the Silver Tip Lodge at Lake Arcadia.

Meanwhile, Bergen informs Jean of his disappointment when he discovers that the cocoons are too brittle to unweave. Soon after, Fibber arrives with a sample of the formula and the bad news about Wimple\'s discovery. In the rush of everything that is happening, Charlie accidentally spills the formula on the cocoons. To their delight, Jean and Bergen discover that the formula releases the silk threads. Returning to the lodge, Bergen, Jean, Charlie and Fibber learn that Molly has driven off in a carriage with Cadwalader.

One night, spoiled socialite Cornelia Bullock  offers him five dollars to be her "forgotten man" for a scavenger hunt. Annoyed, he advances on her, causing her to retreat and fall on a pile of ashes. She leaves in a fury, much to the glee of her younger sister, Irene . After talking with her, Godfrey finds her to be kind, if a bit scatter-brained. He offers to go with Irene to help her beat Cornelia. In the ballroom of the Waldorf-Ritz Hotel, Irene\'s long-suffering businessman father, Alexander Bullock , waits resignedly as his ditsy wife, Angelica , and her mooching "protégé" Carlo  play the frivolous game. Godfrey arrives and is "authenticated" by the scavenger hunt judge as a "forgotten man". He then addresses the idle rich, expressing his contempt for their antics. Irene is apologetic and offers him a job as the family butler, which he gratefully accepts. The next morning, Godfrey is shown what to do by the sardonic, wise-cracking maid, Molly , the only servant who has been able to put up with the antics of the family. She warns him that he is just the latest in a long line of butlers. Only slightly daunted, he proves to be surprisingly competent, although Cornelia still holds a sizeable grudge. On the other hand, Irene considers Godfrey to be her protégé, and is thrilled by his success. A complication arises when a guest, Tommy Gray , greets Godfrey familiarly as an old friend. Godfrey quickly ad-libs that he was Tommy\'s valet at school. Tommy plays along, mentioning Godfrey\'s non-existent wife and five children.

Godfrey explains that a broken love affair had left him considering suicide, but the optimistic, undaunted attitude of the men living at the dump rekindled his spirit. Meanwhile, when everything she does to make Godfrey\'s life miserable fails, Cornelia sneaks into his room and plants her pearl necklace under his mattress. She then calls the police to report her "missing" jewelry. To Cornelia\'s surprise, the pearls do not turn up, even when she suggests they check Godfrey\'s bed. Mr. Bullock realizes his daughter has orchestrated the whole thing and sees the policemen out.  The Bullocks then send their daughters off to Europe to get Irene away from Godfrey. When they return, Cornelia implies that she intends to seduce Godfrey. Worried, Irene stages a fainting spell and falls into Godfrey\'s arms. He carries her to her bed, but while searching for smelling salts, he realizes she\'s faking when he sees her  sit up briefly. In revenge, he puts her in the shower and turns on the cold water full blast. Far from quenching her attraction, this merely confirms her hopes: "Oh Godfrey, now I know you love me...You do or you wouldn\'t have lost your temper." When confronted by the rest of the family, Godfrey quits. But Mr. Bullock has more pressing concerns. He first has a private "little chat" with Carlo, throwing the freeloader out.

Later on, though, Irene tracks him down and bulldozes him into marriage, saying, "Stand still, Godfrey, it\'ll all be over in a minute."'] ['Rome, 1825.

Then, after appointing Bellachioma as the new Pasquino, he joins a convent to escape Rivarola\'s persecution. In the meantime, people from the streets assault Castel Sant\'Angelo, leading Montanari to believe that they are gonna revolt and set them free, but he soon learns that even his fellow citizens want them dead. The friar meets with Rivarola and asks him to delay the execution, believing that every soul must be saved, but the cardinal just shrugs him off. Eventually, the execution day comes and, just as the condemned are about step towards the guillotine, the friar shows up and desperately implores them to repent, but they politely refuse.

Meanwhile, an animator chooses to carry on with his work. In his drawing, he sketched a dungeon scene where Beans the Cat encounters a goblin. Weary for working several hours continuously, the animator decides to take a little snooze. Before ending the session, he draws a steel barricade between the two characters. Suddenly, the goblin comes to life and pulls him into the drawing. The goblin carries the animator away, heading somewhere beyond the picture's scene. Shocked and terrified, the animator tries in vain to break out of the goblin's grasp. He was then brought into a mystic chamber where stone portraits of various monsters are displayed on the walls. The monsters happened to be the animator's creations as well as those of his colleagues. They too came too life and got out of their illustrations. As revenge for how he and other cartoonists made them get subdued in the end of each film, the monsters gave the animator a pencil and forced him to draw a deep pit in the floor where they tossed him inside. Upon falling in, the animator holds onto a branch, trying to avoid being devoured by the crocodile at the bottom. Back at the scene still being worked on, Beans still stands behind the barricade, boredly waiting for his artist to come back. Just then, Little Kitty came to him, offering a lunchbox. Beans was expecting food but was a little surprised to find a saw in the container. Nonetheless, he uses it to cut his way out of the metal fence. Finally freeing himself, he goes around to find his animator. In no time, Beans found the chamber where his animator is being tormented. To intervene, he hurls a boot at the goblin, luring the monsters away as they try capture him. Beans managed to lose them somehow when he returns to the place to rescue the troubled man.

The monsters slide on the lubricant mess and fall into the hole. To vanquish them for good, the animator removes the hole with an eraser. Beans and the animator shook hands for a work well done.

The front wheels turn into a pair of hands, that manually squeeze the whistle in order to make a distinct honking sound. The scene then moves to a boxcar at the back of the train, where Bosko is singing and dancing, accompanied by a banjo playing pig. They are quite jolly until Bosko starts a mournful rendition of Cryin\' for the Carolines, at which the pig starts to cry. Suddenly Bosko and the pig are thrown towards the back of the boxcar. The pig seems to be out cold whilst Bosko looks around, trying to understand what is going on. Bosko tries to revive the pig but is unsuccessful. The scene pans to show that the train is climbing a hill, which explains the tilted boxcar. The train straightens itself at the top of the hill but then goes over a bridge, which bends exaggeratedly to accommodate its weight. Through a tunnel and then uphill again at almost a ninety degree angle, the train is now exhausted and starts panting as it begins to slow down. It then starts crawling like a giant caterpillar, curling and uncurling itself as it moves up the hill. Just a few feet from the summit, the train reaches out its wheels cum hands in an attempt to get a handhold but as it grabs the mountain, we see a part of the hillside peeling away and displaying spotted underwear. The mountain, using tree trunks as hands, reaches back and pulls up its pseudo-pants, looking quite angry as it does so. The train now begins to haul itself up using the railroad as a rope, manages to reach the top and goes over. However, the last boxcar breaks free and races back down the steep slope. Bosko lifts a small hatch in the roof and looks out frantically. His head gets knocked off by an overhanging sign and is left bouncing by itself on the roof. His headless body then climbs onto the roof and manages to reattach his head. Next the boxcar splits in two and Bosko is left with one foot on each side, balancing precariously over the speeding vehicle. Oddly enough, we do not see any sign of the banjo playing pig inside the split boxcar, which eventually comes back together. The boxcar continues to split and come together in this fashion several times. At one point, Bosko lengthens his neck, twists it into a winch of sorts and uses it to haul the boxcar pieces back together. The next tunnel is so low that Bosko gets thrown off the roof and tumbles down the outside of the tunnel, falling astride a cow at the other end. The cow starts galloping down the railtrack and Bosko gets thrown off as they enter another tunnel. He tumbles over it and ends up back on the roof of the boxcar which is now speeding along just behind the running cow. The boxcar goes over a bump and Bosko gets thrown off again, only to grab the edge of a pipe attached to the roof, which detaches from the side of the boxcar and drags Bosko along, bumping him hard against the ground. Bosko is then dragged through several trees and electricity poles when he eventually hits a bump in the road and gets thrown back onto the roof of the boxcar, which breaks and drops him inside. The cow sees a tree and comes to halt, causing the boxcar to flatten it against the tree. The cow then unravels itself, in the manner of an accordion and walks away, whilst pieces of the shattered boxcar rain down including Bosko and the pig, who fall onto a flat, open wagon. The pig opens an umbrella to shield them from the falling debris. When the pig finally puts his umbrella away, assuming that the debris has stopped falling, one last piece falls directly on his head. This gives him a large bump and he starts to cry. Bosko dries his tears and pushes off down the track on the little wagon. He starts playing the banjo and singing as the pig cheers up and starts to sing along with him. They disappear into a tunnel as we see the closing credits.'] ['Ethan Morgan  is a geeky freshman, not trusted by his parents to stay home alone with his little sister Jane.

In another vision, Ethan sees that Jesse is Horace Black, and plans to use the box to trap the souls of teens going to see a movie premiere to resurrect the souls of his ancient cult during the lunar eclipse occurring on that same night. Benny\'s grandmother, who reveals that she is an Earth Priestess, gives Ethan, Benny and Sarah enchanted daggers and a spellbook to defeat the vampires.

At the theater, the vampires begin to steal the souls of the teens, but are thwarted by Ethan, Benny and Sarah. Jesse escapes and Ethan and Benny follow in pursuit. In another vision, Ethan sees the tree he saw inside the old book, realizing it\'s the tree in his backyard, where they find Jesse. As the eclipse begins, Jesse attempts to hold Ethan and Benny down and resurrect the souls he already obtained from the Cubile Animus, but Sarah intervenes. When the box lands in Ethan\'s hands, he releases the vengeful souls that were captured, and they destroy Jesse. The next day, Ethan, Benny and Sarah head to school, meeting Erica and Rory, who have decided to live peacefully as vampires.'] ['In the opening scene, secret agent Rock Slag  is being chased through Bedrock.

As the shelling comes to a stop, the fish wipes sweat from his brow, only to have a program called "Gangsta Busters" begin playing including the sounds of bombing and gunfire, and goes through all the motions again until he is bounced off the ocean floor which causes the radio to be up-chucked. Bowls and boxes are the next to follow, forming a hotel with a ballroom inside. Two electric eels swim by and form the marquee "Holly" and "wood" above the entrance and begin blinking on and off. Two other fish enter with flashlights on forming spotlights, as seen in front of hotels and theaters with big events and movie premiers in Hollywood that were common at the time. Two other fish have bowler hats drop on them, and as they turn toward the camera, acquire a likeness of Laurel and Hardy, and they swim into the Hotel. Another fish steps into some large shoes, and impersonates a Greta Garbo character and she says, "I want to be alone", a line in the 1932 classic Garbo movie "Grand Hotel". Another fish swallows an hourglass lamp and takes on the likeness of Mae West, complete with jewels and parasol, utters, "Come up and see me sometime" as she steps into the Hollywood Legion Stadium to watch a boxing match. There are two boxing fish fighting on the keys of a typewriter in the stadium, and as the carriage comes to the end of the line, the typewriter\'s ding is heard, and each fish backs into his own corner, and another fish pushes the carriage back to the beginning of a new line. The keys spell out what is happening in the fight. Back to Porky, he\'s now frowning because all of his goods have been lost, and puts a worm on a hook and lowers it into the water. The sentry fish sees this and pulls out his own fishing pole with baited hook and the worm jumps onto the hook and the sentry fish reels him in and eats him! Later, the ballroom guests are partying and waving their drinking glasses around when a spotlight appears on the curtain. As the curtain rises, we see some pretty dancing legs and as the curtain rises further, it turns out to be a 10-legged octopus! The Mae West fish dances with something resembling a walrus or seal; her bustline and his waistline fit together perfectly as they dance. The fish that swallowed the clock stands still as his hips move to the beat of the music. A whale appears under Porky\'s boat and the sentry fish knocks on the hole cover. As Porky opens the cover and says, "Who\'s there?" the whale spouts water from his blowhole, which forces Porky back onto the boat. A waterspout appears in the moonlit evening sky and as we see the dancing fish again, the announcer comes on and says there\'s a waterspout approaching the Boola-Boola islands. The fish casually go back to their dancing until he says, "Well, come on you guys, SCRAM!" and all of the fish panic and run for their lives. The force of the waterspout picks up all of the goods and drops them back into the Petunia, and Porky sails off into the distance. The sentry fish spits water, and Porky comes back and sprays him with a spritzer-bottle, and the fish starts crying and the cartoon comes to a close.'] ["Cheran  and Pandiyan are stepbrothers who are constantly at loggerheads and their daughters Manjuand Anju continue their enmity.

Bugs famously declares he "shoulda make a left toin at Albuqoique". As he asks the matador for directions, the matador escapes into the stands, leaving Bugs to fend for himself against Toro. After irritating Bugs and getting a slap for "steaming up my tail," Toro chalks up the points of his horns like a pool cue and rams the rabbit out of the bullring. As he sails into the air, Bugs mutters his famous line from Groucho Marx: "Of course you realize, dis means war". Toro takes his applause for claiming his latest victim , but it is short-lived because Bugs re-enters the bullring in matador garb. Bugs defeats Toro using an anvil hidden behind his cape. While Toro is still dazed from his collision, Bugs makes the bull follow the cape up to a bull shield, accompanied by a lively underscore of "La Cucaracha", where his horns pierce it. Bugs bends the horns down like nails and, thinking he\'s got him at bay, makes fun of Toro using puns . Unaware that the bull can detach his horns and strike back, Toro proceeds to bash Bugs in the head, which knocks him unconscious. While Toro sharpens his horns, Bugs interrupts him by placing an elastic band around the horns and using it as a giant slingshot to smack him in the face with a boulder. Toro charges back at Bugs, right in the buttocks. Bugs then returns, this time in a large sombrero doing a little dance and slapping Toro on the face in tempo to the tune of "Las Chiapanecas". Toro tries to punch him twice but is slapped each time. Bugs dances more and then disappears under the sombrero, but not before honking Toro\'s nose. While Toro once again sharpens his horns , Bugs has prepared a booby trap for the bull, composed of a double-barreled shotgun hidden behind the cape. Toro charges towards the cape, and somehow the shotgun previously in Bugs\'s hand enters Toro\'s body and stops at his tail, firing a bullet from one of Toro\'s horns when he flicks his tail  on the ground. Now having the upper hand, Toro chases Bugs shooting at the hare, but Toro eventually runs out of bullets. Toro "reloads" by swallowing several "elephant bullets" , but when he attempts to test-fire he instead explodes, gun and all. Bugs taunts Toro once again by calling him, among other things, an "imbecile"  and an "ultra maroon," but realizes that he is cornered by the bull behind barred gates. Awaiting certain death , Bugs miraculously opens the gates like a garage door, sending Toro out of the bullring and into the horizon. Toro runs back to the bullring, not anticipating that Bugs has laid out a Rube Goldberg–like contraption of axle grease, a ramp, and some platforms on the bull\'s path. The grease and ramp send Toro airborne over some glue, a sheet of sandpaper, a protruding matchstick, and a barrel of TNT which explodes when Toro flies by. Still in the air and in shock, Toro finally crashes into a wooden bull shield. The cartoon ends with the unconscious bull\'s hindquarters sticking out of the shield, and the victorious Bugs holding up the cape with the words "THE END" etched on it.'] ["Three buddies  steal a luxury car, landing them into a whole lot of trouble with everyone they meet, including a brutal killer, one of the friends' former wife and a gorgeous women  who seems death-proof.x3 TroubleThe Straits Times"] ['A bather (played by Willy Mullens, A policeman is not appreciative and trouble grows, witnessed by a growing crowd.

Its upbeat and modern approach, good clothes, good looking people and great locales, make it a multiplex winner — a formula Sandalwood’s young brigade has adopted. The film is about two youngsters, both of whom are quite the ideal children. Imagine a girl who makes a guy wait hoping to get her parents to approve his proposal; or a guy who says, “I’ve met the girls parents, I see them in her eyes”. These are the stuff most of the typical families dream of, as they plan their kids’ futures. The film has its funny moments and occasionally, an overdose of sentimental scenes. The director has done a fairly decent job with the narrative and Yash impresses in his role as the lovelorn urban lad. His dancing skills deserve special mention — he’s easily one of the best we have in Sandalwood. New girl Bhama makes a decent debut, though Deepu, who has dubbed for her, deserves equal applause. Rangayana Raghu and Tara excel, the film shows Raghu in a different light, as opposed to his over-the-top comical roles.'] ['In the desert, Woody Woodpecker, riding a horse, is gaily strumming a guitar and singing a song of loot long lost.

Their possessions, however, escaped unharmed but falls over Coyote, just as he was about to catch Road Runner, causing considerable pain to him . Coyote notices the ACME book of magic and becomes delightfully happy, as he now has a new weapon against the Road Runner. * 1: The first spell that Coyote tries is to turn the black cat into a feral beast. He succeeds, and the cat transforms into a black panther, but unfortunately, his beast proved to be too feral, and it quickly slices his belly into strips, fading Coyote like a balloon. * 2: Coyote buy an ACME flying broomstick and, after some trial and error, begins to chase the Road Runner through air. However when he enter in a gloomy tunnel, Coyote mistakes his beeps  with a horn of an approaching truck and suddenly changes his direction to the sky, only to be hit by two comets and get his broom "out of gas". After a long drop, Coyote manages to stop his broomstick in the middle of air and lands safely, only to the Road Runner scare him from his back with his beeps off a cliff and leaving the poor Coyote to suffer gravity. * 3: In his second spell, Coyote tries to turn himself in a giant, but much to his chagrin, the spell only affects his head, whose weight crushes his own body. * 4: Coyote uses invisible ink to make a bomb transparent and disguise it like a crystal ball in order lure a unsuspecting Road Runner to his death. However, the fake crystal ball actually works and the Road Runner sees Coyote\'s future where he\'s caught in middle of a huge explosion...a future that quickly turns into reality when the bomb rolls straight to him. * 5: In his third spell, Coyote learns levitation and uses his classical "seeds trap" to temporarily stop the Road Runner and smash him with a large rock. Unfortunately, the rock doesn\'t fall under his command, giving enough time for the Road Runner to finish his lunch and leave. After several unsuccessful attempts to makes the rock fall, Coyote leaves in disgust, only for the rock to follow and crush him. * 6: In his last spell, Coyote once again tries to shape shift the cat into another creature, and this time, into a pegasus to once again chase the Road Runner though air, but they inadvertently fly trough a load of poisonous snakes , and to make matters worse, the pegasus quickly turns into a flying carpet, and much to Coyote\'s anguish, they fly straight to a reserve of scorpions and to a field of cacti. The carpet is then turned into a monitor lizard , a lawnmower, and then into a white shark, and he and the Coyote land in a lake where the Coyote is viciously mauled by his familiar. It\'s turned out that the reason of the cat\'s uncontrollable transformations were Road Runner\'s fault, who found the book of magic and decided to test his powers. He then turns a mailbox into a gracious and beautiful female roadrunner and the two leave, walking and holding "hands", while the Coyote suffers being shark food. This Coyote and Roadrunner short is notable for being the only one so far to use the real taxonomic names Geococcyx californianus  and Canis latrans  instead of the usual pseudo-Latin names.'] ['Like many who grew up in the 1980s, John Tavish enjoyed the music of rock legend Roxy La Che.

Chicago wakes up in the man\'s home and the man introduces himself as Julius Ho , a 75-year-old martial arts expert. Chicago tells Julius that he\'s trying to find Pretty-Eyed Willy, but Julius tells Chicago that Pretty Eyed Willy is not easy to defeat because he once trained him and Pretty-Eyed Willy used his moves for evil things, including trying to kill Julius.

And no matter how much he eats, he never fills up.    When his mother leaves a pair of pies out to cool, Piggy swipes a pie from the windowsill and spins it around his finger as he eats it; he tries to eat a second pie in the same manner, but his mother catches him in time and he accidentally chomps on his bare fingers. That afternoon, his mother serves spaghetti for dinner. While the family says grace, he ties all of their spaghetti strands together, so that he can devour all the spaghetti  in a single slurp! His mother scolds him, but he clearly doesn\'t care. As the other pigs sleep, he is awake, in deep thought of food. The next morning, he finds himself invited into the home of a kindly, hiccuping old man . The old man asks Piggy if he is hungry and presents Piggy with a table laid out with a full-blown feast – complete with a roasted turkey. Overjoyed at the man\'s generosity, Piggy sits down, rubbing his belly in anticipation. At that moment the man shoves the table of food out of Piggy\'s reach as the cover of the chair is pulled out from under him. A leather belt across his arms and chest straps him in place as a robotic arm swings around to take hold of his nose. The man shows himself to be some sort of mad scientist declaring, "So, it\'s food you want!? Ha, ha!  We\'ll give you plenty of it!" The scene switches to the basement, revealing the Feed-A-Matic—a bizarre machine built for the sole purpose of force-feeding hungry little kids like Piggy . The scientist rushes down to activate the controls, yelling, "So, you love food,  eh?", and goes straight to his work. The chair Piggy is strapped into first carries him to a huge vat  filling with gallons of soup from cans; the mechanical arm then pulls on Piggy\'s nose forcing his mouth open to let in a torrent of soup through a feeder shaped like a Pelton wheel but with spoons as buckets. He is then fed bananas popped out of their skins down his throat like bullets. Next to follow are stops at a gumball machine that doles out olives and at a conveyor belt of ice cream cones dispensing ice cream via a bellows. Then comes the main course, a sandwich as big as a king-sized bed , followed by dessert dispensed from the "PIE-A-TROPE" -- pies spinning on the spindle of a converted jukebox. Laughing maniacally, the scientist—in various montages--incessantly continues forcing food into Piggy. After an entire day of the business, the pig is returned from the basement up to the mad scientist\'s living room, transformed into an extremely obese, food-packed ball. Bulging out of the restraints, Piggy is utterly happy. Smiling at the sight of Piggy’s extreme obesity, the scientist prods his fat twice and kindly asks "Have enough, my boy?" To which Piggy replies "Y-y-y-yes sir!" The doctor then unstraps him commenting, "Why, you\'re not half full!" With the sun setting, Piggy waddled his bloated way to the door, passing by the food the scientist had laid out on the kitchen table to bait him . Looking at the turkey he delights at the prospect of more food. He pulls off a drumstick, and after taking a bite, explodes. Or rather, he wakes up screaming in his own bed – it was just a dream. Then hearing the sound of his mother calling him to breakfast, he dashes downstairs and starts eating again with gusto.'] ["Balettan  is a bank accountant who is known well for his help to the whole village he is living in.

The patrons yell &#34;Hi Bosko&#34; in return as Bosko laughs uneasily. He then picks up his bullet ridden hat and walks inside where a three-piece band, comprising banjo, violin and piano, is playing &#34;She&#39;ll be coming round the mountain&#34;. Bosko starts to tap dance whilst some onlookers sway to the beat. The piano player thumps hard on the keys which makes a mug of beer fly through the air and empty the contents into his open mouth. He gulps it down and is suddenly consumed by flames that spread upwards from his feet. This results in his clothes being burnt off, exposing bloomers. He puckers a suddenly lipsticked mouth, crosses his knees in a shyly feminine fashion and walks away seductively. Bosko steps up to the piano and starts to play, rocking his stool in tune to the music. Next, four cards are seen held in someone&#39;s hand: a King, Jack, Queen and Joker. They sing a little ditty but the person holding the cards soon shoots the Joker putting an end to their performance. Bosko is shown still playing the piano whilst the other patrons gather in a circle and start dancing. The scene then cuts to show the following words The Deadwood stage &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Honey  is in a carriage that is hurtling down the highway with a big trunk on the roof. The ride is quite bumpy so Honey gets thrown around her seat a bit and exhorts the driver to be careful. A group of highwaymen are also on the move and one of them creep along behind a cliff to look for potential prey. He spots Honey&#39;s carriage and hastens back to his cronies who follow his lead. He then positions himself alongside the path of Honey&#39;s carriage and aims his guns. However, the carriage hurtles past at such a fast pace that the gunmen gets twisted around himself. Having unravelled he gets on his horse and gives chase along with his gang, all of them shooting non-stop. Eventually, the trunk on the roof of the carriage falls out and the clothes get out and start running away to avoid the hailstorm of bullets. A corset is seen literally &#39;flying&#39; away. Inside the carriage Honey is getting thrown about violently as the driver is flung off his perch and lands on a tall cactus. He slides down wincing as hundreds of thorns break off and lands on a skeleton of a bull. The skeleton suddenly comes to life and goes off at a gallop whilst the rider hangs on for dear life. Back at the saloon, Bosko is still playing the piano when the driver stumbles in and relays the news. He then deflates and collapses dramatically into his pants as his hand grabs a mug of beer and pours it in after himself. Bosko gets on his horse and gallops away to the rescue, the horse leaping noticeably effortlessly over the rocks he seemed to have trouble with earlier. The bandits are still chasing the carriage and Honey leans out of a window and implores Bosko to save her. As Bosko continues to gallop after the run away carriage the scene pans out to show Hugh Harman, Rudolf Ising and one other person watching the cartoon and adding sound effects. They discuss how they can get Bosko to save the girl, when someone says &#34;Let&#39;s go home&#34;. This prompts everyone to exit, leaving Bosko in the lurch.'] ["The film follows the adventures of Little Red Riding Hood  and Tom Thumb  and their friends, fighting against the wicked Witch Queen  and her band of monsters.

Guido engineers further meetings with her, seizing on coincidental incidents to declare his affection for her, and finally wins her over. He steals her from her engagement party on a horse, humiliating her fiance and mother. Soon they are married and have a son, Giosuè . Through the first part, the movie depicts the changing political climate in Italy: Guido frequently imitates Nazi party members, skewering their racist logic and pseudoscientific reasoning . However, the growing racist wave is also evident: the horse Guido steals Dora away on has been painted green and covered in antisemitic insults. In 1945, after Dora and her mother  are reconciled, Guido, his Uncle Eliseo and Giosuè are seized on Giosuè's birthday, forced onto a train and taken to a concentration camp. Despite being a non-Jew, Dora demands to be on the same train to join her family. In the camp, Guido hides their true situation from his son, convincing him that the camp is a complicated game in which Giosuè must perform the tasks Guido gives him, earning him points; the first team to reach one thousand points will win a tank. He tells him that if he cries, complains that he wants his mother, or says that he is hungry, he will lose points, while quiet boys who hide from the camp guards earn extra points. Guido uses this game to explain features of the concentration camp that would otherwise be scary for a young child: the guards are mean only because they want the tank for themselves; the dwindling numbers of children  are only hiding in order to score more points than Giosuè so they can win the game. He puts off Giosuè's requests to end the game and return home by convincing him that they are in the lead for the tank, and need only wait a short while before they can return home with their tank. Despite being surrounded by the misery, sickness and death at the camp, Giosuè does not question this fiction because of his father's convincing performance and his own innocence.

Guido tries to find Dora, but is caught and executed by a Nazi soldier.

One day, as Don scurries across a kitchen floor, he is suddenly crushed by a foot. The narrator Gilliam remarks that this does not matter, as cockroaches are not very interesting.

In the show, he pulls a rabbit out of his hat (actually [[Woodstock , then does a ring trick that\'s goes a bit wrong. Both of these tricks raise the ire of one heckler who demands their money back and doesn\'t see the humor the others see, but Snoopy quickly shuts him up both times. He also does the "stick-in-the-hole" trick to Franklin , the "amputation-decapitation" trick to Peppermint Patty, cutting Linus\'s trademark security blanket into strips , the "levitation" trick to Lucy van Pelt, and biggest of all, making Charlie Brown literally disappear. Unfortunately, a sudden rainstorm ends the show early, and Charlie Brown is left invisible. Convinced he is going to remain that way for the rest of his life, he prepares to "roam the world as a lost soul", and Sally begins moving her stuff into his room. Before Charlie starts roaming, he decides to feed Snoopy to show him what has happened. When Snoopy realizes he cannot yet reverse the trick, he tries a couple of different ideas to make Charlie Brown somewhat visible again, including draping a sheet over his head, which scares Sally, and causes Charlie Brown to faint when he sees himself in the mirror. Despite this shortcoming, Charlie Brown realizes he has a golden opportunity to kick Lucy\'s infamous football without her usual prank of pulling it away at the last second. Taking advantage of his invisibility, Charlie Brown finally kicks the ball out of a bewildered Lucy\'s hand and then taunts her about it. Furious that Charlie Brown seems to have gotten the upper-hand, Lucy demands that Snoopy find a way to turn him back, threatening to \'clobber him.\' Snoopy studies the book, and after testing a number of counterspells on Woodstock , he goes about casting his counterspell in all directions, unsure just where Charlie Brown is. As Snoopy wanders into a vicinity where Lucy is setting up another place-kick, Charlie Brown happens to run by where Snoopy is practicing. Just as he is about to kick the ball again, Snoopy casts the counterspell in Charlie Brown\'s direction, causing him to unknowingly become visible again. Lucy witnesses his reappearance and pulls the ball away for the 11th time as Charlie Brown winds up to kick it. He then lands on his back. Nevertheless, Charlie Brown is happy that he finally kicked the ball, though Lucy considers this a false statement, saying no one will believe him. When Lucy scoffs at Snoopy\'s magic abilities, the insulted beagle magically levitates Lucy into the sky like he levitated her during that magic show earlier, and leaves her stuck there as payback. Snoopy and Charlie Brown happily laugh and dance away to conclude a satisfying day, while Linus eventually pulls Lucy down with his blanket during the closing credits.'] ['Douglas "Dawg" Munford  is the ultimate womanizer: He is selfish, rude and totally uncaring about what a woman thinks after they have sex.

When his son Rangachari  goes on a mission to research on Tughluq, he finds a buried coffin that contains Thugluq , and his accomplice Ibn Batuta alive inside. They claim that they are the true Thugluq and Batuta buried several centuries ago along with a herb that has protected them and kept them alive until 1968 A.D.  Thugluq becomes a national sensation and is welcomed in all grandeur to Rangachari\'s house. He is interviewed by many newspaper journalists to whom he answers in a very sarcastic attitude.

He decides to contest in elections to become the Prime Minister of India. In his good faith, Thanikachalam, an old freedom fighter, and his daughter Gandhimadhi ([[Manorama  volunteer to help taking part in his political rallies.

A total of 450 people join his party and all of them are made Deputy Prime Ministers. At the news being announced at radio the masses become very happy. A few people  even go as far as wagering and jumping with joy. The Rangachari family also become very overwhelmed at it. Thugluq appoints the naive Gandhimadhi as one of his ministers.

This letter is now the only evidence to reveal Thugluq\'s true colours. However, Gandhimadhi, now knowing the ways of the world, refuses to hand over the letter because, if she does even she will be in trouble for supporting both of them.

Sam welcomes Bugs into his home, anxious to receive the one million pounds. Bugs plays the role of an annoying house guest, presumably to test Sam, this naturally provokes Yosemite Sam to lose his temper and losing more money. Bugs asks Sam for multiple items at dinner.

First, he saws a hole in the floor outside the bathroom door and tries to get Bugs to come out by telling him somebody wants to see him, but Bugs orders Sam to tell whoever it is to come back the next day as he\'ll be in the bathroom all day. This makes Sam mad enough to bust into the bathroom and push Bugs out, only to fall through the hole intended for Bugs and land in the river below and the gibberish, "perka-shorka-bat-flattin\'-port\xadin-filabunkabertin\', perkalooma burtin\' dirtin\' boostinattin\' bartin\' anatom" curse while falling. When Sam returns and Bugs tells him he\'s done with the bathroom, Sam rushes at him to strangle him, but falls through the hole and into the river again, again cursing the entire way down. Later, Bugs climbs up a really long staircase . At the top, Sam, dressed in a suit of armor, tries to chop off Bugs\' head with a double-bladed axe, but Bugs ducks and he falls down the stairs. While falling down the stairs, Sam continues to rant, curse and rave, and Bugs continues the deductions . Finally, the next day, Sam gets control of his temper.

Her father just can’t tolelate any other guy looking at his daughter face to face. He can not accept anybody who tries to be friend with his daughter. He terrifies, beats everybody to protect his daughter. Subhashree in the films also loves her dad but at the same time dreams about someone capable enough to challenge her dad. Who can really fight her dad for Subhashree. Here comes our hero Dev to save and love Subhashree. Challenge is definitely a love story but “action” dominates everything else. In the fear of Pooja's boyfriend, her father sends her to his father-in-law's home. But at last the couples gets married and after some years they had a son. The plot of Challenge is not an original piece of work but the smart treatment does make it engaging. At the centre of the knotty affair is Rajatava, the baap of local goondas who is obsessed with the need to shield his daughter Subhashree from male gaze. Rajatava’s men bully every boy who dares look at her, but Cupid strikes when Dev-Subhashree meet and the hero takes on the father’s might with brain and brawn. Despite the theme, which could have easily spiralled into the usual Tolly ordeal of sound and fury, Raj keeps the tenor breezy with music, humour and cute romance. Somak Mukherjee’s cinematography helps do the trick for Raj. Challenge belongs to Dev. He does set hearts aflutter. He looks good, dances well and carries off the angry young man attitude with panache. And yes, he can act too. Subhashree, sweet and sassy, plays Miss Touch-me-not with poise but a little more effort would have helped her match up to her suave and spunky hero. Rajatava looks a tad different from his other villainous roles as the story prevents him from going into the routine blood-and-gore nautanki. As the funny college principal, Kharaj is loud and theatrical but he fits into the scheme of things to make you laugh.

On the way they pass Asterix and Obelix whose fishing is not doing well and Lucullus taunts them. The heroes give chase using Obelix as an outboard motor, but he is diverted by the aroma of food from the passing pirate ship, and then blown off course by a violent storm. After a long pursuit, when they\'ve nearly lost hope, a dolphin brings Dogmatix  and guides them to the Romans.

A skeptical Kyle is there, having made a bet that if Cartman can prove leprechauns exist, Kyle will suck Cartman\'s balls, but if not, Cartman will owe Kyle $10. To Kyle\'s shock, they do spot a leprechaun and give chase. They eventually and successfully catch it in a trap. The leprechaun says he was sent to warn of a terrorist attack, and that being chased by the boys has made him late, before vanishing. A triumphant Cartman declares that Kyle must now suck his balls, but Kyle initially refuses, asking why a leprechaun would be warning of a terrorist attack and insisting that there has to be a logical explanation. The next day, as Kyle is conversing with Stan, Kenny, Jimmy and Butters, a strange man suddenly appears, asking them if they have seen the leprechaun. When Kyle argues that leprechauns are just imaginary, the man tells him that just because something is imaginary doesn\'t mean it is not real. He then invites the boys for a ride in his magical "Imagination Flying Machine" while he serenades them with "The Imagination Song" . The group arrives in a place called Imaginationland, where all the beings created by human imagination reside. The imaginary creatures are all fascinated by the presence of "creators", and ask them about the leprechaun. At that moment a band of Islamist terrorists suddenly appear and set off a series of bombs, which kill hundreds of the imaginary creatures and destroy most of the city, with Stan watching . The boys flee on the back of Draco who flies them to safety. Butters, however, gets left behind, and he and the surviving imaginary characters are taken hostage by the terrorists. The next morning, Kyle wakes up in his bed, and is at first sure the whole thing might have been a dream — until he calls Stan who tells him the same story. They also discover that Butters is missing, much to his parents\' shock. Meanwhile, Cartman, angry that Kyle has refused to fulfill his part of their agreement, takes Kyle to court, where the judge sees the contract Kyle signed and orders Kyle to suck Cartman\'s balls within twenty-four hours or he will be arrested. The United States Department of Defense has received a video from the terrorists, which shows they are holding the survivors of the attack hostage, including Butters. Butters reads a note from the terrorists at gunpoint, and cries out to Stan and Kyle as the video ends. Unsure of how to counter the terrorists, they turn to Hollywood, hoping that they can use their creativity to get ideas. After being disappointed by several directors, including M. Night Shyamalan, who could only come up with twist endings, and Michael Bay, who could only come up with special effects sequences, they seek the advice of Mel Gibson, who suggests that they examine the video the terrorists sent and determine if there is anyone in it that somehow doesn\'t fit. The officials at the Pentagon immediately perform a background check on the video and realize that Butters is not an imaginary character. The general orders his men to locate both Stan and Kyle. In Imaginationland, the terrorists take one of the creatures, "Rockety Rocket", and launch him at "the Barrier", the wall that separates the good and evil halves of Imaginationland. Despite Butters\' attempts to stop them, the terrorists destroy the wall and unleash the evil imaginary creatures. Cartman, meanwhile, dons a Sultan\'s robe and throws a huge party, during which the other kids will watch Kyle suck his balls. Kyle has resigned himself to the task, and is about to walk into Cartman\'s house with Stan when members of the military arrive and take them away for questioning about Imaginationland. Cartman screams in anger about his plan being foiled, then quickly leaves home and hitchhikes with a trucker to Washington, D.C. to force Kyle to fulfill his end of the bet. He ends the episode stating, "Make no mistake, Kyle.

During one of his earlier attempts to make money, Otto inadvertently saves the life of Silvia von Kohlen und Reibach, the young heiress of an enormously wealthy family. Otto is introduced to the Kohlen und Reibachs to receive their gratitude, but Otto is quick to note that he could use their wealth to pay back his debt.

Bruce, over a spurious map showing a sliver of land on the Eastern Seaboard labeled "USA", with all land to its west labeled "INJUN JOE\'S TERRITORY". Porky Pig is leading a wagon train to California and he must keep an eye out for the Herculean Native American "Super Chief", Injun Joe.

Porky and Injun Joe are repeatedly interrupted by a goofy bearded hillbilly named Sloppy Moe , who keeps repeating, "I know something I won\'t tell, I won\'t tell, I won\'t tell!" to the tune of London Bridge is Falling Down. This goes on until Injun Joe corners Porky with tomahawk in hand, and Sloppy Moe sings his refrain once more. Injun Joe grabs him and demands, "What you know, Huh???", and Sloppy reveals his secret at last, "Injun... Joe... is... ticklish!", and proceeds to prove that by tickling the chief with his hands and beard. The Native American goes into a raucous laughing fit.

On the night of the Winter Feast, Po comes to realize that he should be with his father for the holiday and excuses himself before the masters to help Mr. Ping prepare food for the townsfolk. For his part, Mr. Ping, who had been struggling with the business alone, realizes that he was being unfair to his son for attending to his larger responsibilities and apologizes to him. With this reconciliation, father and son prepare their feast with polished skill. Moved by Po's loyalty to his family, the Furious Five and the other masters participate in the festivities with the townsfolk. Po is additionally able to restore Wo Hop's honor by presenting him with the Golden Ladle originally intended for the chef selected to cook for the masters' banquet.

About half way through, Dutch loud mouth and incredibly gay comedian Paul de Leeuw makes his first appearance as the Genie of the Medaillon, painted gold and spitting out thought balloons and animated letters all over the place. You can see right through him, and it looks like all of his scenes were filmed separately. This makes me wonder if he ever met K3 during filming at all. De Leeuw is even more unbelievably loud and annoying than usual, because for some reason every European children\'s movie has to include at least one of these hyperactive character. Luckily, his scenes are kept to a bare minimum. Kathleen wishes to be a princess. Karin  wants to fly and Kristel asks for a mega-bike like Mega Macey. Soon they have spent 98 of their 100 wishes, and that\'s the moment the Genie chooses to explain the 100 wish limit. It\'s also the moment the nasties choose to reveal their dastardly intentions to the girls, forcing Kristel to use the penultimate wish to turn all three of them into Mega Macey . The special effects, cinematography and production design are quite impressive by Studio 100 standards, even the script by Samson & Gert is funnier than their usual material, patented for the K3 audience of pre teenager girls. Although the running time of the film is less than an hour , I believe a short film starring another Verhulst/Verbiest franchise was featured as an appetizer: Piet Piraat, who\'s movie resume at the time of this writing is a tie with the K3 girls: two each. There\'s also a superhero spin off television series called "Mega Mindy". Samson & Gert truly are unstoppable.'] ['"Pure Punjabi" is all about passion, chasing dreams.

Within their final week of school however, Jay\'s grandfather dies, Simon is dumped by his girlfriend Carli, and Will\'s divorced father tells him he has married his much younger mistress. The boys decide to go on holiday together and Neil books them on a trip to Malia, Crete. Their accommodation in Malia is awful, confusing Neil as it apparently looked different on the booking process. On the way to the bars, the boys encounter a strange youngster named Richard  who came alone to Malia for a holiday. While walking past the bars, the boys are tricked into entering a bar which is really empty but meet four girls; Alison, Lucy, Lisa and Jane. Their initial meeting goes less than smoothly as Will chats to Alison and pokes fun at her clichéd "Greek waiter boyfriend", Simon bores Lucy talking about Carli, Neil has a non-conversation with Lisa, and Jay "gets stuck" with the bubbly, if somewhat overweight Jane. The girls go on their way after Neil seduces two older women, but arrange to meet the boys the next day. Outside the bar, Simon sees Carli across the street; this is because Neil asked Carli where she was going and booked the same place. Simon then angrily tells Neil that the point of the holiday was to take his mind off Carli. He talks awkwardly with her before being knocked down by a quad-bike ridden by James, an abusive club rep and Carli\'s new boyfriend. Carli reveals she is going to an all-day boat party later in the week, and Simon pledges to meet her there. The next morning, Will and Simon awaken to the sound of Neil having sex with a middle-aged woman and find Jay sleeping face-down in an ants\' nest outside. After sobering up, they go to meet the girls by their hotel pool. While there, a little boy pushes Jay into the pool and later pulls Jay\'s shorts down, after which Jay throws him into the pool in retaliation, finding out that the boy did not lie when he said he can not swim. The boy is rescued by other hotel patrons. At the same time, a man shows up who had reserved poolside sun-loungers by putting towels on them. He is angry because the boys have thrown the towels in the pool and taken the chairs for themselves. The boys discover that the man has a disabled daughter and staff ask them to leave. Will tries to convince the staff to let him have the seats and points out that his daughter in a wheelchair does not even need another chair. Having publicly humiliated themselves, the boys are quickly ejected from the hotel. Outside, Jay argues with Simon over his continuing obsession with Carli and they fight in the street. Will and Neil separate the pair and drag off Simon and Jay, respectively, in different directions. Desperate to buy a ticket for the boat party, Simon sells his clothes to James, including what he is wearing, but never gets paid for them and is left naked. Meanwhile, Jay angrily tears up two boat party tickets he secretly bought for them as a surprise. He and Neil then go to a nightclub later that night hoping to meet more girls, only to witness a male stripper performing autofellatio on stage. The duo subsequently run into James and his friends, in which Jay is threatened to stick a piece of glass in his throat if he doesn\'t leave. Later that evening, the four boys meet back at the bar and bury the hatchet. Before long, the girls turn up and suggest that they all go skinny dipping at the local beach. Jane attempts to kiss Jay, but he is embarrassed to be seen with her so she leaves him behind. Will has better luck with Alison until she spots her boyfriend having sex with another Greek woman, and leaves crying. Lucy and Simon appear to be growing closer until he sees Carli on the beach and leaves Lucy alone in the sea. Will contemplates suicide, but Neil cheers him up and the boys go out partying. Eventually, they are able to obtain tickets for the boat party and on board, Carli kisses Simon passionately in order to make James jealous, and Simon realises he is being used, and leaves Carli. Jay apologises to Jane, and she takes him into the toilets to perform oral sex. After finishing, they encounter James, who mocks Jane\'s weight and demands a banknote in order to snort drugs from Jay. Jay gives him a €20 note that had been concealed in his anus to be used as a bribe for \'corrupt foreign police\' when necessary, resulting in James unknowingly walking around with faeces on the end of his nose. Neil bumps into Richard during the boat party and is introduced to Richard\'s parents , who came over at Richard\'s request to pick him up. When Neil is about to kiss the mother as a polite gesture, Lisa rushes over and tells her to back off as she thinks Neil is trying to make moves on her. After Neil tells Lisa that his girlfriend back home dumped him, and he did not want to tell the others as to not be embarrassed, they feel no longer limited in the kind of sex they have. Meanwhile, Alison hunts out Will and asks to be his girlfriend, which he eagerly accepts. Simon finally sees that Lucy, who gave him her ticket so that he could attend the party, is more worthy of his attention than Carli. Knowing that he has been less than kind to her, and encouraged by everyone on the boat, he decides to swim all the way to shore to tell her how he feels, as a grand romantic gesture, and dives into the sea. However, he nearly drowns and has to be airlifted to shore. As paramedics load him into an ambulance, a concerned Lucy rushes forward and kisses him, and they reconcile whilst Simon tells her \'It\'s normally bigger, it\'s just cold\'. After the boat party is over, the other boys and girls visit Simon in hospital, and once he recovers they all spend the rest of their holiday together as couples. Eventually, the four boys head home to the UK. As they meet their families at the airport, their girlfriends exit the same terminal and introduce themselves to the boys\' parents as the film ends. In a final scene before the credits, a drunken Mr. Gilbert is seen riding a quad bike through the streets of Malia in his underwear with a tie round his head in a John Rambo style.'] ["Porky is informed that his beloved Train the 13{{frac}} named 'Toots' is to be replaced by a streamline train by the name of 'The Silver Fish'.

Bluto is very reluctant to join in and pretends to be ill. Popeye, who works at the draft bureau, is suspicious and sends a female robot in to create an enthusiastic reaction from him. Even though his trick works Bluto still refuses to join the Navy. In a desperate effort to become disabled Bluto jumps out of the window, followed by Popeye who tries to catch him. They both crash deep into the ground, in fact so deep that Satan himself asks them to leave Hell. After Bluto and Popeye have climbed out of the massive crater Satan is kicked by an angel, after which they both disappear. Bluto tries to flee, but is hit in a car accident. Even though he is knocked out the ambulance is only interested in the tires of the vehicle and carries these away on a stretcher instead of Bluto. Bluto tries to get hit by a falling safe instead, but again Popeye rescues him. This angers Bluto so much that he locks Popeye inside the object and then throws it away. It crashes inside an orphanage, where several Japanese spies are undercover, dressed as babies. While Popeye is being beaten, Bluto drops by to inform him that his arms are bandaged and that he finally will be able to escape the draft. When Bluto sees that Popeye is in trouble, he tries to help, but both men are knocked out by the Japanese. While they are being ridiculed, Popeye grabs his spinach, eats it and gives some to Bluto . Both men defeat the Japanese and Popeye\'s fist reaches so far that he knocks out Hirohito. The Emperor is hit so hard that he falls on the backside of his horse, , and says: "It should happen to Hitler." Sure enough, the next scene cuts to Hitler, who gives a speech by saying: "B.O!" . Hitler too is beaten so hard that he loses his mustache. A title card appears, asking: "Is their a doctor in the house?", with the word "doctor" crossed out and "undertaker" written in crayon. While he lies unconscious, Hermann Göring runs in and asks his Führer melodramatically "to speak to him". Hitler just says "B.O." again, whereupon Goebbels pulls his face away in disgust. The cartoon concludes with Bluto finally signing up for his draft, while the imprisoned Japanese all spell his name: "B-L-U-T-O", in reference to the commercial for Jell-o from that time.'] ["{{tone}} It's a drug that promises an out-of-body experience with each hit.

His mother, Samantha Andrews, is a poor woman living in a mobile home who collects ceramic dolls as a hobby. She meets Gerald’s father, Edward Lamtet, a doll maker, and they fall in love. Samantha gets pregnant, but unfortunately, unbeknownst to Samantha, Edward is already married, leaving Samantha to raise the child, Gerald, by herself. Samantha being too proud to accept support money, Edward sends Samantha a "Number 1" doll. Gerald has trouble growing up. He is slightly mentally challenged due to being dropped on his head at birth by the inebriated on-call doctor. Gerald has few friends other than a neighborhood girl, Helen, and his mother’s eclectic friends; a clueless lush named Ethel, a mother-hen-like transvestite named Dolly, and the straight-and-narrow Kate. Gerald is a good boy, and although not very athletic, he loves bowling. At about age 30, Gerald has been working at the Bowling Emporium for several years. Helen is still a neighbor, and Samantha plays poker with her 3 friends every Friday night. One day Samantha learns that Gerald’s father has died, and that the doll maker’s son is positioning his company to be sold. She realizes she can now provide more for Gerald, because the doll she was given is a valuable "Number 1" doll, and all the “Number 1” dolls are needed to sell the company. That night, she plans to tell Gerald and her friends about the doll’s origin. Instead, Samantha unexpectedly dies and never gets to tell anyone about the doll and its value. As a way to cope with his loss, Gerald decides to have his mother cremated and her ashes put into her favorite doll . Gerald takes the doll, and mother, with him everywhere. One day, he takes her to the laundromat, and someone steals the doll while he is not looking. The police have little interest in searching for a lost "doll". So, Gerald takes it upon himself to find his mother. He puts up fliers of his mother as the doll. He checks the laundromat every day, to the annoyance of the clerk. In spite of his failures, Helen helps Gerald set up a fundraiser at the Bowling Emporium to raise enough money for a private investigator. At this fundraiser, we learn that Gerald can actually take care of himself, financially at least, because he is an excellent  bowler. However, he injures his foot and must go to the emergency room, where ironically he sees a little girl with his mother’s doll, or so he thinks. Gerald confronts the girl and discovers that there are many of the same dolls. The next day, however, Gerald gets an anonymous tip that allows them to track down the doll maker, only to find out that the doll maker has died and that the son of the doll maker is about to sell the company, along with all the “Number 1” dolls, within the next couple of days. They make an appointment to visit with the doll maker’s son. Mother’s doll has “mysteriously” re-appeared at the doll company’s museum. During the meeting, the son ignores Gerald’s request for the doll back and continues to prepare for the sale of the company, pushing it up to the next day. Neither Gerald nor the son put two-and-two together to realize that they are brothers, although Helen sees an uncanny resemblance. Gerald is desperate, and Gerald and with the help of Helen and friends, decides to break into the toy company after closing to steal his mother\'s ashes back. That night, Gerald, Helen, Dolly, with two of Dolly’s leather-clad friends, break into the building and make it to the museum, passing by security and avoiding the son, who is in his office speaking with his lawyer and assistant. As Gerald and the gang are attempting to exit the building with the doll, the son and his group find Gerald trying to get through the warehouse, and a fight and chase ensues. The chase ends at a wall of boxes in the warehouse where the son pulls a gun and insists on getting the doll back. At this point, the son’s assistant, who was his father’s assistant since day one, finally tells everyone the story about Gerald’s mother and how she came to own the "Number 1" doll. Everyone, to the son’s dismay, realizes that the son and Gerald are brothers. The lawyer also realizes that this makes Gerald part owner in the company, due to a flaw in the doll maker’s will. This leaves Gerald very rich and more importantly, the owner of the doll which contains his mother’s ashes. But Gerald does not forget his roots once he is rich. He marries Helen and continues to work at the Bowling Emporium, although he now is the owner; and everyday, Gerald’s mother watches over him as he comes and goes from her perch by the door.'] ["John Scaduto , a troublesome high school senior makes a deal with his parents that he will not get into anymore trouble until he graduates to receive $10,000 gift from them.

Surely enough, it’s Sam, bouncing on a trampoline in another effort to catch Tweety. Sylvester cuts the trampoline with a pair of scissors and Sam hits the ground with a loud thud, nearly knocking Tweety off his perch. There is a continuity error in that the barbed wire in this and subsequent scenes no longer appears near the top of the pole, but only near the base; the portion just under Tweety's nest is bare of wire. Sam then sneaks out again and looks in Sylvester’s window to find him gone, then looks up to discover Sylvester walking on the wire overhead with an umbrella. Sam cuts the wire with a pair of scissors, sending Sylvester crashing through two windows in a building nearby. Sylvester then closes his now bare-wire umbrella as he descends to the ground, and Sam giggles gleefully. Next, Sylvester dons a Batman costume and soars through the air in an attempt to swoop in on Tweety, but again Sam has thought along the same lines. The two bang heads in mid-air and both plummet back to earth, landing in the garbage dump. Sylvester paces the floor trying to think of what to do next, then peeks out the door to see Sam tiptoeing his way over. Sylvester places a coonskin cap in his box and covers it with a blanket, and when Sam sees it he “knocks him out” with a club. Sam then sneaks over to the pole, not realizing that Sylvester is following right behind him. Sam has a balloon on a string held down by a rock already set. He ties the string around his waist , pushes the rock away to release the balloon, and grabs Tweety on the way up, but Sylvester slaps his paw, and again Sam hands him the “just seeing if he was OK” alibi as the two continue to float upward. Sylvester then stabs the balloon with a pin  and the two plunge back to the ground together in a deadly drop, to which Tweety responds: “Y’know, I never reawized just being a wittle bird could be so compwicated.”"] ['Five incorrigible crooks, frustrated by their disappointing career as bank robbers, decide to switch from bank heists to kidnapping European celebrities.

The two have an extremely close love-hate mother/daughter relationship as Emma grows up. The film follows both women across several years as each find their reasons for going on living and finding joy. Emma gets married immediately upon graduating High School in the Houston area, while her best friend Patsy  continues on to college, eventually becoming successful and rich in New York City.

Ralph does not work with Sam in this one, unlike later shorts.  1. Ralph\'s first plan is to trick Sam into going home early, by turning the time on the punch clock forward and setting the whistle off. Sam is initially tricked into thinking that the whistle indicated quitting time, punches out, and heads home. However, he quickly notices on the clock of a church steeple that it\'s 9:00 with its bells chiming and hurries back to see Ralph carrying a comically large pile of sheep. Sam Sheepdog suddenly appears behind a tree and breaks a tree branch over Ralph\'s head, driving Ralph into the ground . 2. Ralph\'s second attempt involves disguising himself as a bush. After stealing a sheep and starting to run away, he runs past Sam, who himself is disguised as a tree and starts to follow Ralph. Sam hits Ralph on the head with a branch, leaving Ralph very confused and with a large lump on his head. After attempting to run further, this occurs once more, and Ralph is left with two lumps on his head. Ralph then gives up and carries the sheep back to the field as Sam impatiently taps his foot . 3. For Ralph\'s third attempt, he reads a book of Greek myths which explains that Pan would "lull shepherds to sleep with the music of his pipes and then steal the sheep." Disguising himself as Pan, Ralph attempts to lull Sam to sleep with a flute, but Sam merely punches Ralph in the face and Ralph stumbles away and continues to play his song, out of tune. 4. Ralph\'s fourth attempt involves tunnelling under the field and pulling each sheep down through very small holes. This is mostly successful, until Ralph unwittingly pulls Sam underground and gets punched in the face. Ralph politely returns all the sheep and refills his tunnel. 5. In Ralph\'s next attempt, he places an Acme product behind Sam, labelled "One Acme wild-cat - Handle with care". Ralph carefully opens the box with a rope from a distance behind another hill, but the wildcat simply runs in circles towards Ralph, maims him and scratches him. 6. Ralph\'s sixth attempt is to swing on a rope over the field and snatch a sheep. Unfortunately, he unwittingly snatches Sam out of the flock. After realizing this, he leaves Sam at the bottom of the rope and climbs to the branch that the rope is tied to and saws the end of the branch off. After seemingly sending Sam crashing to the ground, Sam appears on further down the branch and saws it off at that point, sending Ralph falling. After Ralph seemingly hits the ground, he appears at the start of the branch. This gag continues until Sam is on the end of a cliff and Ralph uses a pick axe to detach the edge of the cliff and send Sam falling. The cartoon then disobeys gravity and leaves Sam\'s piece of earth floating in the air, as the rest of the cliff which Ralph is standing on falls down. 7. Ralph\'s next, seventh, and seemingly final attempt is to snatch a sheep which is drinking from edge of a lake. He uses a hollow rush to swim through the lake unnoticed. Sam notices the rush sticking out of the water and drops a stick of dynamite into it. Damaged by a small underwater explosion like "tsunami", Ralph surfaces and then sinks like a ship. 8. At the end of the short, Sam walks toward the punch clock as his replacement George Sheepdog punches in and greets him. Sam hits him over the head with a plank, and the viewers see that George is really Ralph in a disguise. As Sam begins spanking Ralph with the club, the REAL George Sheepdog shows up and takes over for him, who continues spanking Ralph.'] ['Mayumi  is a girl with a happy disposition in life who dreams of meeting her "the one" someday.

And thus it forms the crux of the film ‘Nino Live’. Based in the modern age, the film shows how an entire life can go public in this era of wires and networks. The film revolves around the journey of a child from adolescence to early manhood, all caught on celluloid. Ripping off his personal domain, his existence is dished out in the form of unedited footage, broadcasted live 24*7 on television. This gigantic show, named ‘Nino Live’, becomes a way of life for thousands of reality TV struck fans around the country. How his first kiss is food for entertainment to lakhs of people watching it live or how his mundane anecdotes are glorified to death; every chore fascinates fiercely. Without his knowledge, his actions and thoughts hypnotize an entire nation. Trapped on thousands of cameras parked where ever he puts a foot at, even the drift of an eyelash does not go unnoticed. The massive electronic and human setup thriving on this artificial world is controlled from a studio owned by an enterprising producer who during the course of the film, is established as the father of the protagonist – ‘Nino’. The film graduates slowly to his quest of comprehending and deconstructing his life. Growing up, he deciphers each action and every event in his life. They all start to seem fabricated to him. He progressively understands he lives in a manufactured society and he needs to break free to see the real world. Many instances serve as catalysts in this process. The sudden disappearance of his beloved and the resurfacing of a different person as she, the behavioural changes he observes emerging in people close to him, make him paranoid by the day and this itch causes him to revolt out of the engineered world. How all these episodes affect a nation thereafter and how fans of such a massive show react, take the story forward in a way which drifts beautifully. From the dilemma of the producer to the hunger of a nation, everything is suddenly left unconnected. How a ‘Nino Live’ struck fan parallels her life exactly to that of the protagonist’s and how she finally connects these chords, outlines and structures the remainder of the film.'] ['A small-town girl who just moved to Manhattan is taken under the wing of her gay cousin, a seasoned New Yorker.'] ["Narsimha is a rowdy whose life ambition is to become an MLA, he murders people and works as a henchman to the Home Minister in hopes of getting the seat.

But Bobby kicks him out of the house, telling him to die like a man, and expressing his disgust with Collin\'s murder. Afterward, Bobby discovers a secret door. Ashley, his partner, agrees to explore the passageway. She finds a way out, and tries to escape, but is discovered before she can reach the road, and is decapitated. This greatly upsets Jenny, as she is the only one left besides Bobby. It is also revealed that Claude has a crush on Jenny. Realizing that it would be best, Bobby decides to kill himself during the next challenge so that Jenny can win. After winning, Jenny is taken back to the house and guarded by Claude until the "party". Knowing that Claude likes her, she begins flirting with him- telling him that she loves him and kissing him. Claude lets her go after this experience, but Phillip finds out about it and captures Jenny before she can escape. However, her escape attracts the attention of the police; and although Phillip was able to kill the first policeman, he knows there will be more. Phillip kisses his brother Claude good bye, telling him to stay. As Phillip escapes, police enter the house and arrest Claude- thus rescuing Jenny. Mikko is never seen killed or rescued, so it is safe to assume that she is alive, as the police would have searched everything in the area, unless she starved to death, which is highly unlikely given the others survived until the police came. At the end for the final scene we see Jenny and a friend walking into a monorail when a message appears on her cell phone that was stated at the beginning of the contest saying "Please Leave Your Cell Phones By The Door" Phillip appears on her phone and a hand grabs her by her shoulder  ending the movie.'] ['Yaar Annmulle is the story of three friends - Guri, Deep and Sher Singh, who are studying in a university and are staying together in the hostel of the same university.

Later, Tom, with his broken foot wrapped in bandages, is given a nice pie from Mammy as a token of her gratitude, as well as an apology for her misunderstanding.

The preacher escapes on foot. Lightfoot, who happens to be driving by, inadvertently rescues him by running over his pursuer and giving the preacher a lift. Lightfoot eventually learns that the "minister" is really a notorious bank robber known as "The Thunderbolt"  for his use of a 20 millimeter cannon to break into a safe. Hiding out in the guise of a clergyman following the robbery of a Montana bank, Thunderbolt is the only member of his old gang who knows where the loot is hidden. After escaping another attempt on his life by two other men, Thunderbolt tells Lightfoot that the ones trying to kill him are members of his gang who mistakenly thought Thunderbolt had double-crossed them. He and Lightfoot journey to Warsaw, Montana to retrieve the money hidden in an old one-room schoolhouse. They discover the schoolhouse has been replaced by a brand-new school standing in its place. Thunderbolt and Lightfoot are abducted by the men who were shooting at them -- the vicious Red Leary  and the gentle Eddie Goody ([[Geoffrey Lewis  -- and driven to a remote location where Thunderbolt and Red fight each other, after which Thunderbolt explains how he never betrayed the gang. Lightfoot proposes another heist — robbing the same company as before — with a variation on the original plan, since Lightfoot inadvertently killed their electronics expert, Dunlap, in his rescue of the fleeing preacher. In the city where the bank is located, the men find jobs to raise money for needed equipment while they plan the heist. The robbery begins as Thunderbolt and Red gain access to the building.

Using an anti-tank cannon to breach the vault\'s wall, as they did in the first heist, the gang escapes with the loot. They flee in the car, with Red and Goody in the trunk, to a nearby drive-in movie in progress. Upon seeing a shirt tail protruding from the car\'s trunk lid, the suspicious theater manager calls the police and a chase ensues. Goody is shot and Red throws him out of the trunk onto a dirt road, where he dies. Red then forces Thunderbolt and Lightfoot to stop the car. He pistol-whips them both, knocking them unconscious, and kicks Lightfoot violently in the head. Red takes off with the loot in the getaway car but is again pursued by police, who shoot Red several times, causing him to lose control of the car and crash through the window of a department store, where he is attacked and killed by the store\'s vicious watchdog. Escaping on foot, Thunderbolt and Lightfoot hitch a ride the next morning and are dropped off near Warsaw, Montana, where they stumble upon the one-room schoolhouse - now an historical monument on the side of a highway - moved there from its original location in Warsaw after the first heist. As the two men retrieve the stolen money, Lightfoot\'s behavior becomes erratic as a result of the beating. Thunderbolt buys a new Cadillac convertible with cash, something Lightfoot said he had always wanted to do, and picks up his waiting partner, who is gradually losing control of the left side of his body. As they drive away celebrating their success with cigars, Lightfoot, in obvious distress, tells Thunderbolt in a slurred voice how proud he is of their \'accomplishments\', and slumps over dead. Thunderbolt snaps Lightfoot\'s cigar in half, and with his dead partner beside him, he drives off down the highway into the distance.'] ["18th century soldiers General Burlap  and Colonel Kelsoe  are desperate to prevent war, and hatch a plan to capture a warmongering military commander and hold him prisoner until the threat of hostilities passes.

She goes into the living room, where she finds them lazing around and drinking cream. Sarcastically pleased that the cats are satisfied, she yells at them, warning them that the one who catches Jerry can stay. The 2 cats frantically begin their search for Jerry, and are unsuspectingly aided by him, before realizing Jerry was under their noses the whole time. They scramble to catch Jerry, but instead become entangled. On only one of their eight feet, they tiptoe across the floor, until Jerry motions at them to stop and hits that foot with a fireplace log. This was Butch\'s left foot; he screams, jumping up and down, clutching Tom\'s left foot and eventually noticing he\'s got the wrong foot. He lets go of Tom\'s foot and grabs his foot, screaming appropriately. The chase continues as Tom and Butch both grab Jerry together and decide to have a duel using a pair of guns they find lying around.

Jerry escapes from the box and rings a boxing gong, ending the fight, and cleans up and coaches Tom and Butch to hit each other. Jerry rings the gong and both cats end up punching each other, as planned. They realise they\'ve been tricked and glance towards Jerry, who is making fun of them by punching the air. Both of them pull up on either side of the mouse, incensed at the idea of a mouse tricking them into bopping each other. Eventually seeing he is trapped between the two cats and thus also realising that he pushed them around too far, the mouse chooses Butch via Eeny Meeny Mine Mo, makes a face to Tom, and sits down in Butch\'s hand. Butch assumes that he has Jerry in his clutches and dares Tom to walk out in the morning. Tom slumps down and walks away, then hides behind a curtain. Butch is reveling in his victory until Tom reaches out and grabs Jerry directly out of the other cat\'s hand. Butch turns the corner and opens the curtain to find only Tom, who pretends to not know where the mouse is; in reality, he is underneath the cat, who lifts Lightning up and carries him around to reveal himself. Tom simply continues with the charade, and Butch grabs Tom, revealing the mouse underneath, who soon sees Tom is missing. Butch drops him into the trash can and chases Jerry. Annoyed, Tom runs into the kitchen, dressing himself in Mammy\'s clothing to trick Butch. Butch enters the kitchen, with Jerry clenched in his fist, and offers him to Tom, thinking that he is Mammy. He wallops Butch over the head with a frying pan, dashes out of his disguise and runs off with Jerry. Butch regains consciousness and runs into the living room, wearing Mammy\'s clothing, while pretending to arrange the bookshelves; he manages to fall for the same trick, getting walloped over the head with a chimney shovel. Butch runs off with Jerry until he runs straight into an ironing board and knocks himself out; Jerry escapes from Butch\'s clutches and runs off.

As Tom peeks through a door, the two cats hit her on the butt repeatedly with their weapons, thinking that the other cat is in disguise.

So Chanfle said: "That isn\'t saving, that is spending!". After that Tere said: "Nope, it\'s saving, because I bought them in the supermarket and nobody charged me for them", making Chanfle realize that his wife took a pair of shoes without paying them, so he  rolled up two imaginary sleevs and returned to the store with Tere. There, he paid 299 pesos, in order to pay for the shoes, to a nice lady cashier store clerk , who told them that already their bosses would discount that amount from her salary, therefore he did not have to pay for the shoes.

So, Chanfle\'s boss and president of the club, Mr. Matute  knew that after Chanfle asked him a raise.

So he went to the clerk and asked her who was the owner of the car with the license plates: 631-ACJ. When the clerk heard that she sadly said: "Only yesterday, I had my car at the mechanic". Another worry for Chanfle and Tere: they didn\'t have money for paying to the lady\'s car damage, nor to repair their old sofa. This problem was solved when Tere went once again to the supermarket and gave the nice clerk 100 pesos for the car\'s repair. Then, the clerk confessed that her husband wanted to buy a gun. When Tere heard this, she promptly and very happily said: "I\'ll sell you one!!!". That evening, she sold the gun to the supermarket clerk and now Tere was debt-free. So the months go by, and Tere was going to give birth. Club America is expected to play the championship game against Atletico Español and Tere is expecting to have her child after the game, so she went to the soccer stadium with Diana , the soccer club\'s secretary, who was in love with one of the most popular players at the team, Valentino . Then Tere met again with the clerk and her husband Paco, who said, stranged: "Have we met before??", during the game, Tere began to give birth so, with the help of Tere and the nice clerk she is taken to the infirmary to be attended by Dr. Najera. At the same time, Valentino cheated to provoke a penalty kick which helped América get a goal. In the second half, Chanfle learns that his wife was about to give birth, at the same time that an Atletico defender puts Valentino down to sentence another penalty kick. At that moment, Chanfle daydreamed about his son to be, dreaming that the boy became a famous player for America  and is able to be a forward for his team scoring an irrational number of goals for America in that game. But he wakes up after kicking coach Don Moncho again when daydreaming about his son shooting a penalty kick. After this he is kicked off the game intentionally in order to see his wife. Chanfle bumped with Paco again, who had the gun already on his hands, and was going to kill Chanfle. The wild run which ensued, caused them to enter the stadium again and both end causing the game to be suspended. While Tere is suffering with the birth pain at the same time as Valentino is suffering due to the lesion he got in game. When Valentino sees Tere he asked her what is going on, and she tell him "We\'ll have a baby", surprised  he began to scream stronger. Paco chased Chanfle to the medical office, where Tere was giving birth to a girl, to Chanfle\'s dismay. So, the clerk explained to her husband that Chanfle was that honest man who paid his wife\'s soes and sold her the pistol. Paco still thought that Chanfle was trying to rob him, until Tere said that her husband\'s real purpose was selling the gun when Paco was drunk. Tere then said that Paco couldn\'t kill Chanfle because the pistol was broken. Then Chanfle, hearing this, asked Paco: "How much do I owe you?". At the end, Mr. Matute announced that Chanfle wasn\'t going to be in his current job, instead he\'ll be the Children\'s team coach. At the time when Chanfle was going to sign his contract, he accidentally broke all the office furniture and also a "The End" glass sign.'] ["When jockey Muggs is mistakenly accused of cheating in a big race, he gets disqualified and suspended from racing.

Shortly after, he is waken up by some crunching noises, warning him of intruders. Using a rocket that creates a flare in the sky, the dog spots the Goofy Gophers  eating some of the vegetables, so he disguises himself as a tomato vine  and poses as the actual plant in the garden. As morning dawns, Mac and Tosh go about the garden taking up every vegetable that looks interesting, including a real long carrot . Mac gathers up the "tomatoes" just as Tosh imitates Bugs Bunny saying "What\'s up, doc?" While Mac is studying the pumpkin, the dog blows his cover and after asking him if he\'d tried the pumpkin, Mac throws it into his face. Mac then asks the dog if he\'d had his daily iron, to which after the dog answers no, Mac hits him over the head with a shovel. The dog runs after Mac, but Mac dives into a hole and the shovel prevents the dog from pursuing him. After gathering up a bushel of vegetables and posing as Southern speaking ladies, Mac and Tosh duck back into their holes. The dog tries digging them out, but Tosh squirts him with a tomato. The gophers then taunt the dog from many holes as he tries to decapitate them with the clippers. While the dog\'s back is turned, the gophers take the advantage to give him the ultimate "hot foot" , which sends the dog fleeing for the rain barrel to extinguish it. Next, the gophers pull down vegetables to the tune of a Conga beat. The dog\'s first attempt to stop them only results in Mac punching him in the nose, so the dog ducks behind vegetables and disguises himself as the scarecrow. Right after the dog states how his "razor keen mind" aids him, he is pulled into the ground, but kicked out again, along with the scarecrow, dressed as a telegram man from Western Onion, complete with a note from the gophers which reads "We\'re vegetarians, you dope!" Underground, Tosh tries to make choices on certain fruit and vegetables, only to have them turned down by Mac . The gophers then come across a celery, which has been bobby-trapped by the dog, but the gophers turn the tables on him by having the dog pull himself underground. Straight after, the gophers proceed to steamroll him into the ground and call him "Silly Boy!" The dog manages to get out of the ground and reaches into another hole for the gophers. Mac, however, stalls him with a hand grenade, making the dog pull out the pin. Spotting the pin on his finger, the dog starts showing it off as if it were a class ring, but while passing over the grenade underground, the grenade explodes and makes him fall flat to the ground, looking worse for the wear. Later, while the gophers are relaxing eating vegetables, an attractive Southern Belle gopher  comes up, attracting the gophers\' lovestruck interest. Mac takes the first opportunity to dance with the female gopher and allows Tosh to cut in. Tosh\'s turn to dance has him pull off the female gopher, exposing the dog\'s paw. The gophers then turn the tables on the dog again by tricking his paw into dancing straight into a mousetrap. That evening, the dog takes a stick of dynamite, puts it into a carrot he cuts in half, and lights the fuse, but Mac cuts the fuse and Tosh fakes the explosion with a blown up paper bag. Thinking he\'s rid of the gophers for good, the dog celebrates by doing another round of guarding and then falling asleep. The gophers, however, put him on the rocket launcher and aim it for the moon. Next, they shove a stick of dynamite into the dog\'s mouth, light it, and Mac sets up a camera. As Tosh blows into a bird\'s whistle, the dog wakes up and poses for a picture, but the dynamite explodes, sending him flying into space and crashing into the moon so that it breaks into four quarter moons, rocking to the closing notes of the tune Rock-a-bye Baby. Triumphant in their defeat of the dog, the gophers saw down the "Beware of dog" sign and rejoice. Just as Mac and Tosh gloat that they\'ll now have no trouble in raiding the garden, their moment of victory is cut short by crunching sounds. The camera reveals it is Bugs Bunny, having just eaten the gophers\' stash of carrots, who says "Well, um, now I wouldn\'t say that," just as a closing iris ends the cartoon.'] ['“Farhad Khan” ([[Riaz  an young man, his loves with “Shiri” ([[Purnima  heart and soule.

This is depicted as a crass cross-genre detective/cookery series , whose lead character  presents his recipe in a style that parodies Keith Floyd. Allen\'s "on-screen" Gourmet Detective character is the epitome of politically correct "new man" compassion, but the actor "off-screen" is shown to be an obnoxious, drug-taking womaniser. He is subsequently murdered – the second TV detective to be killed in six months – and the rest of the film involves the search for his assassin. The police commander (played by [[Jim Carter  is exasperated that the detective assigned to the case, Dave Spanker, has come up with lots of "Northern nostalgia" but no leads. Cheesecloth and the footprint of a 1970s platform shoe are found at the scene, inspiring him to bring in 1970s-style detectives to help solve the crime – initially Bonehead, Foyle and George. When the platform shoe is revealed to be from the early 1970s, Jason Bentley is added to the team, and the commander insists that Bentley\'s methods alone are to be used . Bentley consequently drives the detectives to a random country house, drinks copious claret, smokes endless cigarettes, and predictably gets nowhere with the case. The frustrated detectives have a punch-up while they are – on Bentley\'s advice – "waiting for a Mini Moke to turn up". The commander gives the team a dressing-down, and explains that, with the TV-cop-killer still at large, the production of various 1990s TV cop shows is under threat. In order to highlight further the writers\' views of contemporary TV detective shows, he lists these as The Dull as Dishwater Detective, Detectives on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown and The Whistling Detective Who Lives on a Barge. The Dull as Dishwater Detective is apparently in hiatus because "the actor\'s run abroad, he\'s scared" – a reference to the real TV series Inspector Morse, whose lead actor John Thaw was making A Year in Provence at this time. Thaw had previously played Regan in The Sweeney. Bonehead, Foyle and George insist they be allowed to proceed with the investigation their way, complete with fast cars and guns. The commander reluctantly agrees to give them 48 hours, and they gleefully wheel-spin away to a rendezvous at an East End drinking den. Meanwhile, a sheepish Bentley asks to see the original lab reports. At the pub, George asks to see his informant, while Bonehead and Foyle order Babychams then storm the toilet cubicles the way they might storm an embassy. However, Bentley provides the breakthrough. He reveals that the forensic report proves the platform shoes were bought in Newcastle upon Tyne. After Spanker confesses that he committed the crimes due to TV ratings pressure, he makes his escape. There ensues a 1970s-style high-speed car chase involving all but Bentley, based mainly in a large yard where all three cars drive around somewhat pointlessly in circles. The repeated handbrake-turns wreck Foyle\'s gearbox and, in frustration at missing out on the car chase, Bonehead briefly considers leaving his partner. However, the chase continues on foot into London Docklands, where Spanker takes refuge. Bonehead and Foyle – as is customary for them – remove their trousers for this final showdown, and then bemoan the Docklands redevelopment that has taken place since the 1970s: "where\'s all the wasteland and disused factories?". They nevertheless negotiate the area trouserlessly as if it is still full of rusty girders and rubble, to the bemusement of passing city workers. Meanwhile, George attempts to talk Spanker into a surrender. Spanker complains that, with the increased realism in TV detective shows, he has missed out on the fast cars and the "shoot a man at a hundred yards crap" enjoyed by his 1970s counterparts. To prove the point, he feels no ill effects when George shoots him from this very distance as an apparent 1970s denouement to the scene. However, Bentley now magically appears exactly where the plot requires him to appear, right alongside Spanker. In a typically relaxed and tangential fashion, he manages to capture the detective effortlessly. George devises a punishment for Spanker far worse than being shot at close range – Spanker will instead be "shot on tape". He has his scruffy hair cut to a regulation police constable\'s length, in order to take his place as "a faceless copper in uniform - three nights a week". Spanker\'s suitably TV-based punishment is to become a member of the cast of The Bill. The film ends on an up-beat note, with Bonehead, Foyle, George, Bentley and the commander all drinking to "the Seventies".'] ["This movie is not the sequel of Malaamaal Weekly.

Unknown to Jeong Bae, Da-rim recently lost her job as a sex columnist at magazine Hot Girl — edited by her friend Ma Kyung-sun — where she compensated for her lack of experience with men by copying material from the Kama Sutra to the Kinsey Reports. For the manhwa competition, Da-rim comes up with the idea of a female assassin, Ma Mi-so, who keeps her male victims captive for erotic kicks; without telling Jeong Bae, she models the victim on her twin brother, womanising Han Jong-soo, who shares a flat with her and cannot wait for her to move out. She finally does, which leads Jeong Bae\'s friend  Hae-ryong, who has secretly bugged his flat, to believe they\'re having an affair. However, from her unrealistic sex scenes, Jeong Bae gradually comes to suspect that Da-rim has never actually "done it", and then realizes she\'s developed a crush on him.{{cite news}}'] ["Destiny  is a 10-year-old orphan girl in Iowa who gets placed with Ethan  and Jill Emmet .

The town\'s Communist party led by Peppone has just won the majority of seats within the city council, an event which they exploit for propagandistic purposes - and with some non-vocal, but church bell-assisted protest by the outraged Don Camillo, the spiritual leader of the town\'s Christian political party -, when an unexpected event puts an instant stop to this arising conflict: Peppone has just added a new member, a son, to his family, and following a personal and pugilistic appeal by Peppone himself  to a reluctant Don Camillo, the child is baptized in Camillo\'s church. Similar conflicts arising in the course of the story are settled between Don Camillo and Peppone in a similarly conflicting, but ultimately unified fashion, such as: *the erection of a kindergarten for the town after Don Camillo finds out that Peppone has used money stolen from the fascists during World War II to finance the construction of his new community hall and blackmails him with this knowledge; *a farmhand strike organized by the Communists to impose a special tax on the wealthier landowners in order to give the town\'s people work, resulting in the local cattle herds not getting milked until both Don Camillo and Peppone surreptitiously resolve the problem together; *a river blessing procession and the funeral of the town\'s generally respected old teacher, Ms. Christina, which are both kept strictly non-political despite the Communists\' initial intentions; An important side story within the film is the Romeo and Juliet-esque relationship between a young girl named Gina Filotti, who has just returned to the town from boarding school as the story begins, and a young man named Mariolino Brusco. Gina and Mariolino\'s blossoming relationship, however, is off to a bad start: not only that the families of Gina  and Mariolino  are on ideologically opposite sides, they are also entertaining a long-running private feud. When their cause finds no support with neither Peppone as the mayor, nor with Camillo as a priest, the two lovers decide to commit a double suicide. Fortunately, both opposing parties come to their senses just in time, rescue the two and get the wedding underway; but during the combined wedding and house-warming festivities for the now-finished community hall and kindergarten, Don Camillo takes offense at one of Peppone\'s better throws at an Aunt Sally stall, which results in a public mass brawl. Even though Peppone resents Don Camillo\'s interferences and their after-effects on personal health, he secretly enjoys their amicable quarrels and repeatedly tries his best to persuade the local bishop not to have Camillo replaced. However, with this last misdeed the bishop decides to send Camillo to a different community, and Peppone has threatened Camillo\'s parish not to say farewell to him as he is about to depart. But to his delightful surprise, Don Camillo does receive a touching goodbye from the people of his town - first from his parish at the train station next town, then from Peppone and his party comrades at the very next station afterward. Before Camillo departs for his new destination, Peppone asks him to come back soon and promises that Camillo\'s successor will not last long under his attention.'] ["The residents of a large town are inexplicably turning into rhinoceroses.

Donna gives her a Secretech, a device for secretaries that helps organize events and has Raven conduct a video conference on it. She assures Donna that she knows how to use one, even though she doesn\'t, and no one can help her. She accidentally sends the photographer, Pistache, to the Tipton in Milan, Italy. Also, the models  did not get their plane ticket from Raven, so the models are stuck in the made-up country of Budapragoslovakia. While Raven is talking to Zack and Cody she has a vision. She tells them to put their hands out and they end up catching a celebrity, Tyler  which is how she gets the twins to help her. As a result, Raven substitutes the fashion models with Zack and Cody, and she pretends to be Pistache. Donna Cabonna finds out the bad news so she tries to take matters into her own hands by impersonating the photographer too. As the two Pistache impersonators are doing the photo shoot, the real Pistache comes in, having arrived by "an outrageously expensive private jet" . She notes that Zack and Cody are not the models she chose, but they are even better. She tells them to turn around and she takes pictures of their backs. The episode seems to end on a happy note with Raven\'s vision that has Donna Cabonna saying that the boy\'s line is a success. However, the episode turns sour when Raven misses her flight because her Secretech has the wrong time in Boston which is 3 hours ahead from San Francisco. Meanwhile, Cory and Eddie find out that Chelsea is a natural at paddleball, so they try to get Chelsea to break the record for the world\'s longest paddleball session so they can claim the prize money. They think they have the record in the bag until the competition—none other than Stanley—proves to be a formidable paddle ball opponent. Chelsea scams Stanley and wins the title and prize money. She then feels bad and ends up giving Stanley the money. Cory and Eddie are furious with Chelsea because Stanley has scammed her. Chelsea responds that not only does she not feel scammed but both she and Stanley got what they wanted, the record and the money respectively. When Eddie and Cory protest that they did not get what they wanted , she slyly responds that they "got what they deserved" . Then she proceeds to break the record for the longest paddleball session behind her back.  After the Tipton\'s concierge, Irene, tells Raven that her flight is cancelled, Raven is stuck in Boston for the weekend. She then has a vision that Cody is in danger of being attacked. Raven tells them that she has a "feeling" that the one in a sweater vest is in trouble and should avoid sneezing followed by bells. Cody, the only twin that wears sweater vests, becomes paranoid and avoids anything that remotely resembles Raven\'s "premonition" - even the surprise birthday party that he, Zack and the other Tipton employees are throwing for Carey. Zack wears Cody\'s black sweater vest to Carey\'s surprise party so that Cody isn\'t in danger, but becomes in danger when Arwin\'s present goes out of control. Upon hearing sneezing and bells, a frantic Zack lands head first into the cake-which has Hannah\'s favorite flavor, vanilla. Meanwhile, Maddie is trying to help Raven by getting London to wear one of Raven\'s original designs, but London swears she\'ll never wear anything that\'s not from a famous designer, even her diapers are made by designers. So Maddie switched the label of London\'s Attoro Vittali and sews it onto Raven\'s dress. London wears the dress thinking that it is a Vittali original. Maddie tells her the truth, and London gets upset that Maddie tricked her into wearing an unknown dress. However she changes her mind when teen pop star Hannah Montana checks in and admires Raven\'s dress and asks her to make a similar one. London, who has known Hannah since she  sang at London\'s birthday party, now says that she loves it. Hannah asks Raven to make her a dress and goes to look at London\'s however London doesn\'t allow her. Raven is so happy and says to Maddie Oh My Gosh! London Tipton and Hannah Montana are having a catfight over my dress!!. However, when Hannah fights with London her ring gets caught in the dress and it tears  and it doesn\'t go well with Raven and Maddie.  When Hannah Montana/Miley Stewart stays at the Tipton, she befriends the candy counter girl Maddie Fitzpatrick. Listening to Miley\'s dad sing, Maddie says that he sounds just like Robbie Ray, the "Honkytonk Heartthrob", before realizing that he is Robbie Ray. Apparently both she and her mother were Robbie Ray fans. When Maddie talks to Hannah/Miley about his career back in the day, Miley starts to believe that her father gave up his dream to sing so that Miley could pursue her own career as Hannah Montana. To give him back the stage life, she recruits the help of his former manager to get Robby back on the road. Robby goes to San Diego while Hannah\'s bodyguard Roxy Roker takes care of Miley and her brother Jackson. Unfortunately, Roxy is very overprotective and will not let the children go out of her sight, and even ties them up along with her when they sleep. Jackson gets fed up and goes to San Diego, followed by Miley and Roxy. Billy Ray Cyrus  performs "I Want My Mullet Back" in this episode. However, upon watching his father\'s performance and hearing about him being offered to go on tour in Hawaii with Toby Keith, Jackson changes his mind.

At the end of the episode both Robby and Miley perform an encore performance of "I Want My Mullet Back", complete with mullet wigs and Jackson, also wearing a mullet, doing the underarm trumpet. Maddie then also shows up as a crazed Robbie Ray fan, but is then chased away by Roxy. Little is shown of Hannah\'s stay at the Tipton.

Married to a very devout wife, Susheela, and a father of two , Kanji is a hardcore non-believer and routinely indulges in activities such as tricking customers into paying huge sums of money for his statues under false pretenses, and drinking alcohol while on pilgrimage. He also disrupts a local festival in order to get his son away from the celebration. The Hindu priest presiding over the function, Siddheshwar Maharaj, shouts at him and says that "God will curse you". That night a small earthquake occurs in Mumbai, but there are no damages at all to property or life - except for Kanji Bhai\'s shop, which has been destroyed completely. Susheela, along with Kanji\'s neighbours, tells him to accept God so that his misfortunes will end. Kanji refuses, and digs through the shop\'s rubble to find his Godrej safe, which is still intact. Opening it, it he produces his insurance papers, saying that "no damage has been done". However, the next day at the insurance office, Kanji and Mahadev are told that the policy does not cover any damage caused by earthquakes, which are classified as an "Act of God". Without insurance coverage, Kanji attempts to sell the land his shop used to sit on, but is told by his real estate agent that there is a rumour going around saying the plot is "cursed", and that no buyers have come forward. Out of options, Kanji decides to file a lawsuit against God. At the high court, Kanji is unable to get a lawyer, as none of them want the hassle of such a lawsuit. He eventually visits Hanif Qureshi , a poor Muslim lawyer who was attacked and crippled by Islamic extremists for taking Hindu clients. Qureshi agrees to help Kanji, but warns that since he is bed-ridden without the use of his legs, he can only file the case, and Kanji will have to argue it himself. Kanji agrees, and together they send legal notices to the insurance company, as well as Siddheshwar Maharaj, summoning him to court along with his senior, Gopi Maiyya  and the group\'s founder, Leeladhar . Although a Guru of the Sect  asks the three of them to at least arrange a meeting with Kanji and hear out his problem, they refuse, deciding instead to confront him in court. During the preliminary hearing, Siddheshwar takes the stand, calling Kanji a "fool and sinner" and saying that God would not come to Earth for the likes of him. The insurance company\'s lawyer  asks the judge to dismiss the case immediately, calling it a waste of the court\'s time, but Kanji points out that since religious groups claim to represent God on Earth and speak on behalf of Him, they are answerable for his actions, and that the Constitution gives him the right to take legal action against them. The Judge agrees, and the court decides to go forward with the case. When Kanji and Mahadev walk out of the courtroom, they are confronted by a large crowd, which is only held back by Police Officers and court guards. Worried about the safety of his family, Kanji tells Mahadev they should split up to go home and check on his wife and kids. However, Kanji soon ends up in front of a group of fundamentalists, who chase him with sticks and daggers. Meanwhile, a handsome stranger  appears at the top of one of Mumbai\'s skyscrapers, wearing a suit and a black overcoat, and twirling a metallic key chain shaped like a small peacock feather on his index finger . The stranger gets on a motorcycle, rides it off the roof, lands on the road without any damage to himself or the bike, and then rescues Kanji Bhai by lifting him up, putting him on the seat behind him and riding away. The assailants follow on their jeeps, but the stranger manages to evade them after an extended chase, by performing some seemingly impossible stunts on his motorcycle. When Kanjibhai asks his name, he identifies himself as "Krishna Vasudev Yadav, from Gokul". He drops Kanji off on a safe street and gives him directions on how to get back home. When Kanji asks if he can give him a lift the rest of the way, he replies that "My job is just to show you the path, you have to walk it yourself." Kanji walks home and discovers that his house has been stoned by a mob, and Susheela is leaving with his children. Though he begs her not to go, and his son refuses to leave his father, Susheela, fearing for the children\'s safety, takes them away to her brother\'s place. Dejected, Kanji sits home drinking alone, when Yadav shows up at the door with a bag, declaring that he is "God" and that "Muslims call me a Prophet, Christians call me Jesus the Messiah, and for you, I am Krishna." However, when Kanji calls Mahadev from next door, Yadav pretends to be normal human being, and produces a document which says that he has purchased the house from Kanji\'s landlord. Yadav says that he is a consultant, and that he will be staying there for a while. He allows Kanji to continue living there, provided he can use Kanji\'s household furniture and kitchen for the duration of his stay. The lawsuit hits all the major news networks and causes a public outcry, with most people berating Kanji bhai and calling him "insane". As Kanji and Yadav watch this from home, Yadav tells Kanji that people are getting a false impression of him, and to rectify that, he needs to talk to the media and tell them what he is trying to accomplish. Kanji bhai appears on a program called "OMG", and explains that his intention is not to insult religion or its beliefs, but to question the ways in which people\'s faith is exploited and commercialied by religious organizations. He also easily puts down several arguments raised by the show\'s audience. The hostess of the show  herself admits that Kanji bhai has changed the way she views Faith. The interview receives widespread coverage, and public opinion swings rapidly in Kanji\'s favour. Meanwhile, hundreds of people, whose insurance claims were rejected because the damages were caused by "Acts Of God" show up at Hanif Qureshi\'s house, asking to join Kanji in his lawsuit. With Muslims and Christians among them, Kanji bhai agrees to plead their cases along with his own, and broadens the lawsuit to include churches and mosques as well. At the next court session, during which Catholic priests and Muslim Mullahs are also summoned to the courtroom as defendants. In the session that follows, the insurance company\'s lawyer points out that Kanji has no way to prove that what happened to him or his fellow plaintiffs were Acts of God, and hence he cannot hold God accountable. Kanjibhai is unable to answer. The Judge declares the court adjourned, then sets the next session for a date one month later, and warns Kanji that he will need irrefutable proof that the disasters were Acts of God, or the case will be dismissed. At the house, Yadav tells Kanji to read the Bhagavad Gita, and that all holy books, such as the Quran and The Bible contain answers for all of his problems. Kanji Bhai studies all three of the Holy texts intensively over the month, during which time Susheela returns to him with their children. At the next session, Kanji points out passages in the holy books which says that all of Creation is God\'s own, and it is his will to allow it to grow or to destroy it. As he is finishing his statement that if this is what religion irrefutably believes, then according to their own sacred texts, God is liable for the damages, Kanji is overcome by a coughing fit and falls over, unconscious. He is rushed to the hospital, where doctors attempt to revive him but are ultimately unsuccessful, leaving him comatose. A while later, Yadav shows up in Kanji\'s hospital room, and places a hand on his forehead. Kanji wakes up, and is told by Yadav that the left side of his body is now paralyed. He then touches Kanji with his keychain, immediately reviving him from his invalid state, and as Kanji rises from the bed, Yadav assumes his true form, revealing to Kanji Bhai that he is Lord Krishna. Kanji asks him why Krishna has chosen to help him - an atheist - and Krishna replies that he shows no favouritism between believers and non believers. As they sit down to talk, Kanji asks God why he created religions, to which Krishna replies that he created man, and man has created religions, and that if one were to attempt to lead them beyond religion, then he would become a religion unto himself. Kanji bhai shows skepticism at this line of thought, and at that point Krishna reveals that Kanji has been in his coma for one month and shows him what has been happening in that time: the lawsuit\'s verdict was in his favour and religious organizations were ordered by court to the pay compensation to all the plaintiffs; and, following that, people have started calling Kanji bhai a "swami" and are singing devotional songs in his name; some have even started calling Kanji the eleventh avatar of Vishnu. Meanwhile, Leeladhar, Gopi Maiyya, and Siddheshwar have opened a new temple in Kanji bhai\'s name, complete with a statue of him, and they have already gotten millions in donations. And today, as per Kanji\'s living will, he is about to be removed from the ventilator, and thousands of people have gathered to accompany his funeral procession. Kanji is appalled by this turn of events, and Krishna, as Yadav, takes him on his motorcycle to the "Kanji Temple" to stop the procession. At the temple, Kanji walks up to the dais and yells at the crowd, pointing out that he had done all of his work to stop events exactly like this, and says that "Our world is beautiful, so why would God stay inside the four walls of a temple? If you want to seek God, then seek Him inside yourself, and not inside some idol made of rock." Kanji then beheads his own statue with a tire iron, and tells the crowd to tear down the temple. As the mob grows unruly, they blame the three pundits for what happened, and attempt to assault them. But Kanji intervenes, and says that their true punishment should be to walk away in shame. As Leeladhar leaves, he stops by Kanji and tells him that faith is like an addiction, and will not let go of people. He gestures toward the crowd and says, "These are not God-loving people, they are God-fearing people," and walks away calmly, implying that he believes they will all return to them someday. Kanji approaches Yadav  to thank him for his help, but is distracted for a second by the crowd, and when he looks back, both Yadav and the motorcycle have disappeared. As he meets his family and they embrace him in reunion, Kanji notices that Yadav\'s key chain has been left behind, and is lying on the ground. He picks it up and is about to secure it inside his jacket when he hears Krishna\'s voice, telling him not to start believing in idol/rock possession  and that he should get rid of the key chain. Kanji Bhai smiles to himself, then throws it away in the sky.'] ["Lum and Abner, from their radio show, have a General Store, which is the centre of life in Pineridge, Arkansas.
