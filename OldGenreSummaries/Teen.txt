Once delivered to the Wessex County Hospital morgue, it turns out that Jason is still alive. He rises, kills the morgue doctor, Axel, by sawing his neck with a bone saw, and then a nurse, Morgan, with a stab to the stomach, and heads back to Crystal Lake. A group of friends Paul, Sam, Sara, Doug, Ted, and Jimmy, have rented a house on Crystal Lake. On the way there, the group passes Mrs. Voorhees' tombstone and a female hitchhiker. After the group drives off the hitchhiker becomes Jason's next victim, stabbed in the throat while eating a banana. Next to the rental house is the Jarvis home. The group meets Trish and Tommy when they arrive. The next day, the group befriends twins Tina and Terri, who live in the area, and they all go skinny dipping at Crystal Point. Trish and Tommy, driving by, stop to see who is at Crystal Point and the group invites Trish to a party that night. Trish's car breaks down a bit further along the road, and they are helped by Rob, a hiker with mysterious reasons for visiting Crystal Lake, who soon becomes good friends with Trish and Tommy. Next door, the kids are enjoying themselves by dancing and listening to music. With four girls and four boys, each now has a date. However conflict ensues as some of the kids switch dates. These conflicts prove to be the least of their troubles as Jason predictably stalks and kills them one by one. Sam goes out skinny dipping and is impaled from under a raft. When Paul goes out to be with her, he is stabbed in the groin. Terri decides to leave early, and is about to get on her bike, but a spear gets rammed into her back. After sleeping with Tina, Jimmy decides to celebrate with a bottle of wine. While searching for a corkscrew, Jason emerges and impales the corkscrew into Jimmy's hand and then drives a meat cleaver into his face. Upstairs, Tina, looks out the window and is grabbed and thrown two stories down, landing on the car. While a stoned Ted watches vintage stag films, he gets too close to the projector screen and is stabbed in the head with a kitchen knife though the screen from the other side. After Doug and Sara finish making love in the shower, Jason attacks Doug, crushing his head against a shower tile. He then kills Sara by driving an ax through the front door when she tries to escape. At the Jarvis house, Trish and Tommy find their mother missing, so Trish goes to Rob for help. Rob explains that he's seeking revenge for the death of his sister, Sandy Dier . Trish and Rob take Gordon, the Jarvis family dog, next door to see what's going on. Tommy is left at home, and finds Rob's newspaper articles about Jason. At the house, a frightened Gordon jumps through a second story window. Jason kills Rob in the basement, and Trish flees back to her home intending to warn Tommy. After a long chase in and between the houses, Tommy shaves his head and makes himself up to look like Jason, which is effective in distracting Jason long enough for Trish to be able to attack him with his machete. She drops the machete as Tommy picks it up and swings it at Jason's head. Jason then falls to the floor, causing the machete to cut further into his head. As he embraces his sister, Tommy sees Jason's fingers begin to move, loses control and begins hacking Jason repeatedly with the machete, while Trish screams his name. The final scene of the film has Tommy visiting Trish in the hospital, and as they embrace and hope their nightmare is over, with a bizarre shot of Tommy psychotically looking towards the camera, kind of like the thousand yard stare.  An alternate ending to the film, included in the 2009 Deluxe Edition DVD, shows a dream sequence where Trish and Tommy wake up the next morning after killing Jason to the sound of police sirens. Trish sends Tommy to summon the police who have arrived next door. At that point she notices water dripping from the ceiling and goes to investigate. She enters the upstairs bathroom, and finds the body of her mother floating in a tub full of bloody water. Trish lifts her mother out of the tub, prompting Mrs. Jarvis' eyes to open, revealing them to be solid white and devoid of irses. Jason suddenly appears from behind the bathroom door and prepares to attack Trish. Trish then suddenly wakes up in the hospital in a scene reminiscent of the ending of the first movie. In his commentary, the director says this scene was cut because it interfered with the idea that this would be the final film."] ['Unable and unwilling to live apart from his girlfriend, Andy  has decided to move from the UK to the United States, so that he can be near Rebecca  while she studies medicine at university.

He and his family live in poverty since his father\'s untimely demise; his mother slaves away in the nightclub of Monti Siracusa, a local mobster boss who runs a city-wide protection racket. Jeremiah gravely contributes to this situation, as he blows the little money Janet makes on alcohol and horse races. Al has to work part-time in an antique shop to support his family as best he can. One day, Al\'s boss brings an old lamp, which a fisherman acquaintance of his has just salvaged from the ocean, to the store and orders Al to polish it. As Al rubs on the lamp, a genie - the very one from Aladdin\'s tale - suddenly appears before him and proclaims him his new master. After recovering from his first shock, Al begins to use the genie\'s power to fulfill some of his most eager wishes: beating up a bully and his gang, winning the affection of Patricia, his long-time crush, and riding in a real Rolls Royce, something his late father had always dreamed of. More importantly, Al begins to view the Genie as a friend and asks him only for his most fondest wishes without overindulging himself. The presence of the Genie and his powers, however, gradually begin to draw in trouble. Patricia\'s father, Sergeant O\'Connor, begins to take an unwelcome interest in the brand-new Rolls Royce cars Al suddenly begins to get out of nowhere; the Genie interferes with Siracusa\'s illicit business, which frustrates the mobster to no end, and is arrested twice for driving without a license, which earns him two temporary stints in prison . In addition, his powers only work during the day, as they have to regenerate overnight, which proves a bit problematic at times, such as when Al is kidnapped by a band of child snatchers and has to wait come morning before the Genie can overcome the gangsters. In due time, the Chief of the Police learns of the Genie\'s mysterious abilities and orders his superintendent to bring the Genie to him. Eventually, Siracusa abducts Janet and Jeremiah and begins to brutally question them about the Genie. Although it is night when Al summons him, the Genie\'s physical strength proves more than enough to finish Siracusa\'s gang by himself, and the gangsters are arrested. Under a false pretense, the Genie is taken away to be dissected, but Al, fearing the worst, finds him before this deed can be executed and manages to convince the Police Chief that he is not an alien but a real-life genie. The Chief then asks Al to have the Genie disable the entire world\'s military arsenal - all except of his own private army, so that he can seize control over the world. The Genie, however, refuses to fulfill this wish, as it would seriously upset the balance of power, and he and Al make their escape on the Chief\'s office carpet converted into a flying carpet. The pair proceeds to the Bermuda Triangle, where the Genie prepares to sink the lamp into the depths of the sea to prevent his powers from being abused. Al, however, unwilling to let his friend go, asks for one final wish, which is fulfilled. With the reward money from Siracusa\'s capture, the Haddins buy the nightclub and celebrate its reopening, with the Genie staying with them as a normal human being.'] ['At seventeen, Veronica "Ronnie" Miller  remains as rebellious as she was the day her parents divorced and her father moved to North Carolina three years prior.

On the day of the tournament, Coach Lumbly of the debate team tells Hal that Ginny has transferred to Townsend Prep for the remainder of her senior year, and that Hal will be paired with Heston for the day. Struggling with his speech and his stutter, Hal calls his therapist, who suggests that he sing his speech or talk with a foreign accent. Hal and Heston finish the day without much success, while Ginny wins a trophy for First Place as an Individual Speaker, which inexplicably goes missing. Coach Lumbly asks Hal to leave the team, telling him that Ginny had never planned to debate as his partner, and had only recruited him as a cruel joke to damage the school\'s chances of winning. He breaks into Earl\'s bedroom and takes a bottle of stolen tequila, then rides with Heston to his friend Lewis\'s house, who lives across the street from Ginny. A drunken Hal drags Lewis\'s mother\'s cello across the street and throws it through Ginny\'s window just as she is arriving home with her new teammate, Ram. Later in the year, Hal\'s mother breaks up with Heston\'s father, and Hal decides to seek out Ginny and return her trophy, which he stole. She rejects his apology, and he travels to Trenton—the "Big City"—to find Ben, Ginny\'s former debate partner. Hal convinces Ben to debate with him and they register as a home-schooled team in the upcoming Policy Debate Championships. In order to overcome his stutter, Ben helps Hal to write his entire speech to the tune of "The Battle Hymn of the Republic". He is interrupted in the middle of his song-speech by Coach Lumbly and a Debate Official, who disqualifies Hal and Ben on the grounds that neither of them is home-schooled and thus would have to be enrolled in a school team. Ben is satisfied with their efforts, but Hal finds Ginny before leaving. He insists that one day will be his day, while she tells him that it was not easy for her to betray him as he walks off. He spends the evening at a nearby beach, and when his father picks him up, Hal tries to tell him his view that life and love "shouldn\'t be rocket science", although he is unable to say the phrase "rocket science" due to his stutter.'] ["Michael Myers, who survived the explosion at the end of Halloween II and has been in a coma since, escapes while being transferred via ambulance between sanitariums, killing the driver and paramedics.

This triggers a landslide, leading to the implosion of the ridge, which Duane and his uncle see from the back of their truck.

Baby is planning to attend Mount Holyoke College to study the economics of underdeveloped countries and then enter the Peace Corps. She was named after Frances Perkins, the first woman in the U.S. Cabinet. Her father, Dr. Jake Houseman , is the personal physician of Max Kellerman , the resort\'s owner. Baby develops a crush on the resort\'s dance instructor Johnny Castle , leader of the working-class entertainment staff. While carrying a watermelon for Billy , Baby is invited to one of the staff\'s secret after-hours parties and observes the "dirty dancing" (i.e., the [[Mambo  for the first time. She is intrigued by the sexy dancing, and receives a brief, impromptu lesson from Johnny. Later, Baby discovers that Johnny\'s dance partner, Penny Johnson , is pregnant by Robbie Gould , a womanizing waiter who dates  Baby\'s sister Lisa. Baby learns that Robbie plans to do nothing about the pregnancy , so Baby secures the money from her father to pay for Penny\'s illegal abortion. Jake agrees to give the money to Baby despite her secrecy regarding what it will be used for, because of the trust Jake has always held in her. In her efforts to help, Baby also becomes Penny\'s substitute dancer for an important performance at the Sheldrake, a nearby resort where Johnny and Penny perform annually. The upcoming show requires Johnny to train Baby to learn the required routine. As Johnny teaches Baby to dance, tempers flare and a romance begins to develop. Their performance at the Sheldrake goes reasonably well, though Baby is too nervous to accomplish the dance\'s climactic lift. When they return to Kellerman\'s, they learn that Penny\'s backstreet abortion was botched, leaving her in agonizing pain. Baby brings her father to help, but he misinterprets Johnny\'s answer to a question he asked while treating Penny, and thus believes it is Johnny who impregnated her. For that reason, after Jake saves Penny\'s life, he forbids Baby to have anything to do with Johnny or his friends. Jake is furious at Baby for lying to him and betraying his trust.

So I\'m gonna do my kind of dancin\' with a great partner, who\'s not only a terrific dancer, but somebody who taught me that there are people willing to stand up for other people no matter what it costs them. Somebody who taught me about the kind of person I want to be: Miss Frances Houseman." At the final talent show of the season, Jake gives Robbie a check to help defray the costs of medical school. Robbie then willingly confesses to getting Penny pregnant and insults her in the process, leading Jake to angrily snatch the envelope back. Also, to everyone\'s surprise, although Johnny\'s been fired and left the premises, he returns to the resort to perform the final dance of the season with Baby. Criticizing the Housemans for their choice of Baby\'s seat at the table, Johnny declares the now-famous line, "Nobody puts Baby in a corner," as he pulls her up from their table. He leads her onstage, interrupting the show which is already in progress. After Johnny makes a brief speech about how "Frances" has made him a better man, he and Baby dazzle the audience with a stunning dance performance to the song "The Time of My Life", which ends with Baby doing the lift successfully for the first time. After the dance, Jake apologizes to Johnny and admits that he was wrong to assume Johnny had gotten Penny "in trouble". Jake also praises Baby for her dancing.

Eric is chosen to be the seeker, and begins to count with his eyes closed as the friends spread out. As he opens his eyes, he sees a masked, knife-wielding man approaching. In fear, he begins to run away, looking back to see the masked man stab one of his friends. He keeps running and slips, impaling himself on protruding bars in the cemetery fence. As he bleeds to death, the friends gather around, with the masked man revealing himself as Bobby, the seventh friend. Their practical joke has gone horribly wrong. Five years later, Michelle testifies at Bobby\'s probation hearing; apparently, Bobby was charged with manslaughter while the other friends were let off. Michelle, Bobby\'s former lover, has organized a reunion of the friends at a campsite near the Placid Pines Cemetery in hopes of bringing closure to the horrific accident that occurred earlier. Bobby is reticent as we learn the status of the other friends, clearly upset at having served time for a joke everyone else was in on. The friends meet up at the campsite , where they are greeted by the cliche-full groundskeeper, Peter Bishop, with whom Michelle strikes a good rapport. Meanwhile, in an isolated shed, we see a bloodied man tied to a chair, awakening only to be brutally hacked to pieces by a masked assailant. The group reunites, with Bobby making his disdain apparent to everyone. The group decides to try to relax until dinner, and it is revealed that Eric\'s family died a short while after Eric\'s death—victims of an arson.

Bobby heads for town and is arrested, as the sheriff is on the lookout for a murderer—a body was located in the woods earlier. Charlie accidentally electrocutes Sarah, and is subsequently bitten in the eye by a rattlesnake planted by the murderer. Peter and Michelle frantically realize they are alone with the killer. The sheriff releases Bobby upon confirming his identity and heads out to scour the woods again. Before Bobby leaves, he sees an incoming fax that reveals the identity of the body found in the woods: Peter Bishop. Back at the camp, "Peter" reveals that he is Adam, Eric\'s brother. A psychopath, he burned down his home, using Eric\'s exhumed body as his own to fake his death. He takes Michelle to the cemetery and tells her to run, much like in the hide-and-seek game in which Eric died. He stalks her, but she is saved by Bobby\'s timely return. Adam is shot, but as the police close in, they are unable to locate his body. Some time later, Bobby and Michelle are escorted into a police car. They sit back, glad to be safe. The driver enters, and we see in the rear-view mirror that he is none other than Adam.'] ["{{Plot}} Set after the events of the original film, Brigitte Fitzgerald  uses an extract of monkshood to fight the effects of the lycanthropy that transformed her sister into a werewolf.

When she goes to check out her books, her library card has too many fines owing, and she walks out, leaving the books behind. Back in her motel room, she inspects her latest cut and records the time and state of healing on a page filled with similar entries. Ginger , her late sister, appears to her as an apparition, saying that she is healing faster and the monkshood is not a cure, it only slows the transformation. Brigitte shoots a deadly second dose of monkshood, and immediately after, Brigitte senses the presence of the male werewolf that has been stalking her, whose identity is unknown. She hastily packs and opens the door to find Jeremy with her library books. However, the additional dose has pushed her into toxic shock.

She does, however, manage to palm a piece of glass so she can continue to measure her healing rate. Tyler ([[Eric Johnson , a worker at the clinic, visits Brigitte at night and offers her some monkshood in exchange for sexual favors. She refuses and he tells her he will not give her the monkshood until she accepts his terms. As Brigitte's healing begins to accelerate, so does her rate of transformation. Ginger continues to appear, taunting Brigitte as she experiences growing cravings for sex, and to kill, as did Ginger previously. During a group therapy session Brigitte daydreams about being instructed to lie on the floor and masturbate, however it is unclear if the masturbation was a fantasy, since the part about imagining death and blood is clearly in Brigitte's mind. Suddenly jolted back to reality by a vision of Ginger, she draws her hand to her face to reveal her palm covered in hair. Later, and very depressed, she takes her shard of glass and holds it to her throat while looking into the bathroom mirror. However, she does not kill herself. During this time, Brigitte is shadowed by a girl called Ghost , the granddaughter of Barbara, a severe burn victim who is a patient there. Ghost eavesdrops on Alice in the staff lounge that Brigitte injects Monkshood. Curious about it, Ghost goes through her clandestinely hidden comic book collection and realizes Brigitte's secret. Ghost slips Brigitte a comic book containing the werewolf story. She begins to question her about lycanthropy, and notices Brigitte's ears have begun to grow pointy, Brigitte takes the glass, telling Ginger that she will not die, and cuts off the pointed part of her ear, flushing it down the toilet. Shortly after, Ghost tries to slip monkshood to Brigitte, but is foiled by Tyler. The following night, in despair at her rate of transformation, Brigitte allows Tyler to inject her. By now, it is apparent the werewolf has found her again. After Ghost's dog is found dead and mutilated, Brigitte asks her where the corpse was found, and is told that it was found in the disused crematorium section of the hospital. Upon learning this, Brigitte says she must get out. Ghost offers to show her an escape route, but insists she be taken with Brigitte. Brigitte escapes to the disused crematorium, in the basement, by crawling through air vents following Ghost's trail marks. There, Brigitte meets Beth-Ann  who is high on drugs that she just received in exchange for sex with Tyler. Beth-Ann is killed and dragged away by the werewolf. Shortly after, Ghost arrives and says the escape route is where Beth-Ann was dragged away to. Brigitte and Ghost proceed, but are separated as the werewolf attacks. Clashing with the beast, Brigitte's leg is broken by the werewolf, but her transformation is so advanced, she heals immediately, and makes her escape after burning the beast in the crematorium. Ghost drives them to a gas station in the clinic car, where Brigitte tends to her wounds. They then drive to Barbara's house and sleep. Ghost explains how Barbara got burned, she tells Brigitte that Barbara fell asleep with her bedtime cigarette. The next day, after Brigitte starts eating a deer caught in an explosion from a trap set up by Ghost, they arrange for Tyler to bring monkshood to the gas station, but when Brigitte wanders inside she discovers the attendant has been slain. While she was away, Tyler had arrived and taken Ghost's car. Brigitte dashes back and drives off. Back at the house, Brigitte's body once more begins to reject the monkshood and Tyler worriedly calls Alice. Ghost tricks Brigitte into thinking Tyler abused her. Brigitte locks Tyler outside, and he is killed by the werewolf. Alice arrives, and is attacked by Ghost, wielding Barbara's hunting rifle. Brigitte figures out that Barbara didn't smoke, she aggressively keeps Ghost against a wall and argues with her, realizing it is likely Tyler didn't abuse Ghost and that Barbara was burnt by Ghost, but is stopped by Alice holding the rifle point-blank to the base of her skull. Alice begins to take Ghost, but is advised not to go outside. The werewolf then howls and breaks a nearby window, and Alice takes Ghost to the attic with her to seek refuge from Brigitte and the werewolf.

They struggle and after she repeatedly bashed its head with a curling stone, they fall into the basement, and the werewolf is killed on a set of mattress springs holding a wide variety of sharp objects. Ghost hits Alice with a hammer and sits at the top of the steps to peer into the basement, gun in hand. A weakend Brigitte crawls up the stairs, her face half transformed, begging Ghost to kill her. Instead, Ghost locks her in the basement. Ghost is shown illustrating a comic page of herself as a powerful warrior with a werewolf pet. Ghost narrates that Brigitte is getting stronger in the basement and is waiting to be unleashed on Ghost's enemies. As the film ends, Ghost is getting ready to welcome home Barbara."] ['Vanessa Lemor, a lonely 13-year old Yup’ik  girl with a vivid imagination, is dumped by her true love, über intellectual Philip Georgey, 14.

After his work is done, Sam asks his mentor to allow the restaurant for him for the night. He allows Sam to have the restaurant to himself for a date with Molly. Peter, who has now been driven paranoid and insane by Candice\'s death, interrupts the date in order to inform them that he nearly pushed a stranger in front of a truck after convincing himself that he would be able to kill someone else in order to take their lifespan; subsequently, he has decided to kill Molly and take her remaining lifespan for himself. After Peter draws a gun and fires shots, Sam and Molly both escape to the restaurant\'s kitchen. Nearby outside, Agent Block overhears the shots and enters the restaurant. He arrives during the confrontation, but is shot and killed by Peter. Believing he is now safe from Death for taking Block\'s lifespan, he decides to kill both Molly and Sam to remove any witnesses. After some struggling, Sam kills Peter with a meat spit before he can harm Molly. Two weeks later, Sam and Molly are boarding a plane to Paris. As they are taking their seats, a fight breaks out between two passengers, revealed to be Carter Horton and Alex Browning, resulting in their removal from the plane with the other passengers. The plane that Sam and Molly are boarding is revealed to be Flight 180. In mid-air, before realizing they are too late to save themselves, both are killed in the resulting accident. Meanwhile, at Roy\'s memorial, Nathan learns from a co-worker, John, that Roy\'s autopsy had revealed that Roy had a brain aneurysm, and that doctors said he would be dead "any day now". As Nathan starts thinking that perhaps he had not saved himself, the landing gear from Flight 180 crashes through the roof of the building and crushes him, setting off the events of the first four films.'] ['{{plot}} The film opens with head girl Justine Fielding  being escorted out of Fairview High School by the police, as other pupils look on. There is then a flashback to five days earlier, where Justine is reading at the funeral of unpopular, asthmatic student Darren Mullet . She starts to talk about him, when Mullet\'s equally unpopular friend, Jason Banks , stands up in church and angrily calls her a hypocrite because she did not really know him. He is then thrown out of church by the sadistic PE teacher. Later on, Justine is talking to her friend Helena  about staying in and watching a Keira Knightley DVD when school heart-throb Alex  decides to invite her to a party that his popular friends, Bradley , Tasha , Khalillah , Sophie , and Marcus , are having. She decides to go to the party, rather than staying in with Helena. At the party, when Justine arrives, Tasha tells Jez , the DJ, to say something about her appearance. He begins to rap about her in an unflattering manner. When Alex tells him to stop, he is literally thrown out of the party by Bradley. Later, Alex and Justine go to one of the bedrooms where Alex he tells her they are on a date, at which point they kiss. Meanwhile, Bradley, Tasha, Khalillah, Marcus and Sophie all receive insulting and degrading text messages from Mullet\'s number. During this, someone puts on a clown costume and grabs a chainsaw, before heading up to the room in which Alex and Justine are kissing. The figure is revealed to be Bradley, who is playing a prank on them. Jez goes to the cemetery to celebrate Mullet\'s death and urinates on his grave . He is then killed by an unseen figure, who stabs him with a cross. Later, the \'in-crowd\' have a toast to Mullet\'s life, and Justine admits that she didn\'t even know who he was. The next day, the group arrives at school, and the headmaster mentions that Jez never came home the night before. Bradley threatens Nasser ([[James Floyd , the leader of the school\'s emo clique, about removing a website he had put up about Mullet. Justine is persuaded to hang around with the popular crowd, and tells Helena that she won\'t be able to make it to her DVD night. She finds a teddy bear  in her locker and assumes it is from Alex. He asks her on another date after this, which she agrees to. She goes to see Jason and he tells her that Mullet was in love with her, and hands her his suicide note. While she is reading the note, a teacher tells her that she will make a great pupil at Oxford University. In the school\'s recording studio, Nasser is then attacked, and sees Mullet\'s ghost. The ghost increases the volume of Nasser\'s music and forces him to listen, rendering him deaf. He is taken to the ambulance, yelling to everyone; "Mullet\'s back!", but no one believes him. Over the course of the day, the gang get more messages, and Bradley believes Jason is sending them. Jason, meanwhile is in art class, and the teacher tells everyone that the guillotine is faulty and they shouldn\'t touch it. A boy sent by Bradley fetches him out of class, and then Bradley and Marcus chase him into the gym, where they give him a wedgie and assault him, but are interrupted by another message, meaning Jason cannot have sent it. The sadistic PE teacher then arrives and unfairly gives Jason detention. Later, Justine confronts Jason about the note, but he denies forging it, and breaks down in tears about the horrific bullying that caused Darren Mullet to kill himself. He tells Justine about the vicious emails and texts sent to Mullet, and also tells her about the website that Bradley\'s gang created about him. When Justine asks who was responsible for Mullet\'s suicide, Jason fearfully glances over at the popular kids she has been hanging out with. She shows Alex the suicide note, but his friends tell her she cannot hand it into the police, because as it accuses Justine of hating him, she would implicate herself in his death. The girls decide that Helena has been sending the messages and attack her in the bathroom, with Tasha smashing her phone. After swim practice, Sophie tells Justine that she should sleep with Alex that night, but goes back into the swimming pool, where she is attacked by Mullet\'s ghost, who throws her into the pool and drags her underwater where she drowns. Later that night, Justine and Alex slept together, but are seen by Mullet who had lovingly brought some flowers for her, who tears the badge from her uniform, and re-arranges her fridge magnets, calling her a "dirty slut just like the others". Marcus is then in PE class, where he sees Mullet\'s ghost, and the teacher tells him to go and have a shower, just as the art teacher arrives and tells the head that they have found Sophie\'s body. In the shower, he is led to a mirror with "moron" on it which Marcus hates being called, then is brutally whipped with a towel by the ghost of Mullet while nude. He manages to fight him off with a cricket bat after painfully popping his bloodied eye back into his skull and heads outside, running into Helena, who accuses him of trying to rape her because he is semi naked. He manages to get outside, and is impaled upon a fence by the ghost. Later on, the gang are at Bradley\'s house, and they have an argument about who killed their friends, ending in Tasha and Justine getting into a fight, and Justine is thrown into the swimming pool. Bradley decides to go and dig Mullet\'s body up at the cemetery to prove that Mullet cannot be responsible for the murders. Justine goes home, and demands that Alex shows her the website, where she tearfully witnesses the diabolical stunts inflicted on Mullet by Bradley and his friends - including Alex . Justine is even more revolted when she realizes that she was rude to Mullet because he interrupted a conversation about her going to Oxford, and ignored his pleas for her to stop the in-crowd torturing him. She tells Alex that he is deceitful and a liar, and that their relationship is over. Tasha becomes drunk in Bradley\'s car as he took her to dig up Mullet. After attempting to dig up Mullet\'s corpse, Bradley breaks down, and begins to cry with grief over the death of his friends. Tasha consoles him, and the two have sex in the back seat of Bradley\'s car. Tasha sees Mullet\'s ghost and tries to get Bradley off her. Despite her desperate attempt to get Bradley\'s attention, Mullet drags Bradley out of the vehicle and rips off his penis  killing Bradley due to blood loss. Tasha gets free and runs into an open grave. She explains that she lied to Mullet, telling that she loved him ever since they met each other. Mullet stands behind her with a shovel and decapitates her. The next day, she arrives at the art class, where Jason has painted Munch\'s "The Scream" painting, and tells him that she was responsible for Mullet\'s death. He tells her that it has been his fault, because he was scared of being bullied, so he told Bradley that Mullet fancied her. She leaves the room, and Mullet appears, and kills him by jamming two pencils up his nose and slamming his head against the table. Justine approaches Helena and tells her that she is sorry, that her friends, including Alex were all horrible. Khalillah runs over and asks her where Tasha is, but Justine tells her she doesn\'t care. Khalillah then gets a text message from Tasha telling her to meet her in the art room. Before Justine can follow, she is confronted by Alex, who tells her he is going to kill Mullet for what he has done to everyone. Justine tells him that Khalilah is in danger. Khalillah gets to the empty art room, and sees "The Scream" with her name on it, at which point Mullet puts a plastic bag over her head, before using the guillotine to slice her hands off. She tries to call the head teacher, but he is too busy with the police, who tell him that Justine\'s badge has been found near the bodies of Bradley and Tasha. They get to the art room, and find Jason\'s and Khalillah\'s bodies, but are attacked by Mullet. They break free, by stabbing him in the stomach with a screwdriver and head to the common room, where Mullet follows them. Alex tries to stop him, but is stabbed in the hand with the screwdriver and his hand is tightly nailed in the floor. Justine gets him to stop, but he begins to choke her to death. She grabs his inhaler and throws it across the room, telling Alex to smash it. He does, and the ghost begins to die. Justine tells Alex to leave, but he starts being a bully again and punches Mullet, knocking a sofa over, and finding Mullet\'s other inhaler which Alex had hidden from Mullet when he was alive. Mullet then uses it and then stabs Alex in the throat with the screwdriver. Mullet flees just as the police arrive. Justine is then led out and into the police car seen earlier, having been arrested for the murders. She sees Mullet\'s ghost but then it disappears, what happened next to her is never revealed. During the credits, there is a sequence where the foul-mouthed PE teacher is telling students off, and Mullet is shown getting ready for revenge on him.'] ['In 1995 four childhood friends — Samantha Albertson, the "weird" girl who likes performing seances and whose parents are divorcing ; Roberta Martin, a tough tomboy whose mother died when she was four; Chrissy DeWitt, a naive girl who is sheltered by her mother; and Tina "Teeny" Tercell, an outgoing girl who dreams of being famous -- reunite in their hometown of Shelby, Indiana. Chrissy is revealed to be living in her childhood home with her nerdy husband, Morton, pregnant with their first child and due to give birth any day. Teeny is now a Hollywood actress who has been married three times. Roberta is now a doctor and is living "in sin" with her boyfriend. Sam is now a science-fiction author and also serves as the narrator of the story. The girls are in Chrissy\'s backyard, reminiscing about the summer of 1970. Teeny and Samantha have not been back to their hometown in ten years. The story returns to the early summer of 1970 and the girls have one goal: to obtain the money needed to buy a tree house. While saving money for the tree house and avoiding the Wormers, four brothers who torment them at every chance, they sneak out one night to the local graveyard to perform a seance. To their surprise, they find a tombstone cracked down the middle, leading them to believe they resurrected the spirit of a young boy named "Dear" Johnny. The local library has no information on him, so the girls head to a town farther away by biking. Chrissy insists that they take a break. The girls rest under a tree, and a bird drops its feces onto Chrissy\'s head causing them to go to the lake to wash her hair out, which leads to them playing in the lake splashing each other. Roberta jumps from a tree into the lake and floats back up to the surface seemingly drowned, freaking the girls out and trying to decide who should give her mouth-to-mouth. Chrissy hastily says she will but before she can, Roberta spits up water into her face revealing it all to have been a joke, but Chrissy hits her in the face demanding that she "never scare her like that again", and the two chat with Roberta apologizing for what she did and Chrissy stating that Roberta is her best friend. They then see the Wormer boys skinny dipping in the lake not too far away. They make a big deal talking about Scott\'s penis and the size and talk about erections. They then decide to get back at the Wormers for an earlier prank by taking all of their clothes that are stashed on their bikes by the lake. They get the boys attention by showing they have their clothes and run off on their bikes making the boys chase them naked as they throw their clothes one by one onto the dirt road as they ride off. They then reach the next town\'s library. Roberta comes across an article concerning her mother\'s death, which reveals that she died in a car accident. Samantha then finds some information on Dear Johnny, including that he and his mother died together in a tragic accident. Before they find out more, they see that the rest of the article was torn out of the book, indicating that someone wants to keep his death a mystery. On the way home, they encounter a returning soldier from the Vietnam War, who they sit and talk to, and also gives them a pessimistic view of the war\'s progress. The next day, they visit Wiladine, a self-proclaimed psychic, to find out more on Dear Johnny. Using tarot cards, she determines that he was murdered. Afterward they hear about a softball game being played and head to the field. While the other three watch, Roberta steps up to bat, but hits a foul ball, which prompts Jimmy, the local bully, to declare that girls can\'t play softball. She walks up to him and punches him in the face, knocking him to the ground, and continues beating him. Samantha, Teeny, and Chrissy break up the fight, but Jimmy insults Roberta\'s mother\'s death, which causes Samantha to jump at him and beat him. When she gets home, she meets Bud Kent, a man her mother is having over for dinner. She dislikes him immediately and is cold towards him. Bud spills his drink on himself and takes off his jacket, while her mother gives him her father\'s shirt. She promptly storms out. Teeny is seen watching Love Story at a drive-in movie from the roof of her house when Samantha shows up. They decide to go to the store and hang out in the display model of the tree house. Roberta is playing basketball alone in her driveway when Scott Wormer suddenly shows up. They play for a minute and then sit on an outdoor bench by her house. They both question why they fight all the time and share a kiss. After a moment of silence, she warns him, "If you mention this to anyone, especially your brothers, I\'ll beat the shit out of you." At the tree house, Samantha and Teeny are playing Truth or Dare when Samantha suddenly tells her that her parents are divorcing, to her surprise. She talks about her desire to have a normal family, and starts crying. Teeny comforts her, saying that there is no such thing as a normal family. She then bites her favorite necklace in half and gives one half to her, as a "best friends for life" bracelet. It starts to rain so they leave the store. As they\'re riding their bikes, Samantha realizes that her bracelet fell off, and they stop to look for it. Teeny sees it in a storm drain, and Samantha reaches for it. Just as she gets her fingers around it, it slips farther into the drain. She climbs down there to retrieve it, and then the water rises and she begins to drown. Teeny attempts to pull her up, but can\'t reach her. Just as the situation seems hopeless, Crazy Pete, an old vagrant, sees what\'s going on, and jumps in after her. He successfully pulls her out and the girls thank him and see him in a new light, knowing that she would have perished had he not been there. The next day, all four girls are painting Roberta\'s garage. The Wormers pass by, and while most of them ignore them, Scott, in an out of character gesture, politely greets them, while looking specifically at Roberta. As the Wormers are walking away, the girls ridicule Scott, while Roberta says that he\'s not so bad. Later, they visit Samantha\'s grandmother, and ask her about Dear Johnny. She refuses to tell them, however, saying that it would be too much for them. Just then, her poker buddies show up to get her. She then rushes the girls to get out of the house, and leaves for her tournament. Instead of leaving, they sneak into the attic from the window and search for any more information regarding Dear Johnny\'s death. They eventually find a newspaper with the headline "Murders Stun Town", proving that he and his mother were indeed murdered. This revelation shocks all four of them as they realize that even their seemingly safe town can be dangerous. Roberta then flies into a rage, appalled that two innocent people were murdered in cold blood and the realization that her mother died painfully, despite her father\'s claims. Samantha then finally tells the others that her parents are getting a divorce. They then make a pact to always be there for one another, no matter what. They then go back to the cemetery to perform another seance to put Dear Johnny\'s soul to rest. His tombstone then rises in the air with a bright light surrounding it, frightening them. A figure appears in the light before revealing itself to be just a handyman. He explains that he accidentally cracked the tombstone with his tractor and they realize that they fooled themselves into believing that they resurrected Dear Johnny. From then on they decide to quit performing the seances, deeming them a waste of time. As they\'re leaving, they see Crazy Pete in the cemetery. The others leave while Samantha stays behind and follows him to Dear Johnny\'s new tombstone. She then comes to the conclusion that he is in fact Peter Simms, his father. She comforts him, while he tells her not to dwell on things in life. The two then go their separate ways. Some time after, the tree house is bought, and Samantha gives a narration: "We all used to try so hard to fit in. We wanted to look exactly alike, do all the same things, practically be the same people. And when we weren\'t looking, that changed. The tree house was supposed to bring us more independence. But what the summer actually brought was independence from each other." The film then jumps back to 1995, and Chrissy is in labor. They take Teeny\'s limo to the hospital, where Roberta delivers the baby, which is a girl. Morton arrives just then to meet his new daughter. Later, the ladies are in their tree house with the baby, playing Truth or Dare. After that and a deep conversation on how happy they are in life, they make another pact to visit more often. They see a group of kids playing Red Rover and join the game. The films ends with one final narration from Samantha: "You can run from the disappointments you\'re trying to forget but it\'s only when you embrace your past that you truly move forward. Maybe Thomas Wolfe never got to go home again but I found my way there, and I\'m glad I did."'] ["The film opens with a parody of The Exorcist, during which teenager Megan Voorhees  becomes possessed by the spirit of Hugh Kane, the previous owner of the House.

It smells the fear of the nearby teen, preparing to go after him; however, it finds it\'s missing both wings, along with an arm and leg. It "leap frogs" after the teen, pouncing on him. As the Creeper is about to eat the teen to replace his lost limbs, Jack Sr. shoots the Creeper in the head. The Creeper is unable to defend itself as Jack Sr. stabs it in the heart 31 times with a harpoon. The Creeper apparently succumbs to its wounds, with its "face wings" closing over its entire face. Minxie explains that the Creeper didn\'t die; its time ran out, so the Creeper is in hibernating until another 23 Springs pass. A skeptical Jack Sr. stabs the Creeper once more and, upon seeing no reaction, believes that Minxie is wrong: "Looks dead to me." Over the next 23 years, Jack Sr. has stitched together the damaged corpse of the Creeper and presents it as a roadside tourist attraction. People come from all over the area to pay $5 and see the legendary "Bat Out of Hell", paying $10 for a picture; crows are still attracted to the monster. The harpoon gun, always loaded and ready to fire, is aimed at the creature\'s chest.

Kristen has managed to make some new friends: Alice Johnson , a young, bright girl and a frequent daydreamer; Sheila Kopecky , a brainy, quiet girl with asthma; and Debbie Stevens , a tough girl who hates bugs. She has also found herself a boyfriend, Rick , a martial arts enthusiast who is also Alice's brother. Kristen begins to have bad dreams and feels as though Freddy has once again come back from the dead. During one of her nightmares, she pulls Kincaid and Joey into her dream as she explores the deserted Elm Street house. The boys try to convince her that Freddy has not come back, and puts her hand on one of the furnaces, showing that the boiler room is empty and cold. Kincaid's dog Jason then jumps out of the boiler and bites Kristen's arm. Kristen wakes up and discovers the bite marks on her arm; while Kincaid wakes up and sees blood dripping from Jason's mouth. In school the next day, Kincaid and Joey confront Kristen about pulling them into the dream. Kincaid wakes up one night and finds himself locked in the trunk of an old junked car. When he opens the hood, he realizes that he is in the same salvage yard that Freddy's body was buried in. Kincaid spies his dog, Jason, digging and urinating fire in the ground nearby. Freddy then resurrects from the ground and goes after Kincaid. After Kincaid unsuccssessfully tries to kill him by knocking a pile of junked cars down on him, Freddy traps and kills Kincaid. Later that night, Joey finds a naked woman swimming in his water bed, but Freddy bursts out seconds later and kills him. The following day at school, Kristen is concerned when her friends fail to show up for class. She confides to Alice about nightmares. Kristen hits her head and passes out when she discovers both of her friends were killed, being attacked by Freddy but revived in time. After she learns of the deaths of Kincaid and Joey, Kristen goes to the actual Elm Street house, with Rick, Dan, and Alice. Rick tells Dan the story of Freddy, and Alice reveals a part of a rhyme by the name of The Dream Master. Alice suggests to Kristen that she is in control of her own dreams. However, Alice also looks down at the ground and sees something, a sidewalk chalk drawing of the house, that only Kristen has been able to see. Clearly, she senses something. At home that night, her mother secretly slips a sedative into her drink to forcibly put her to sleep. Kristen replies angrily to this, and runs upstairs in fear. She quickly falls asleep. On Alice's advice, she tries to convert nightmares into pleasant dreams. At first this works, and she proceeds to dream about a sandy beach vacation spot. While she meets a child named Alice creating a sand castle in her dream, Freddy appears and ruins everything, eventually taking Kristen to his boiler room. It is explained that Kristen is the last child from Elm Street, and Freddy needs her help to get more children. Freddy taunts her long enough to make her scream for Alice. Alice appears suddenly in the boiler room and Kristen tries to get her to wake up but to no avail. Krueger attempts to kill Kristen's friend in front of her, but she jumps in front of Alice, and Freddy throws Kristen into a furnace and collects her soul along with the other Dream Warriors. Before Kristen dies, she sends her power to pull people into her dreams, to Alice's body. Alice awakens immediately, realizing that Kristen is in danger, and she and Rick both quickly make their way to Kristen's house. Outside, they see flames coming from Kristen's room, and they are too late to save her. As Alice tries to understand what has happened, and exactly who Freddy is, her friends begin to die. The next day at school, while taking a test, Alice falls asleep in class and accidentally pulls Sheila into her dream where Freddy is waiting. He traps Alice in her desk chair so she cannot help her friend and torments and taunts Sheila before sucking all the air out of her mouth. Alice awakens, only to discover Sheila having an asthma attack. Sheila then dies after her inhaler ultimately fails. Later, Rick finds himself fighting an invisible Freddy and seems to win when he knocks his glove off. The glove stirs and soon launches at Rick and stabs him in the stomach. After every death, including Kristen's, Alice picks up new talents and traces of the former owner's personality. She also picks up the dream powers of the children who have died. She is obviously Freddy's supernatural opposite, albeit too weak to truly conquer or even resist him yet. After Rick's funeral, Alice teams up with Dan Jordan, who was one of Rick's closest friends. Together with Dan, Alice tries to get to Debbie, their last surviving friend, before Freddy finds her. Unbeknown to the two teens, Freddy is able to control their movements. Trapping Alice and Dan in a time loop, Freddy is able to reach Debbie and kill her by transforming her into a cockroach and trapping her inside a roach motel and then crushing her before Alice and Dan can intervene. Following a car accident, where Dan is injured and rushed to the hospital, Alice returns home to prepare for one final battle with Freddy. Alice goes to sleep to help Dan before Freddy can kill him. As Alice and Dan search for Freddy, Dan is injured and right at the moment the doctors wake Dan and he is pulled from the Dream World. Alice, facing Freddy alone, attempts to use all of her newly absorbed abilities against him. The fight is relatively equal, except that she has a mortal body and he does not, giving him the advantage of immortality. It is an advantage that proves nearly too great to overcome. He declares that he has been guarding his gate for too long to be taken down by her. But just as he is preparing to kill her, she recalls the final verse of the Dream Master rhyme. For the first and only time, someone defeats Freddy, by using the power of the spell to make him see the evil that is inside. Using her power as guardian of the gate of good dreams, Alice releases the tortured souls that Freddy imprisoned into the gates of good dreams where he can no longer harm them. Krueger's clothes fall lifelessly to the floor and Alice kicks his glove. The film ends with Dan and Alice at a fountain some time later. Dan tosses a coin into a fountain and before the coin falls into the water, Alice briefly sees the reflection of Freddy appear, Alice brushes this off and she and Dan walk through the park."] ['The plot was described by the author and numerous critics as a teen installment to a Jackie Chan plot with a Disney twist. Gary Marsh called the film "Buffy the Vampire Slayer meets Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon".Marissa Guthrie . I was a teenage \'warrior\'. New York Daily News. Accessed 2008-11-11. Wendy Wu  is an average, popular American teenager whose life is turned upside down by a visit from a young Buddhist monk Shen . Shen claims Wendy is the reincarnation of an all-powerful almighty female warrior and the only one who can prevent an ancient evil spirit from destroying the world. He then pleads Wendy to wear an incredibly strong and powerful amulet that will protect her from evil until he can fully train her in martial arts. Appalled by Shen\'s obvious lack of fashion sense - he usually wears a traditional monk\'s robe - Wendy pays little attention to him. She is too busy campaigning for Homecoming Queen against her school arch rival, Jessica Dawson, to be bothered with rescuing civilization. Wendy\'s traditional grandmother knows that Shen is speaking the truth; her mother  was the previous Yin Warrior who ninety years earlier defeated Yan-Lo in China. However, the others in Wendy\'s family have lost touch with their Chinese heritage. Shen\'s discussion of Chinese culture inspire Wendy\'s mother, a researcher at Fair Springs National History Museum, and Shen\'s mooncakes do the same for Wendy\'s father. However, faced with the choice between fighting evil and going shopping, Wendy is off to the mall in a heartbeat with her best friends Tory and Lisa. Yan-Lo soon materializes and sets out to destroy Wendy before she can attain her full Yin Warrior powers and abilities. In quick succession, the dark spirit possesses a security guard at the museum, Wendy\'s brother, her principal, her dog, her teachers, her best friend Tory and even  Jessica Dawson. Wendy breaks up with her boyfriend, Austin after noticing how much of a jerk he is and starts to bond more with Shen. With Shen\'s help, her teachers are transformed into the souls of the Five Animals of Chinese martial arts to help teach Wendy. Mr. Medina becomes the Tiger, Coach Gibbs becomes the Snake, Mr. Tobias becomes the Crane, Mr. Garibay becomes the Leopard, and Shen himself becomes the Dragon. The martial arts training unleashes Wendy\'s inner heroine for a final showdown with Yan-Lo during Homecoming. In the last scene, Jessica thanks Wendy for lending her the Homecoming crown and the Queen status, opposing her usual hostile approach towards Wendy and the conflict between the two is apparently put to rest. Yan Lo then returns, choosing to this time appear in person, and the battle continues. Shen begins to sacrifice himself, his destiny, but Wendy saves him by changing his destiny. Wendy and Shen both kick Yan Lo together, and Yan Lo is destroyed forever. The monks tell Shen this is his last life, and the monks leave. At the end, Wendy and Shen leave to get the cappucinos and chocolate that Shen said he loves earlier in the movie, hinting that they might begin dating.'] ['When shy and introspective Mary arrives as a new student at an all-girls boarding school, she shares a dorm room with Paulie and Victoria .

At first, she thinks that they are practicing kissing in order to prepare themselves for kissing males. She then realises the nature of their romance. This also manifests itself in Paulie coming to Torie\'s rescue. For example, Paulie defends Victoria from a frustrated math teacher who unintentionally humiliates her when she does not understand a mathematical equation. Over time, Paulie and Tori become more comfortable showing affection in front of Mary. It progresses from a quick kiss on the lips in front of her to the two sharing a bed while they think Mary is sleeping. At first, Mary is shy about sharing a room with the two lovers and feels like an intruder. After a few days, she finds their kissing and murmuring comforting and familiar. When the three are running one day, Paulie comes across a hurt falcon, which she befriends. After reading up on falcons, she trains the animal and becomes obsessed with caring for it as she believes that something untoward has happened to its parents.

One of the boys, Jake, flirts with Tori, asking if she will be attending her brother\'s 18th birthday party and making it clear that he is interested in her. When Mary and Tori are alone, Tori expresses disgust at the boy\'s interest in her, saying, "He liked my tits." When Mary asks if she\'ll go to the party, Tori says, "And have all those gross guys groping me? No, thanks. I\'d rather stay home and do math." One morning, Victoria\'s sister, Allison , and her friends rush into the room to wake up the older girls. Paulie is lying in Tori\'s bed, both naked. Allison and the other girls are shocked. Mary pushes Tori\'s sister out of the room and closes the door. After the younger girls leave, Tori, her head in her hands, decides at that moment to end whatever intimate relationship she had with Paulie, who claims that she loves her. Tori refuses outright, saying, \'No! You don\'t know Allison. She\'ll get hysterical and tell my dad.\' Tori then angrily tells Paulie to get out of her bed. Paulie tries to downplay the situation, and Tori tells her she does not understand, explaining that her sister will tell her parents about it. When confronted by Allison, Tori tries to extinguish her sister\'s suspicions by telling her Paulie has an unrequited crush on her and crawled into her bed. Her sister promises to "fix" the rumors about Tori and not tell their parents anything. As she walks away from this conversation, Victoria collapses into tears. In the library, Victoria explains to Mary that her family, her parents and her sister, are strongly opposed to homosexuality, and she must stop the relationship to prevent their rejection.

Paulie degenerates into psychotic behavior over Tori\'s withdrawal from the relationship. She smashes a mirror and hurls a dish cart to the ground and begins to act out in other ways. A rejection letter from the agency that handled Paulie\'s adoption, which informs her that her birth mother denied a request from Paulie to get in touch, further sends her over the edge.

Mary runs to Victoria\'s soccer match, where the headmistress, math teacher and fellow students are congregated. Upon reaching the group, Mary sees Paulie, sobbing from the top of a building while holding her falcon.

The two girls then choose "targets", or guys they want to be the ones they lose their virginity with. Unbeknownst to the adults, all the girls in camp bet money on the contest and divide into two "teams," each rooting for and egging on either Ferris  or Angel . At the same time, the girls engage in typical teenage behavior, such as food fights and other activities. The girls involved in the contest are opposites and rivals: cynical, suspicious and streetwise poor girl Angel Bright and romantic rich girl Ferris Whitney. Both girls discover that "it" is not what they thought it was. Ferris thinks of love as romance and wine and flowers. She imagines herself swept off her feet by Gary, the camp counselor. When she lies about "making love" with him, the biological side manifests itself in others\' reactions to what she said she did. She discovers that, at least in the context of a camp counselor having sex with a fifteen year-old, sex can be hurtful and its consequences ugly. Her attitude is now more grounded in reality; she has become more like street-wise Angel. Angel approaches the same issue from the other side. She views winning the contest as a mechanical, purely biological function, "no big deal" as her mother has told her. But when she tries to do "it" with Randy  in the boathouse, she becomes confused by feelings she did not know she had. She behaves very defensively, as if Randy is trying to force her to have sex. Randy, who could take it or leave it, is put off by her recalcitrance and leaves. She then must admit to herself that sex is not a mechanical function she can cynically turn on and off, but is something she deeply wants to do. Angel reconnects with Randy later with a much improved attitude, one closer to Ferris\'. This time she pays attention not to clothing removal procedures and condoms, but to her feelings for Randy. In the end, Ferris discovers that love involves sex, which is not always romantic, and Angel discovers that sex involves love, which deeply touches her and transforms her soul. They both grow up that summer.'] ['Terri Griffith  is an aspiring teenage journalist living in Tucson, Arizona who feels that teachers don\'t take her school newspaper articles seriously because of her good looks.

Carson\'s friends return to her room, but find both her and the Spirit Stick missing. They search for her, eventually finding her dancing with Penn. At this time Brooke and her friends also see the duo. When the Sharks reveal that the Spirit Stick is gone, Carson accuses the Jets of sending Penn to lure her away, and she angrily announces to all, Penn\'s secret. The Sharks are worried, because losing the Spirit Stick means they are "cursed." The Sharks decided to hold a ceremony to ask the "Cheer Gods" for forgiveness. They are interrupted when the Jets arrive, and the squads have a "cheer-rumble" . The authorities arrive, and in the ensuing melee, a number of members from both teams become injured. Both squads are forced to leave the camp as neither one has enough members to compete. But before they can board their respective buses, Carson suggests to Brooke that they combine into a single squad to compete at the Cheer Camp Championship. Though reluctant at first, the squads come together as the "East-West Coast Shets," complete with new uniforms made through patching their old uniforms together. The two teams slowly bond, while Carson works on repairing her relationship with Penn. The Shets sneak into Camp Victory, the rival of Camp Spirit-Thunder, to scope Camp Victory\'s star team, the Flamingos. After seeing their impressive performance, Carson devises a new routine, inspired by the Double Dragon ride at that amusement park. On the day of the competition, the Shets perform their routine perfectly, winning the competition outright. Carson and Penn kiss on the mat in the middle of the celebrations, and it is revealed that Camp Victory are the ones responsible for stealing the Spirit Stick. The end credits feature clips of the cast dancing "all over the world", while the singer Ashley Tisdale, who is the sister of Jennifer Tisdale, performs her single "He Said She Said."'] ["Summer is over and 16-year-old Chris , who is constantly bullied, is enrolling in a new high school.

The Alpha Betas are now respectful of the nerds\' prominence and even wish they could get more nerds to join their frat. However, this changes when Orrin Price , becomes a member of the Adams College Board of Regents and a new generation of jocks come to campus, including Orrin\'s obnoxious son and a brain-dead jock named Bobo. Stan Gable is now a pathetic motorcycle police officer whom Orrin Price implausibly installs as the new Dean of Students. Gable and Price rally the ABs to cause trouble for the nerds, whose group now includes an obese English inductee  and a Korean Elvis impersonator . Early anti-nerd actions include the vandalizing of the Computer Science Center and a raid that ruins the Tri-Lamb new membership party. Lewis, who lives near the Adams College campus and chairs Adams\' Computer Science Department, shows that he is distancing himself from his nerd past by growing a ponytail and asking people to call him "Lou" rather than Lewis. His nephew Harold, who is now a student at Adams, is surprised at Lewis\' behavior, saying in his college day he was the "George Washington of nerds". Betty, who is now married to Lewis and is also a professor at Adams College , tries to remind him she fell in love with him because he had the courage to be himself, but Lewis is more interested in becoming friends with new Dean Gable . When Stan and the Alpha Betas launch a reign of terror against the nerds, Lewis is forced to examine his "self-hating nerd" status, while Stan faces his own stirrings of conscience over the vile actions of Orrin Price and has to decide what he will and will not stand for. The film reaches its climax when Lewis, finally unable to ignore Orrin Price\'s reign of terror over Adams College, decides to take action. Orrin Price has framed the Tri-Lambs by planting marijuana in their house. Lewis reaches out to Stan to help defend the Tri-Lams, but Stan says he will not help. Lewis angrily tells Stan that he was forgiving of their rocky past and defended Stan as a friend when others were telling Lewis he should ditch Stan. Stan then says that he is not friends with Lewis, and that Lewis will be a nerd for life so matter what his behavior. This betrayal spurs Lewis to once again embrace his nerd self. Lewis arranges for bail for the arrested Tri-Lams, putting his house up as collateral. He then calls upon all the nerds and those sympathetic to their cause on campus and in the city to participate in a massive nerd strike, meaning to take it easy and stop working. Many of the city\'s basic utilities and services are crippled. In order to end the strike, Price decides to frame Lewis for embezzling college funds, a tactic Stan is uncomfortable with. Lewis is arrested and the strikers return to work. Betty confronts Stan to tell the truth and get Lewis released. Stan suggests he would do it if she were to offer herself, when Betty asks if that is what he really wants, Stan looks deeply ashamed as he says he does not want that—he still has a little bit of pride left. At trial, things do not look good for Lewis until most of his old Tri-Lamb friends return to support him. Stan, realizing that his miserable life stems from his refusal to admit his own mistakes , has a change of heart and testifies against Price, admitting that he has proof that Orrin Price planted the marijuana plants in the Tri-Lam house. Stan also states that he is a nerd; that he always wanted to read books but his family discouraged it. Price is arrested and the charges against Lewis are dismissed. Stan feels it ought to be best to resign as dean of student because he feels he cannot cut it, but Lewis argues he should stay on. The nerds accept Stan as one of their own, guaranteeing nerd freedom in Adams College.'] ['The Wildcats were trailing the West High Knights, and the Wildcats enter the locker room for the final period feeling bitter.

Ten year-old Tina Shepard  hears her alcoholic father physically abusing her mother at their lake house. The emotional trauma unlocks Tina\'s previously latent telekinetic powers, which causes the boating dock to collapse, drowning him in Crystal Lake. Ten years later, Tina  is still struggling with guilt and has lived in a series of mental institutions ever since. Her mother, Amanda Shepard , and her therapist, Dr. Crews  convene at the lake house for a field session. Unbeknownst to them, Dr. Crews actually intends to exploit Tina\'s anguish to study her abilities; because Tina\'s powers lash out under extreme duress, Crews continually needles her to keep her stress levels high. Despite her suspicions of his true intentions, Tina begrudgingly cooperates with the tests. Meanwhile, several teenagers are residing in the neighboring vacation home to surprise their friend Michael for his birthday. Despite their friendship with Michael, most do not get long with each other: a bookworm named Maddy, the perky Robin, inept science-fiction writer Eddie, a stoner named David, an uptight Ivy League student named Russel and his girlfriend Sandra, Ben with his girlfriend Kate, and a snobbish socialite named Melissa. Michael\'s cousin Nick  is smitten by Tina and attempts to befriend her, much to Melissa\'s chagrin. Tina, eager to forge normal relationships with her peers, attempts to make friends with the others, with mixed results. After a particularly stressful session with Dr. Crews, Tina flees the house to the dock to grieve and senses the presence of Jason\'s severely decayed body in the lake. Mistaking it for her father, she focuses her powers and inadvertently resurrects Jason and frees him. Tina faints upon seeing him, and he swims to shore unobserved; upon hearing the story, Crews dismisses the incident as a hallucination. Michael\'s car breaks down en route to the cabin and are killed when Jason comes across them; he later kills another couple at their campsite. Tina has a vision of Michael\'s death and discovers the tent spike used to kill them embedded in the porch door; when she tries to show Crews the evidence she finds it missing and doubts her sanity.

He returns to find that Mrs. Shepard has read his notes and discovered his motives. Desperate to get away, Crews cancels the trip and intends to take Tina back to have her committed and drugged.

Nick runs next door to warn his friends, but finds them all dead, and Tina runs to the woods to find her mother, unaware that Jason has killed both her and Dr. Crews. She finds Jason\'s victims strewn across the woods, including the body of her mother. Tina returns to the vacation cabin and finds Jason waiting for her. Distraught over the events, she focuses her rage and attacks Jason with her powers.

Eventually Tina collapses the porch roof on Jason and assumes him dead. She returns to the lake house to find Nick and Melissa. Melissa is unnerved by their stories and storms out of the house, but as she opens the door, Jason kills her with an axe and pursues Nick and Tina through the house. Tina fights back, eventually splitting his mask in half and throwing him into the basement, where she uses her powers to immolate him. The fire grows out of control and Nick rescues her. They escape the house to the dock just as the house explodes. Jason survives the blast and attacks them, knocking Nick unconscious and incapacitating Tina. In a last, desperate effort, Tina reaches out with her mind as before. Her resurrected father bursts through the dock and wraps Jason\'s old chains around his neck and drags him into the lake, ultimately drowning him. The following morning, firefighters douse the remaining blaze and find Jason\'s mask. Nick wakes up in an ambulance next to Tina and anxiously asks about Jason. Tina tells him that "we took care of him" as the ambulance drives off to town.

An adolescent boy, known as Bunny Boy, wears only pink bunny ears, shorts and tennis shoes on an overpass in the rain. A cat is carried by the scruff of its neck by a teenage boy. He drowns the cat in a barrel of water. The film then cuts to a different scene with the same boy Tummler, in a wrecked car with a girl. They fondle each other, and Tummler realizes there is a lump in one of the girl\'s breasts. Tummler and Solomon then ride down a hill on bikes. The narrator introduces Tummler as a boy with "a marvelous persona", whom some people call "downright evil". Later, Tummler aims an air rifle at a cat. His friend Solomon stops him from killing the cat, protesting that it is a house cat. They leave and the camera follows the cat to its owners\' house.

This leads to the opening credits and shows a montage of the two together. While at breakfast one morning, Gidget\'s father Russ  announces that they are going to vacation in Hawaii. Gidget, unlike most girls, hates surprises and wishes he had told her sooner, so they could have delayed the trip. Gidget refuses to go, and runs out the door. Gidget\'s mother Dorothy , explains to her husband that Jeff is all that matters to Gidget. Russ and Dorothy decide to cancel Gidget\'s room reservation and keep one just for the two of them, so they can have a second honeymoon and Gidget can stay home with Jeff. Meanwhile Gidget goes to the beach, and tells Moondoggie about going to Hawaii. Jeff thinks it\'s great and says she should go. Gidget is surprised by this response and thinks that their relationship means nothing to Jeff. She returns his pin and runs off, leaving an upset, confused and frustrated Moondoggie on the beach. She also decides to go to Hawaii to forget about Jeff. So the Lawrence family packs up and flies to Hawaii. While on the plane Gidget meets Abby Stewart  whose family is staying at the same hotel.

They both learn that Eddie Horner  a popular dancer is performing at a theater–restaurant next to their hotel. They also meet three more men named Judge , Larry , and Wally . Abby enjoys the fact that they will all be at the same hotel but Gidget barely reacts. Abby figures out that Gidget has just broken up and asks her to tell the story. Gidget does, but in an overly dramatic way. She says it was love at first sight . She then goes on to say that she went overboard and "surrendered herself completely," which Abby interprets to mean that she went all the way. Gidget then tells Abby that she used to call him "Moondoggie" which Abby finds very strange as well.

Once Jeff learns this he immediately accepts. That night Abby visits Gidget, and invites her to dine with Eddie, Judge, Larry and Wally and Herself. Abby decided to go with all of them, because she didn\'t want to choose. Gidget declines and says she\'d be happier if she stayed in her room. Once Abby leaves, Gidget\'s mom enters and says she feels bad but Gidget should enjoy her time there and have fun with Abby and the boys . Gidget agrees and says she\'ll be there soon. While at the restaurant, Abby is annoyed that she can\'t be alone with Eddie, so she finds two other girls named Barbara Jo and DeeDee to accompany them. Once they are there Abby gets to talk to Eddie alone while Wally, Judge and Larry argue over Barbara Jo and DeeDee. Meanwhile Gidget\'s and Abby\'s parents are also at the restaurant  and are talking when Russ receives a telegram that Jeff is taking the first plane out. Back at the other table Eddie asks Abby why her friend couldn\'t join them. Abby replies that she just wasn\'t interested. While she says this we see Gidget appear all dressed up to join them, much to the surprise of Abby, the boys, and Gidget\'s father. All the guys including Eddie are now completely drawn to her much to the anger of Abby. Finally they announce the time to dance where Eddie automatically grabs Gidget\'s hand, leaving an angry Abby and an overjoyed Judge to dance. Gidget and Eddie seem to hit it off. Later that night in Gidget\'s hotel room, Abby comes back in and explains to Gidget how she was annoyed that Gidget just came in like that and didn\'t even mention Abby inviting her. Gidget is unaware of how annoyed Abby is and replies that she was only doing her mom a favor. The next day we see Gidget surfing, and again a very annoyed Abby looks on because Abby hates the water and refuses to go in . Gidget also neglected to tell Abby that she surfs. The guys watch in amazement as Gidget shows off her surfing moves. They then join Gidget, and Eddie asks her for surfing lessons. On his first attempt he wipes out.

Jeff and Judge get in a boat and save her. While in the boat going back to join the others, Gidget flirts with Judge and agrees to go with him that night to watch Eddie perform, all in the presence of Jeff. The next day they are all on a boat and Gidget acts offended by a comment Abby makes about the water. So Gidget goes off to another part of the boat and Jeff follows her. He goes and tells her to cut it out, although Abby thinks Jeff now likes her. Abby decides to start a rumor about Gidget saying how she\'s slept with Eddie and other people, rationalizing that it is half true because Gidget had said that she gave herself "completely" to "that Moondoggie person". Abby tells her mom Mitzi who then goes and tells Gidget\'s mother Dorothy. Dorothy refuses to believe it and says that she thinks Abby started the rumor, and they get into an argument. Dorothy tells Russ and they both question Gidget; she denies even the thought of it. This leaves both her parents, especially her father, angry and frustrated. Dorothy and Russ get into a fight. Russ leaves and goes to the bar. Meanwhile Monty and Mitzi also get into a fight because Monty thinks Mitzi should have kept her mouth shut which results in Mitzi going down to the bar. While at the bar, Mitzi and Russ talk and realize they see eye to eye on things and have a drink. Meanwhile Monty and Dorothy talk in the hotel room and go downstairs to another bar in the hotel. After talking Russ and Mitzi decide to go to the Mauhana Room. Just as they leave, Dorothy and Monty also go to the Mauhana room, but by another route. This is all witnessed by the clerk at the desk. Meanwhile at the Luau, Abby is the center of attention, and is happy, primarily because Gidget isn\'t there. Eddie goes off to take a walk and bumps into Gidget who tells him of the rumor that is going around and says she doesn\'t want to go because she doesn\'t know if anyone else has heard. Eddie then pulls her aside and tells Gidget he\'s fallen in love with her. Gidget tells him that she doesn\'t like him, and that she\'s sorry. They agree to be friends. Gidget goes for a walk on the beach. While on the beach, Gidget pictures herself promiscuous and pregnant. Back at the Luau, Abby and Jeff are talking and Abby tells him about the rumor that Gidget sleeps around. Jeff can\'t believe it. Abby then admits it\'s a lie and she  only had one affair. Jeff asks when Gidget told her that, and Abby replies that Gidget told her on the plane, but why any girl would fall for a guy called "Moondoggie" is beyond her. Jeff then realizes how much he cares about Gidget. He tells Abby that he likes her and to call him what everyone at home calls him, "Moondoggie." Jeff runs off leaving an upset Abby at the Luau. On the beach Moondoggie and Gidget reconnect and talk about what happened on their way back to the hotel. Gidget asks the clerk if her parents were in and the clerk says Abby\'s Dad and Gidget\'s Mom went one way while Gidget\'s Dad and Abby\'s Mom went the other way. This leaves Gidget very worried and she decides to wait for them in their suite and Moondoggie accompanies her. We then see Monty, Mitzi, Russ, and Dorothy talking all together at a table. They discuss the situation, and Mitzi says she will punish Abby when they get back. Dorothy decides to call to see if Gidget is in her room, but gets no answer. When they get back to the hotel, they decide to wait for Gidget in her suite. Meanwhile Gidget is in her parents suite and is worried because she thinks her parents are cheating on each other. So she and Jeff make up a plan. In Gidget\'s suite, Dorothy calls all Gidget\'s friends asking if they saw her. The news then gets to Abby who feels horrible thinking that she caused all this. Eventually DeeDee, Abby, Abby\'s Parents, Eddie, Judge, Wally and Larry are all in Gidget\'s suite worrying about where she is. Finally Gidget\'s dad goes back to his suite to get something. Russ comes in to find Gidget and Moondoggie kissing on the couch. He cries out in relief, but Gidget tells him, that her Mom is asleep, but she fixed it so his bed looks slept in. But to get out of here and come back in the morning, so she won\'t suspect anything. Russ plays along and he and Jeff both go to Gidget\'s suite where Jeff sees that everyone is waiting. Russ tells Dorothy to go in and "get your half of what I got". She goes in and Gidget tells her the same thing but Dorothy goes into the bedroom and Gidget thinks her dad is not there and fears problems will arise. But to her surprise, her father is asleep in the bed. She taps him and he jumps up and yells "Boo!" Then everyone else comes in and is laughing at Gidget. Gidget laughs and kisses Jeff and tells Eddie sorry but he had no chance up against Jeff and explains to everyone what happened. All is well until Gidget realizes she has some unfinished business. The following day the gang drags Abby into the water. We see a wave come and a screaming Abby on Gidget\'s surfboard. Gidget just looks over to Jeff and laughs.'] ["A warm-hearted comedy about a compulsive soccer mom who masquerades as a famous Italian soccer star hired to coach her daughter's floundering soccer team, then struggles frantically to keep her wacky charade going long enough to see the girls win their big tournament"] ['Charley Brewster  is a huge fan of traditional Gothic horror films. He stays up late at night to watch the horror movie TV series "Fright Night" hosted by Charley\'s hero, Hammer Horror style actor Peter Vincent , who played a vampire killer for many years in horror movies. Charley discovers that his new next door neighbor, Jerry Dandridge  is a vampire. Upon coming to this terrible realization, Charley tries to tell his naturally skeptical yet loving mother, and asks his friends for their help. In desperation he calls the police but when he reveals his suspicions to them they believe he has a wild imagination and ignore his claims. That night Charley gets a visit from Jerry himself who offers Charley a "choice" : "Forget about me and I\'ll forget about you." Charley tries to use his crucifix on Jerry but the latter stops him and slowly tries to push Charley out the window to his death. Charley stabs Jerry through the hand with a pencil. Enraged, Jerry destroys Charley\'s car in retaliation and warns Charlie that he plans to do much worse to him later. Charley turns to Peter Vincent, for help, but Peter dismisses Charley as an obsessed fan. Charley\'s girlfriend, Amy Peterson , fears for Charley\'s sanity and safety so she hires the financially destitute Vincent to "prove" that Jerry is not a vampire by having him ingest what they claim is "holy water", but it turns out to only be tap water. Vincent accidentally discovers Jerry\'s true nature after glancing his lack of a reflection in his pocket mirror, which causes him to accidentally drop and smash the mirror. With this terrifying knowledge Peter flees but Jerry learns of Peter\'s discovery after finding a piece of his pocket mirror on the floor. Jerry hunts down and turns Charley\'s friend, Edward "Evil" Thompson , into a vampire. Evil then visits Peter and tries to attack him, only to be warded off when injured by a crucifix. Meanwhile, Jerry chases Charley and Amy into a club. While Charley is trying to call Peter for help, Jerry hypnotizes and abducts Amy, who bears a resemblance to Jerry\'s lost love . With nowhere left to turn, Charley attempts to gain Peter\'s help once more. Peter, frightened from having dealt with Evil, initially refuses, but then reluctantly resumes his "Vampire Killer" role as Charley approaches his neighbor\'s house. The two are able to repel Jerry\'s attack using a crucifix, though only Charley\'s works, since he has faith in its spiritual power. Billy Cole ([[Jonathan Stark , Jerry\'s live-in carpenter and daytime protector, appears and knocks Charley over the banister and to the ground. Peter flees to Charley\'s house, finding that Mrs. Brewster is at work, and is attacked by Evil Ed, who takes a wolf form. Peter apparently kills Evil after staking him through the heart. An unconscious Charley is taken to Amy who has been turned into a vampire by Jerry. Peter says the process can be reversed, but only if they kill Jerry before dawn. Charley and Peter are then confronted by Billy, whom Peter shoots, on the assumption that Billy is human due to having a reflection and appearing during daytime. This theory proves to be incorrect, as Billy rises again and is only killed when staked through the heart by Charley. Jerry appears, but Peter is able to lure the overconfident vampire in front of a window using a crucifix . Just before the morning sun lights him ablaze. Jerry turns into a bat and attacks Peter and Charley  before fleeing, wounded, to his coffin in the basement. Charley and Peter go in pursuit of Jerry; Peter breaks open Jerry\'s coffin and tries to stake him through the heart whilst Charley has to fight off Amy, who has completed her transformation. By breaking the blacked-out windows in the basement, Peter and Charley are able to expose Jerry to the sunlight and kill him. Jerry\'s death leads Amy to become human once more, and the three embrace. A few nights later Peter returns to his Fright Night TV series and announces a break from vampires, instead selecting to present an alien invasion movie, watched in Charley\'s bedroom by Charley and Amy. The last shot shows two red eyes appearing from the darkness of Jerry\'s house, followed by Evil laughing sarcastically "Oh, you\'re so cool, Brewster!", indicating that he had survived his fight with Vincent.'] ['The first character shown is Ruben. A college student, his job at Barako Café  is not nearly enough to pay his tuition. Having lost his scholarship on a technicality,Ruben resorts to burglary in order to cover his educational expenses. What ensues is a comedic overly choreographed fight-scene complete with wire work and overdone martial arts action. Shona leaves her son and her boyfriend  in order to return to work in Japan as an exotic dancer. Her predicament exemplifies the situation of every Filipino person who has come to the realization that life in the Philippines often does not allow the working person to earn money enough to save for a better living. Cher is a drag queen who, because of her sexuality, becomes the victim of violent homophobic aggression. His performance, while exaggeratedly comic, touches on the ugliness of homophobia and sexual discrimination. And yet the issue is never resolved, because Cher’s attackers are not punished for their hate crime. Neither is Shona condemned for abandoning her child in this instance of labor export from the Philippines, and the effects that it has on the people who must be left. Ruben’s moral and practical dilemma remains unresolved as well. The lives of three couples: Iza and Iñigo, Kulas and Joan, and Dino and Faith deal with objectification, unrequited love, and first sexual experiences, respectively.'] ['Dante Basco (Biker Boyz, [[Hook  plays Ben Mercado, a talented high school senior who enrolls in a prestigious arts institute in order to realize his dreams of becoming an artist.

At this point, a now 15 year old Jamie  has been impregnated. The baby is born on October 30, 1995 and is then carried away by the Man in Black who appears to be a leader of a Druidistic-like cult. Later that night, Mary , a nurse, helps Jamie escape with her baby she warns is in harms way. Michael , in pursuit of Jamie and her newborn, kills the nurse. Jamie and the baby flee in a stolen pickup of a drunk motorist  and hides at a dark and deserted bus station. She calls into a local radio station for help, only to be ignored by the DJ Barry Simms  who is doing a broadcast on the Haddonfield murders. Michael Myers nearly corners her, but she escapes only to later be run off the road by Michael. Beaten and exhausted, she makes her way inside of an old barn where Michael pushes her into a corn thresher, only to find that Jamie does not have the baby. Meanwhile, Tommy Doyle , the child Laurie Strode babysat in the first film, has his eye on a family who has moved into the old Myers house across the street from the boarding house where he lives. The boarding house is run by a mysterious old woman named Mrs. Blankenship . For years, Tommy has been obsessed with finding the truth behind the murderous motives of Michael Myers. After hearing Jamie begging for help on a local radio show, Tommy finds her baby at the bus station, takes the child into his care and names him Steven. Tommy runs into Dr. Loomis  at the Haddonfield Memorial Hospital and tells him of a family living in the old Myers house when the two are convinced Michael has indeed come back to Haddonfield. The people living in the Myers house are relatives of the Strode family who had adopted Laurie. While Kara Strode , her six-year-old son, Danny , and Kara\'s teenage brother, Tim , are at school, Dr. Loomis visits their mother Debra Strode  and reveals to her that she is living in Michael\'s home. After he leaves, Debra calls her husband John  who is at work and tries to convince him to leave Haddonfield but is then killed by Michael. Later, Kara returns home to find Danny in his room with Tommy, whom he had met while on his way home. The three of them go to Tommy\'s house across the street, where Tommy reveals to Kara that he believes Michael was selected by a cult of people to be under the influence of an ancient rune symbol called Thorn; that druid astronomers claimed originated from a constellation of stars that appear from time to time on Halloween night. It is an ancient Druid curse that represented a demon that spread sickness and caused destruction. To prevent this, a child from each tribe was chosen to inherit the curse and would offer a blood sacrifice of its next of kin on the night of Samhain . The curse explains why Michael is trying to kill his family and also accounts for his superhuman abilities. While Tommy goes out to look for Dr. Loomis at a party at the Haddonfield Junior College, Mrs. Blankenship reveals to Kara  that she was babysitting Michael Myers when he killed his sister many years ago, and that Danny hears the "voice" telling him to kill just like Michael Myers heard when she was babysitting him the night he killed Judith. This indicates that he is to be the next child to come into the influence of Thorn. Meanwhile, Michael kills Barry Simms then Tim and his girlfriend Beth . After Tommy returns to the boarding house with Dr. Loomis, the "Man in Black" finally reveals himself as Dr. Wynn , . After a terrifying showdown, he and his cult of people who appear to be the "Cult of Thorn" take Kara, Danny, Steven, and Michael back to Smith\'s Grove Sanitarium, with Tommy and Dr. Loomis drugged for the time being. When they awake, they follow the cult to Smith\'s Grove where Loomis confronts Dr. Wynn. Wynn credits him for recognizing the evil he corrupted inside Michael, and implies how Jamie\'s baby represents a new cycle of it. After inviting Loomis to join in on his conspiracy, Loomis calls Wynn out on his evil scheme before being knocked unconscious by a staff member. Meanwhile, Tommy finds Kara locked in a room in the maximum security ward. After a brief confrontation with Michael, they continue on to find Danny and Steven. In the hallway they see a team of surgeons, some dressed as cult members, standing near an operating room. Dr. Wynn joins them and tells them to take off their cult robes because "Halloween is over," suggesting that the doctors are posing as the Cult of Thorn to control Michael. Tommy and Kara soon sneak into the adjoining room where they find the children. They watch the doctors begin to perform the procedure, but Michael, seeing that the the doctors are not in their robes, soon interrupts it, walking in with a surgical machete and slaughtering them all, including Wynn. Tommy, Kara, and the kids run with Michael in hot pursuit until they hide in a high-tech medical laboratory. Inside the lab, Kara notices tanks containing human fetuses with a chart of runes and scientific letter codes; both connected together by the Thorn symbol. Dr. Wynn and his team seem to have been trying to discover the source of pure evil in Michael\'s DNA, possibly using women of the institution and Jamie for IVF experiments, resulting in Steven\'s birth. Michael breaks into the room where Tommy injects him with tranquilizers of a corrosive and beats him into unconsciousness with a lead pipe. As Dr. Loomis, Tommy, Kara, Danny, and Steven are about to escape, Loomis tells them to go on without him because he has "a little business" to attend to. Back inside the building, Michael\'s mask is found lying on the floor of the lab room as the screams of Dr. Loomis can be heard in the background.'] ['Andie Bradley  is a gymnast with big dreams for the Olympics.

When the children are asleep, Jill receives a telephone call from a man who asks her if she has checked the children. At first, Jill dismisses the telephone calls as a practical joke; however, as the calls become more frequent and threatening, Jill becomes frightened and telephones the police, who promise that they would trace the call if Jill would keep him on the telephone line long enough. Jill, frightened to extreme measures, arms herself as she receives one final telephone call from the nefarious caller. Soon after her conversation with him, Jill receives a call from the police, only to find out that the stalker is calling from inside the house. The suspense of this part of the movie climaxes when a light turns on at the top of the staircase, which allows Jill to see the shadow of the stalker. Jill immediately runs to the front door to scream for help. Officer John Clifford  is then shown at the police investigation. At this point, the viewer learns that the children had been murdered by the perp several hours earlier. Also, the murderer is identified; he is an English merchant seaman named Curt Duncan , and is subsequently sent to an asylum. Seven years later, Duncan escapes from the asylum, still psychopathic. Dr. Mandrakis hires ex-cop Clifford, now a private investigator, to find Duncan. Still not knowing Clifford is after him, Duncan is now a homeless, vagrant loner. He gets into a fight and is beaten after disturbing a middle-aged woman, Tracy , in a tavern, and later follows her to her apartment. Feeling sorry for his disastrous appearance and for the fact that his attempts at a conversation with her started the fight in the first place, Tracy makes light conversation with him. While they are in the doorway talking, Tracy\'s phone rings forcing her to excuse herself so she can go answer it. While she is on the phone, Duncan lets himself into her apartment. Tracy doesn\'t tell him to leave her place right away nor explicitly rebuffs his awkward proposal to visit her for coffee the next night, assuming or hoping it will be the last of him she will see. Meanwhile an increasingly obsessed and vindictive Clifford, having confided to a former partner  that his intention is to kill Duncan rather than arrest him, follows Duncan\'s trail right to the tavern where the fight took place, and from there to Tracy\'s residence—- precisely the same night in which Duncan is likely to arrive for his visit. Clifford goes there and tells her just how dangerous her situation has become. He also tells her that Duncan literally tore and hacked up Mandrakis\' children with his bare hands, rendering them virtually unrecognizable, which explains why he was found smeared with blood by the police; this, along with some eerie flashbacks experienced by Duncan later in the movie, is one of the few moments where the carnage at the Mandrakis household is described. Upon hearing this, Tracy reluctantly accepts to be Clifford\'s bait at the tavern that evening, although Duncan doesn\'t arrive and she finally decides to return home. Clifford then leaves Tracy\'s place; Duncan, who was hiding in Tracy\'s closet, pushes her to the wall and briefly muffles her cries for help. When he frees her, her horrified shrieks alert Clifford, force the intruder to flee the scene and mark the start of a cat-and-mouse chase through the streets of downtown Los Angeles, during which Clifford is outrun during at least two occasions and finally loses Duncan\'s track. Jill Johnson is now an adult, married with two young children. One night, Jill and her husband Stephen go out to dinner in celebration of a promotion. A friend named Sharon babysits her children. She references that she saw Jill in the newspaper. Curt Duncan happens to find the same newspaper in the city, and begins to look for Jill once again. While the couple is out, Jill gets a telephone call at the restaurant. She answers, and gets another "Have you checked the children...?" Jill panics and calls Sharon. She says nothing is wrong. The police arrive and escort Jill back home. John Clifford tries to telephone Jill, but gets no signal. Jill and Stephen sleep. Later, Jill goes down for a glass of milk, when the lights go out. She goes back upstairs and gets in bed once again. The closet door opens a little, and she hears the voice of Curt Duncan. She tries to awaken Stephen, who turns around, revealing that Curt is actually in the bed. He rips Jill\'s nightgown and chases her around the room. Clifford arrives, and kills Curt, shooting him twice. Stephen is revealed to be in the closet, alive but seemingly unconscious. As Clifford comforts Jill, the last view is of the house, in view of the frightening eyes of Curt Duncan.'] ["Superhuman serial killer Jason Voorhees has been dead and buried for years. However, Tommy Jarvis, who killed Jason in self defense when he was twelve years old, is still haunted by his encounter despite having been released from the mental institute after an extended period of time. Intent on cremating Jason's body to rid himself of his demons, Tommy, and his friend Hawes, breaks into the cemetery containing Jason's grave. He and Hawes exhume Jason's casket, but before they can cremate the body, an infuriated Tommy begins stabbing it with a steel fence post. Unfortunately, the fence post acts as a lightning rod for an incoming storm, and a bolt of lightning brings Jason back to life. Jason rips Hawes' heart out and throws his body into the exhumed coffin while Tommy escapes. Tommy returns to the town of Crystal Lake, the site of Jason's killings, which has now been renamed Forest Green to distance itself from negative publicity. Tommy attempts to warn the town sheriff, Mike Garris, of Jason's return, but Garris, aware of Tommy's institutionalization, writes him off as mentally disturbed, and has him locked in a holding cell. Meanwhile, Jason begins a trek back to the lake that which was the site of his drowning as a child. En route, he encounters Lizabeth and Darren, a pair of summer camp supervisors, who are themselves headed to the lake to supervise the reopening of the summer camp. Jason attacks and kills them, leaving their bodies in the woods. The next morning, Sheriff Garris's daughter, Megan, who is slated to be one of the camp counselors, arrives with fellow counselors Cort, Sissy, and Paula, to report Lizabeth and Darren missing. Tommy cites their disappearance as evidence of Jason's return, but is met with hostility from everyone but Megan, who takes a liking to him. Sheriff Garris sends the counselors off to the campsite and then escorts Tommy out of town, and en route, Tommy flees to the cemetery to try to show Garris the open grave, only to discover that the groundskeeper, fearful of being implicated for digging up the grave due to his alcoholism, has covered the grave, and, consequently, Hawes's body, with dirt. Garris handcuffs Tommy and takes him to the city limits, warning him not to return. Meanwhile, a quintet of business people playing paintball in the woods are set upon by Jason, who kills them and steals their supplies. That night, Jason continues making his way back to Crystal Lake, in the process killing the grave digger and a nearby couple having a picnic. Cort meets up with a local girl, Nikki, and leaves the camp to have sex with her in the woods, but they end up in Jason's path, and are both subsequently killed by him. Sheriff Garris's Deputy finds the bodies including the corporate executives that were playing paintball, and believes that Tommy has killed them, living out a delusion of Jason's return. Tommy, meanwhile, has contacted Megan, having figured out a way to defeat Jason after having read books on monsters and folklore. He can be incapacitated by being trapped beneath the surface of the lake where he drowned. Megan attempts to bring Tommy back to the camp, but they are intercepted by one of Garris's roadblocks, and Tommy is arrested, and Megan is escorted back to the police station to await her father's return from the field. The police's attention on Tommy permits Jason to slip into the summer camp, where he kills Paula and Sissy, but refrains from harming any of the children. Megan and Tommy escape the police station and make it to the lake, where the pursuing police are forced to acknowledge Jason's return when he attacks them. Garris and his deputies briefly incapacitate Jason by shooting him with high caliber weapons, but Jason ultimately recovers and kills them all including Sheriff Garris by bending him in two. He then attempts to kill Megan, but is distracted by Tommy, who beckons to him from the lake. Seemingly remembering Tommy, Jason abandons Megan and wades out to the lake, where Tommy ambushes him with a chain attached to a large boulder. A fight ensues, during which both Tommy and Jason are knocked into the water, and as Tommy attempts to swim to the surface, Jason pulls him underwater and apparently drowns him. Megan swims out to save Tommy and is likewise attacked by Jason, but finally incapacitates him by ramming a motor boat propeller into his neck and jaw eventually breaking his neck. Back on land, Megan revives Tommy with CPR and the children celebrate. At the bottom of the lake, Jason floats, attached to the boulder, still alive but powerless to escape."] ['One day in the fictional town Hillside in Southern California, the supplier of prescription medication to the students at the local high school, Troy Johnson , commits suicide.

The next day, Cindy Campbell , meets up with her boyfriend Bobby Prinze  and her friends, Brenda Meeks , Ray Wilkins , Greg Phillipe , and Buffy Gilmore . Various news teams - including hack reporter Gail Hailstorm  - converge on the school in the wake of Drew\'s brutal death. Gail hooks up with Buffy\'s mentally disabled brother Doofy ([[Dave Sheridan , hoping to milk the facts out of him. One day, while Cindy is in class, someone mysteriously leaves a note saying I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST HALLOWEEN. Cindy then realizes that Drew\'s murder occurred exactly one year after she and her friends accidentally killed a man during a wild car ride . Unwilling to face incarceration, the next day a series of increasingly bizarre events take place. Various members of the group receive threatening notes from Ghostface and are rapidly dispatched, but most remain steadfastly oblivious to the rising body count. The killer then attacks Cindy in her house. She tries to call the police but the killer escapes. Bobby arrives at her house but Ghostface  drops the knife and gloves which leads Cindy to thinking that Bobby is the killer the police arrest him . Greg is killed by Ghostface in plain view. Buffy tries to get help, but Buffy is at a beauty pageant and her talent was acting so they thought the cries were part of her act. Buffy, high on the success brought by the murder, becomes Ghostface\'s next victim. During the murder, Buffy thinks it\'s a game, so she does every cliche done by a white female in a horror film. Ghostface decapitates her . Later, Ghostface sticks his penis through Ray\'s head, seemingly killing him. Ghostface then attempts to dispose of Brenda during a showing of Shakespeare in Love, but the moviegoers, fed up with Brenda\'s constant loud interruptions during the movie, stab her repeatedly, seemingly killing her. Cindy throws a house party, hoping for safety in numbers. During the party, Bobby and Cindy go up stairs and have sex, no longer making Cindy a virgin. Ghostface unexpectedly appears and stabs Bobby, before disappearing quickly. Cindy gets a gun from a drawer near the entrance, Bobby follows and she tends to his wounds. Shorty , Brenda\'s stoner brother, comes up from the basement and informs them that the killer has murdered everybody in the house. Bobby takes the gun and shoots Shorty, revealing that his wound was an elaborate ruse. Ray then arrives on the scene - whereupon Bobby reveals to Cindy that he is now gay, and so is Ray - though Ray immediately denies it, despite his repeated homosexual advances and tendencies displayed throughout the movie. They announce their plan to kill her father and frame her sister. Bobby says he did it because Cindy never had sex with him and Bobby gleefully points out that even though their plan lacks sense it doesn\'t matter, since horror movies are not noted for their logic, they also say that are just copying the killer and are not the actual killers . Ray and Bobby also came up with a plan to make themselves look like heroes by giving each other stab wounds to indicate they fought her. But, Ray stabs Bobby repeatedly and nearly kills him revealing Ray\'s motive was because his favorite show The Wayans Bros.  had been cancelled. However, the real Ghostface abruptly turns up and stabs Ray, who collapses on top of Bobby in the Doggy style position. The killer then attacks Cindy, but she successfully subdues him by employing moves copied from The Matrix and kicks him through a window. Nonetheless, Ghostface vanishes before the police arrive. At the police station, Cindy and the local sheriff  realise that  Doofy - the only one who knew about the car accident - was actually faking his disability and is the true killer . Unfortunately, Doofy has already escaped with Gail Hailstorm. Upon finding his discarded disguise in the street, Cindy begins screaming "Noooooo" to the heavens - and gets run over by a car, presumably killing her  hence in reality the car crash only seriously injures  her. As the credits roll, Shorty - parodying the rules of a trilogy in Scream 3 - explains via videocassette that he may be in prison or deceased, but provides rules for surviving such a situation... which turn out to be instructions for surviving a snatch-and-run.'] ["Thirteen-year-old Ernest Chin's life is devoted to working at his family's hourly-rate motel, where a steady stream of prostitutes, johns, and various other shady characters come and go.

Tony declines, but his girlfriend Arlene  - as well as his widowed father  - show concern about his violent behavior. Later, at a Halloween party at “the Haunted House” – an old house that several of the teenagers hang out at – Tony attacks his friend Vic  after being surprised from behind. After seeing the shocked expressions on his friends’ faces, he realizes he needs help and goes to see Dr. Brandon. On Tony’s first visit, however, Brandon makes it clear that he has his own agenda while the teenager lies on the psychiatrist’s couch: Tony will be an excellent subject for his experiments with a scopolamine serum he’s developed that regresses personalities to their primitive instincts. Brandon believes that the only future mankind has is to 'hurl him back to his primitive state.' Although Brandon's assistant, Dr. Hugo Wagner , protests that the experiment might kill Tony, Brandon continues and within two sessions suggests to Tony that he was once a werewolf.

Brandon tells Tony he will help him and after telling him to lie on the couch, and injects him with the serum again.

The shooter himself is dead, shot by police during the confrontation after the actual shooting, and the only witness  is Alicia Browning , a gothic student who is now under the attention of the detective in charge of the case, Det. Martin Van Zandt . The school principal asks Alicia to visit Deanna in the hospital. Right away, their differences are evident. Alicia is an outsider from a single-parent family who shuns the society that similarly shuns her, while Deanna is from a wealthy family, gets good grades and is popular with her classmates. At first, Deanna seems upbeat and cheerful, but soon it becomes apparent that beneath this exterior are psychological scars left behind by the incident. Alicia starts to empathize with her, as she herself is battling her own demons as well, including a previous suicide attempt.

As the night progresses, they all try to find the biggest buzz they can, until Spencer suggests a ouija board, saying it is the weirdest buzz he\'s ever had. The partygoers agree and participate, all placing their right index fingers on an upside-down glass with the alphabet and the words \'Yes\' and \'No\' written in a circle around the glass. Lucy tells them that under no circumstances should they remove their fingers from the glass early – otherwise the spirit they summon will not be able to return.

Lucy suggests to the housemates that they may have summoned a djinn, saying the burns on Annie are signs of this being true. The housemates are still skeptical, so they watch the tape they recorded of the \'summoning\' to check if anyone was pushing it. Soon after Liam freaks out in the video, however, the electricity in the house goes out. Webster and Spencer break into the landlord\'s flat  and find a hidden shrine of sorts to the Djinn with grisly photos and newspaper cuttings. It is also revealed that Liam\'s father, Paul Brennan, had been in the same predicament once  and killed his mother as a result. He pled insanity and was put in a mental hospital. Joe attempts to get information out of Liam about it the next day at college, but he gets angry and leaves. Stella also leaves soon after, and goes to the toilet where she is brutally murdered . Her body is discovered by a nearby student. Liam goes to see his father to get answers but it quickly descends into a row. When Liam mentions Becker his father shouts that he is there to protect Liam. Liam leaves without hearing this. Meanwhile, Joe and Webster sneak back into the house  to get the camera which recorded the ritual and Webster insists on watching it there. Joe goes to the kitchen to get a light for his cigarette. Meanwhile Webster is thrown into a panic by something on the film. He goes to look for Joe. In the hallway he turns the lights on and realises he is standing in a pool of blood. He runs for the front door which is locked, so he rushes back upstairs to get the keys. He has to hide under the bed as he is being chased by the djinn. While the djinn does not see him, it dumps Joe\'s dead body in the room - his throat has been slit. Webster silently exits the room with keys in hand but steps on a broken light bulb, alerting the djinn. He races back down to open the door, but the djinn catches up and kills him before he can succeed. Rob and Spencer return to Lucy\'s boat and tell her of Stella\'s death. Lucy demands that they perform the banishing ritual, so they return to the warehouse where the party was held. Liam attempts to catch up with them, but upon arriving at their boat, they have already left. Lucy, Spencer and Rob begin the ritual, but as they are performing it, a sudden burst of flame from the ouija board frightens them all off. Spencer runs off and tries to look around, but when he drops a large metal pole he alerts the djinn, who has already arrived, to his location. He hides in a cupboard. We then learn that the djinn has possessed Rob. The djinn walks off, making Spencer think he is safe, until he bursts into the cupboard from behind and kills Spencer. Liam enters the building, as does Mr. Becker, who is holding a petrol can. As Liam walks into the ritual room, Rob runs out, shouting "Liam, it\'s Becker, he\'s here!" but is interrupted by Becker who hits him with a bat and proceeds to douse him with petrol. Liam, thinking Becker is the djinn, runs in to save Rob, accidentally pushing Becker down some stairs. When he goes back to look Becker has disappeared. Later Becker reappears and Liam is about to kill him in revenge for Annie until Rob rushes in and stops him. Seconds later, Rob kills Becker in a panic when Becker attempts to choke him. They start to leave, Rob attempting to convince Liam there really was no djinn but Liam remembers Lucy and they go looking for her. Liam finds her hanged in the lift shaft. Rob reveals to Liam that he is the djinn, telling Liam that it\'s his turn as his father sent him somewhere terrible, so now Liam will know the pain that he has. Liam attempts to stab him, but Rob blocks it with his hand, which bleeds but also starts a small flame. As Rob taunts Liam, Liam realises through another flashback that fire will kill the djinn. He grabs the nearby lantern and wards off Rob with it, but as Rob attempts to fake being unpossessed  Liam tosses the lantern at him, setting him ablaze. Liam kicks him down the lift shaft, but a few seconds later he grabs onto Liam\'s shin . Liam finishes him by shutting the lift door on him, causing him to fall all the way down. After a while Liam opens the door to check he is dead, but a burst of flame pushes him back, signalling his body has been destroyed. Liam goes back to the mental hospital to see his father face to face, and they reconcile only for Liam to reveal he too is now possessed. He kills his father. The djinn, now free, sets off. As the camera rolls back from the cell, it is revealed that Liam had killed a prison officer to get in, and Liam suddenly appears in front of the camera, and reveals his eyes are now permanently like the djinn\'s.'] ['The film is about Melanie Porter , a 17-year-old college-bound girl who is getting ready to graduate from high school and really wants to go to Georgetown University.

Crowther, Posner, Dakin, Timms, Akthar, Lockwood, Scripps, and Rudge have recently obtained the school\'s highest ever A-level scores and are hoping to enter Oxford or Cambridge, taking a seventh-term entrance exam in History. The General Studies teacher, known by staff and boys alike by his nickname "Hector" , is their favourite, and works alongside their deputy head and regular History teacher, Mrs. Lintott . The headmaster, Felix , hires an energetic young contract teacher named Irwin  to assist Hector and Mrs Lintott in preparing the boys for the Oxbridge entrance exams. Irwin\'s style is utterly different from Hector\'s and Mrs. Lintott\'s; while the older teachers emphasise cultural and factual knowledges and the quest for truth, Irwin urges the boys to put a spin on their historical analysis, to value originality above objective truth. As the plot progresses we learn that Hector habitually offers some of his students rides home on his motorcycle and surreptitiously fondles his passengers. The boys have all come to a mutual understanding on the subject and, while mildly annoyed, laugh off their teacher\'s advances and more or less willingly continue to take turns riding home on the back of his bike. This practice eventually lands Hector in trouble as he is reported to the headmaster by a lollipop lady who witnesses his action. The headmaster insists that Hector retire early, and also that Hector and Irwin share a class; when they do, the group engages in a tense discussions such as about how best to analyse the Holocaust. As part of their General Studies the class acts out scenes from romantic films and literature, and Posner ([[Samuel Barnett  sings a love song – Rodgers and Hart\'s "Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered" – which he pointedly directs towards Dakin . Later he seeks out Irwin to discuss his attraction to Dakin. Dakin, who characterises himself as an aspiring lecher, is currently pursuing an affair with the headmaster\'s secretary, Fiona . He is not displeased by Posner\'s attention, but finds himself interested by Irwin. Gradually, Dakin\'s quest to impress Irwin on an intellectual level evolves into a flirtatious, potentially sexual pursuit of his young teacher – who, as Posner, his friend Scripps  and even Hector note, is visibly attracted to Dakin. After interviews, when the boys receive their replies through the post, it seems that they have all gained Oxbridge places, except for the group\'s gauche sportsman, Rudge . When Mrs Lintott questions him, it turns out that Rudge had already been told at interview that he has a place, due to a family connection with the college . Dakin approaches Irwin in his classroom after the celebrations and reveals that he found no record of Irwin\'s attendance at Corpus, the Oxford college he claimed as his alma mater, and Irwin confesses that he lied about his past. Dakin then, "as a thank you", invites Irwin to give him a blowjob. They make an appointment to "have a drink" on Sunday. Dakin tells Irwin that he has seen two sides to Irwin—a reckless, challenging intellectual whilst teaching but an uptight, cautious personality in real life—and he cannot reconcile them. Dakin then proceeds to the Headmaster\'s office and, by threatening to reveal Felix\'s own sexual harassment of Fiona, forces him to reinstate Hector. The boys prepare to leave the grammar school at the end of that term, and Hector agrees to give Dakin a ride home on the motorbike "for old times\' sake". However, before they leave, the headmaster runs out and stops them, saying that Hector should not take one of the boys. He suggests that Hector take Irwin instead. Dakin gladly hands the helmet to him, and the screen fades to white as they drive off, the boys waving happily and laughing. Fast forward to a few days later, as it is revealed that the bike was in an accident on the way home, possibly caused by Irwin, never before having ridden on the back of a motorbike, leaning the wrong way on a corner. Irwin was badly injured and suffered total memory loss of his conversation with Dakin; Hector did not survive. At the memorial service, the boys sing "Bye Bye Blackbird" and the headmaster gives a trite eulogy. The scene then changes abruptly to an almost empty hall with only the eight boys and Mrs. Lintott present. "Will they come to my funeral, I wonder," Mrs Lintott remarks, before recounting the futures of the eight boys. They have entered a variety of careers: Akthar a headmaster, Crowther a magistrate, Timms the owner of a dry cleaning chain who takes drugs at weekends, Dakin a tax lawyer. Lockwood , who entered the army, died as a result of friendly fire at the age of 28 while serving in the York and Lancaster Regiment . Rudge has become a builder, Scripps a journalist, and Irwin stops teaching and becomes a maker of TV history documentaries. Finally, Posner reveals he has become a teacher who followed in Hector\'s footsteps, with similar ambivalence and angst, though without "touching the boys", which is "always a struggle. But maybe that\'s why I\'m a good teacher". The film ends with a collection of moments involving Hector, leading up to the moment that a photograph of the entire class was taken at Fountains Abbey, a scene from earlier in the film. The photo spans the entire screen, and the closing credits are played over the photo.'] ['Kim Possible  is a high-school cheerleader and world-famous crimefighter, and Ron Stoppable  is her faithful sidekick. Ron has a pet naked mole rat named Rufus . The film begins at the start of a new school year, but the start of a fun year is ruined when Ron finds out he\'s moving to Norway. Meanwhile, Dr. Drakken, Shego, Duff Killigan, and Monkey Fist team up to steal the Time Monkey, a small statuette used to travel through time. With help from her computer guru Wade Load  and her friend Monique, Kim follows the villains to Australia as they steal the body and head of the Time Monkey, but the villains connect the head to the body inside the Time Monkey\'s temple in Africa, and they escape through the resulting time portal. Shortly afterward, Kim is visited by a large talking mole rat from the future, a descendent of Rufus named Rufus 3000, who gives Kim a time-travel device and explains that "The Supreme One" is preparing to take over the world. Meanwhile, Drakken, Killigan, and Monkey Fist turn themselves into little children and travel back in time to Kim\'s first day in preschool in order to discourage her from becoming a crimefighter. Posing as her schoolmates, the villains try to bully the four-year-old Kim, but she defeats them and makes friends with Ron, and the high-school-age Kim arrives to fight Shego, who has been observing her accomplices. With their preschool plot foiled, the villains turn back into adults and escape forward in time, to a day when Kim and Ron are middle-school teenagers. When a billionaire traps himself in the web of deadly laser beams that guard his vault, his security expert accidentally contacts Kim through her new babysitting website, so, after a neighbor drives Kim and Ron to the billionaire\'s mansion, Kim uses her cheerleading gymnastic skills to jump through the laser beams and save the billionaire. Monkey Fist goes into the past and retrieves a huge rock gorilla, which attacks Kim, but high-school-age Kim and Ron appear, and high-school Ron destroys the rock gorilla by accidentally activating the security lasers. As police officers arrest Drakken, Killigan, and Monkey Fist, Shego, after being visited by her future self while watching the fight, escapes with the Time Monkey into the future. Rufus 3000 then arrives and reveals to Kim that Shego is the Supreme One, not Drakken stating that he thought it was obvious to her since Shego is the only one smart enough to actually take over the world. Kim then activates the time portal and her, Ron, Rufus, and Rufus 3000 go to the future to stop her.  In the future, Shego has become dictator of the world and made everyone her slaves. Kim and Ron are captured and sent to their old high school to be brainwashed, but they are rescued by Kim\'s twin brothers Tim and Jim, along with Rufus 3000 and an army of naked mole rats. The twins take Kim and Ron to the secret headquarters of the political resistance movement, whose leader is Wade. Together, they and all of the Rufuses sneak into Shego\'s castle, where they fight their way past the villains and an army of monkeys to the room where Shego keeps the Time Monkey. After capturing Kim and her friends, Shego reveals that she separated Kim and Ron by making money in the 1990s stock-market boom, buying the company that Ron\'s mother worked for, and having her transferred to Norway, her reason being that while together, Kim and Ron actually made a decent team, but if they were apart, they couldn\'t stop her. In his anger at having to live in Norway and the destruction of his favorite nacho restaurant, Ron throws Drakken across the room. The twins break out of their chains, the pillars that hold up the palace ceiling collapse, and the Time Monkey falls to the floor and breaks, undoing all the effects of Shego\'s time travel. This causes Kim, Ron, and Rufus to float through a time portal and travel back to the first scene of the film, at the end of their first school day. At the moment when the first time disturbance occurred, a wave of time distortion washes over Kim and Ron, and when the moment has passed, the world has been restored to its original state and the two teens have lost all memory of the film\'s events, except that Ron knows he hates meat cakes, which he was forced to eat in Norway.'] ['The story begins on October 31, 1963, in fictional Haddonfield, Illinois, with Michael Myers  looking through a window, at his older teenage sister, Judith Myers , and her boyfriend kissing in the living room. The boyfriend pulls away from Judith, and asks if they are alone. Judith quickly glances around, musing that Michael is no doubt around the house. The two teenagers then decide to go upstairs. When Michael sees the light go off in Judith\'s bedroom window, he enters the kitchen and takes a butcher knife out of a drawer. After Judith\'s boyfriend goes home, Michael enters Judith\'s room and stabs her repeatedly until she falls down dead. He then walks downstairs and out the front door with the knife in his hand. Once outside, a car pulls up, and the occupants are soon revealed to be his parents. His father pulls off the mask to reveal a six-year-old boy, and the camera slowly pans out as both parents stare at him in horror. Following the murder, Michael is sent to Smith\'s Grove Sanitarium, where he is placed under the care of psychiatrist Dr. Samuel Loomis . Michael enters a state of catatonia and remains that way for the next fifteen years. Loomis, accompanied by nurse Marion Chambers  arrives at the sanitarium on October 30, 1978 to bring Michael to a court hearing, but he escapes, stealing the car that Chambers was driving, attacking her in the process and makes his way back to Haddonfield, killing a tow truck driver for his clothes. Loomis follows him there, attempting to prevent Michael from murdering anyone else. The following day--Halloween--high school student Laurie Strode  continually sees Michael, now wearing dark blue coveralls and a white mask, first at her school, then on the street. Laurie\'s friends, Annie Brackett  and Lynda van der Klok , dismiss Laurie\'s concerns. Then, later at her house, she sees Michael outside, in the yard, staring into her room. Laurie is startled, but then dismisses it thinking it was a neighbor. Meanwhile, Dr. Loomis goes to the local cemetery, and is guided by the groundskeeper to the grave plot of Judith Myers. The groundskeeper becomes angry when he discovers a missing headstone, and looks down at his papers. He then looks up at Dr. Loomis, and tells him that the missing headstone belonged to Judith Myers. Upon hearing this news, Dr. Loomis mutters under his breath, "He came home." Later on, Annie\'s father, Sheriff Leigh Brackett , is approached by Loomis, and the two quietly look for Michael. That night, Laurie babysits a boy named Tommy Doyle , while Annie babysits a girl named Lindsey Wallace  across the street from the Doyle house. Michael methodically stalks Annie and kills Lindsey\'s dog. When Annie gets a call from her boyfriend, Paul, to pick him up, she takes Lindsey to the Doyle house. Annie gets in her car to pick up Paul but she is killed by Michael, who strangles and slits her throat with a knife. Meanwhile at the Doyle House, Tommy spots Michael carrying Annie\'s body back into the house. He thinks Michael is the bogeyman and tries to tell Laurie, who dismisses his claims. Later, Lynda and her boyfriend, Bob, enter the house unaware that Michael is inside. They then retire into the bedroom, where they have sex. Afterwards, Michael impales Bob onto the wall with a kitchen knife, then strangles Lynda with a telephone cord as she talks on the phone with Laurie. The disturbing disruption to the phone call concerns Laurie even further. Feeling unsettled, Laurie enters the Wallace house after the murders. She sees the dead bodies of her friends that Michael has killed and hidden. Michael has placed his sister Judith\'s headstone behind Annie\'s body. Suddenly, Laurie is attacked by Michael and falls backwards down the staircase. She runs out of the house, and tries to get someone to help her, only to be ignored. Eventually, she flees back to the Doyle house, but the door is locked, so she has to tell Tommy to open the door quickly as Michael slowly walks toward the house. Luckily, Tommy opens the door in time and lets Laurie inside. Laurie then instructs the children to hide and then realizes that the phone is dead, and that Michael has gotten into the house through a window. As she sits down in horror next to the couch, her hand falls on a knitting needle. Michael appears and tries to stab her, but she counterattacks his move, and stabs him in the neck with the knitting needle, and he collapses by the window. Laurie makes her way to an upstairs bedroom and locks herself in a closet, but Michael breaks a hole in the door. Laurie attacks by poking Michael in the eye with a clothes hanger, and then stabs Michael in the chest with his own knife. Michael collapses and Laurie exits the closet. Meanwhile, outside, Dr. Loomis sees Tommy and Lindsey running away from the house and suspects that Michael could be in the house. Michael gets up and tries to strangle Laurie, but she is saved by Dr. Loomis, who shoots Michael six times in the chest. Michael falls from the second-story window, onto the lawn below. When Dr. Loomis looks over the balcony, however, Michael\'s body is missing. Laurie begins to cry as Loomis looks out suspiciously into the night. Michael\'s masked breathing is heard as previous locations of the movie are shown.'] ['A group of friends play the Japanese game Kokkuri to summon Kokkuri-san, a spirit who can answer any question as a pastime but apparently reveals dark secrets that will make these girls turn against each other.

The film starts with a ten-year old girl named Sam Montgomery  living in the San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles, with her widowed father Hal , who runs a popular sports-themed diner. Hal soon marries a vain, self-absorbed woman named Fiona . Hal is killed when, during an earthquake, he runs to save Fiona. Supposedly leaving no will, Fiona receives all of his belongings, including the house and diner, and to her dismay, Sam. Eight years later, eighteen-year old tomboy Sam is employed as a worker at the diner to save money for Princeton, where she is tormented by Fiona and her two dim-witted daughters, Brianna  and Gabriella . Fiona emotionally abuses Sam and uses unnecessary amounts of water during a drought. A running gag throughout the film demonstrates Sam\'s stepsisters participating in synchronized swimming, for which they are found to have absolutely no talent. Sam struggles to cope socially at North Valley High School, where Queen Bee cheerleader, Shelby Cummings , also torments her and calls her "Diner Girl." Sam confides in her online pen pal "Nomad" about her dream to attend Princeton University, a dream which he also shares. However, "Nomad"\'s true identity is Austin Ames , the popular, yet unhappy, quarterback of the school\'s football team, and Shelby\'s boyfriend . "Nomad" proposes that they meet in person at the school\'s Halloween dance. Initially reluctant, Sam is convinced by her friend Carter Ferrell , to go to the dance and meet her mysterious online friend. On the night of the dance, Fiona orders Sam to work the night shift at the diner, then leaves to drive Brianna and Gabriella to the dance. Carter and Rhonda , Sam\'s best friends convince her to disobey Fiona and go to the dance any way. Carter and Rhonda take Sam to find a costume for the dance. Sam, wearing a mask and a beautiful white dress, meets "Nomad" at the dance, and is surprised and shocked to learn that he is Austin. The two decide to leave the party to walk alone and get to know each other. After sharing a romantic dance together, Sam and Austin begin to fall in love. But just as Austin is about to unmask her, Sam\'s cell phone alarm goes off, warning her to return to the diner before Fiona comes back at midnight. She leaves without revealing her identity to Austin, and drops her phone on her way out. Austin picks up her cell and begins a desperate search to figure out who his "Cinderella" really is, the result being that every girl in school claims to be the mysterious owner of the phone. Sam is reluctant to reveal her identity to Austin, feeling that he won\'t accept her due to her not-so-elegant lifestyle. Carter, dressed as Zorro, rescues Shelby from the unwanted amorous advances of Austin\'s friend, David . Shelby falls for "Zorro" not knowing who he is and Carter resolves to tell her who he really is the next day, only to end up being shunned when he does. When Austin comes into the diner one day, Sam is forced to help him and, after a talk, she attempts to reveal her identity to him, but is cut off by Fiona. Sam\'s stepsisters convince Shelby that Sam tried to steal Austin from her, and, during a prep rally, Sam\'s identity is revealed to Austin. Like Austin, Sam had been accepted to Princeton, only to be duped by Fiona believing she was rejected. Sam then decides to give up her dreams and resigns herself to working at the Diner. Rhonda gives Sam a pep talk. When her stepsisters come in, they cause a guitar to fall off the wall, taking the wallpaper it is attached to with it. Sam then sees her father\'s words "NEVER LET THE FEAR OF STRIKING OUT KEEP YOU FROM PLAYING THE GAME", and regains her confidence. A fed up Sam then confronts Fiona about the mistreatment she\'s given her, she quits her job at the diner and moves out to live with Rhonda. Simultaneously, Rhonda and the rest of the diner\'s staff quit along with Sam, having put up with Fiona\'s abuse for Sam\'s sake all those years after Hal died.

The camp collects each child individually, then delivers them to the boot camp facility on a remote island in Fiji. There are no walls to stop the teenagers from leaving, but escape is impractical due to the surrounding sea. On arriving at the camp, the teenagers are forced to wear cuffs with sensors around their ankles &mdash; if they attempt to escape, security will be alerted. Dr. Hail, who runs the camp, forces the teens to work constantly. He has them clean the camp, grow plants, and has them rebuild the camp after it was damaged in a storm. Campers are required to wear color coded t-shirts. First, new arrivals are given black t-shirts. They progress to yellow and then white. The teens earn a white shirt once they have been "corrected". They do not do work; they become staff members and abuse the other inmates and monitor their work. Among the staff is Logan, an ex-soldier. He is very tough towards the inmates and makes deals with girls in exchange for sex. The main teenagers featured are Sophie, her boyfriend Ben, Danny and Trina. As time passes on the island, Sophie rebels against Dr. Hail, and once Ben joins her, the two escape to a nearby island. However, they are recaptured, and Ben is told he will be sent home. One morning, while on a run, Logan, has the male teenagers go swimming. However, Danny, who can\'t swim, drowns, and Logan tries to get Ben to help cover it up by threatening him with solitary confinement, but Ben refuses. Meanwhile, Sophie discovers that Logan has raped Trina, and when Logan is put before the camp to admit responsibility for Danny\'s death, she reveals this to the rest of the teenagers, many of whom also were offered yellow shirts by Logan in exchange for sex. As the teenagers surround Logan, Sophie turns the attention onto Hail, at which point Ben announces to the shocked teenagers that this isn\'t the first death to occur on a camp run by Dr. Hail. The teenagers run amok, burning down the entire campsite, and then go after Logan, who dies when his jeep crashes into a burning building.

The luckiest of the Yelnats ancestors, Stanley Yelnats I, lost his fortune when the outlaw Katherine Barlow  stole his money chest. The Yelnats blame their ancestor, Elya Yelnats, who was cursed after breaking a promise to fortune teller Madame Zeroni who asked him to carry her up a mountain to a fortifying river. One day, Stanley is falsely arrested and convicted for stealing a pair of sneakers that Clyde "Sweetfeet" Livingston, a famous baseball player, had donated to charity. Stanley chooses to attend Camp Green Lake, a juvenile detention camp, instead of being imprisoned for his crime. He arrives to find that the "camp" is a dried-up lake run by Warden Walker, her assistant Mr. Sir, and camp counselor Dr. Pendanski. Each day, the detainees must dig a five-foot round hole in the desert to "build character", despite the dangers of scorpions, rattlesnakes, and yellow-spotted lizards, which can kill with a single bite. The inmates are known by their nicknames, and include Zero, Armpit, Zigzag, Squid, X-Ray, and Magnet. Stanley is slowly accepted into the group, especially after allowing X-Ray to take credit for his discovery of a gold tube , with the initials "KB" , and is given the nickname of "Caveman". He soon befriends Hector "Zero" Zeroni and teaches him to read. In a parallel flashback story, it is revealed that the location of Camp Green Lake was once a thriving town a century earlier, and the lake was once the largest lake in Texas. Miss Katherine Barlow , a local school teacher, rejects rich landowner Trout Walker  in favor of local onion seller Sam , a black man. When Sam kisses Katherine, the townspeople burn the school because he is black and she is white. Sam attempts to escape on his boat, but Trout shoots Sam. In retaliation, Katherine shoots the local sheriff for not stopping Trout from shooting Sam, and kisses his face, thereby beginning her career as an outlaw named "Kissin\' Kate" who infamously kisses every person she kills. Sam\'s death also causes a curse to fall upon the town area, drying the lake and causing rains to stop, leading to the town desertification and the ruin of the Walker family. After Pendanski insults Hector, Hector retaliates by hitting Pendanski in the face with his shovel and runs away. Feeling that no one knows or cares about Zero, the Warden orders that his file be erased from the computer. Stanley sets out to find Hector  and eventually finds him taking shelter under the remains of Sam\'s boat, the \'Mary Lou\' . Out of desperation, Stanley and Hector spot a rock formation called "God\'s Thumb" in the distance, and walk towards it, remembering that Stanley Yelnats I had survived the desert by seeking refuge on the mountain after Kate Barlow robbed him. Meanwhile, the Warden decides to presume Hector dead by deleting his files. Hector faints from lack of water leaving Stanley having to carry him up the mountain where they find Sam\'s field of onions and water, helping them regain strength for several days. Unknowingly, Stanley breaks the family curse because Hector is a descendant of Madame Zeroni. When he carries Hector to the top of the mountain, he sings to him and lets him drink from the stream that runs uphill, fulfilling the promise made by Elya Yelnats centuries earlier. Moments later, after Hector has woken up, he reveals he is the reason why Stanley was sent to Camp Green Lake. He reveals that since he is homeless, he had been at the homeless shelter and walked off with the donated shoes, not knowing they were famous. After being pursued by the police, he took off the shoes and tossed them over the bridge where they fall on Stanley\'s head and implicate him. Zero then explains that he was arrested the next day after stealing shoes from a Payless store. Stanley then believes the fact that they met is destiny. In another flashback, an older Kate Barlow is found in the middle of the now dried-up lake at the remains of Sam\'s boat by Trout Walker, now poor, and his wife, Linda, a former student of Kate\'s. They order Kate at gunpoint to hand over the Yelnats treasure, but she tells them that "you, your children, and your children\'s children will dig for a hundred years, and you will never find it." Kate commits suicide by allowing a yellow-spotted lizard to bite her on her wrist and dies while laughing. It was then an angered Trout and his descendants start to dig up the lake for years, and his granddaughter  came up to authorize the camp for troubled boys to speed up the process. Stanley and Zero finally decide to go back to Camp Green Lake to investigate the hole where Stanley had found Kate Barlow\'s tube of lipstick and uncover a rusty old chest. The Warden, Mr. Sir and Pendanski discover them and attempt to take the chest away from Stanley and Zero until they notice yellow-spotted lizards climbing all over the boys. However, the lizards don\'t attack the boys, due to the consumption of the onions, which the lizards hate. This bought enough time for the Attorney General and Stanley\'s lawyer Carla Morengo arrive to secure Stanley\'s release. When Ms. Morengo berates the Warden for the delaying, the Warden asserts that the boys stole the chest from her office. Angered, Stanley comes out of the hole, with the lizards leaving him, and calls the Warden a liar. Zero rebuts the lie with the fact that Stanley\'s name, "Stanley Yelnats", is written on the chest. With the fact confirmed, Ms. Morengo allows Stanley to take the chest home with him; he also convinces her to check out Zero\'s file to secure Zero\'s release. However, the Warden is forced to confess that she has lost Zero\'s file, prompting the angered Attorney General to order an investigation on Camp Green Lake. After doing so, the Attorney General then orders his deputies to arrest the Warden, Mr. Sir , and Pendanski on the charges of misprison of felony and perverting the course of justice, much to the other boys\' delight. This allows Zero to finally come along with Stanley and Ms. Morengo back to Stanley\'s house. Also, the fact that Stanley carried Zero up the mountain and sung the lullaby to him causes the curse put upon Stanley\'s family by Madame Zeroni to be lifted, and then it rains after over 100 years of drought. The Yelnats family claims rightful ownership of the chest and gives half of the money to Hector. The Yelnats move to a new house and live in financial comfort while Hector uses his share to hire private investigators to find his missing mother and they become Stanley\'s next-door neighbors. Camp Green Lake is then converted into a girls scout camp, with Stanley assuring that the girls and the counseloers won\'t have to worry about the yellow-spotted lizards as long as they consume lots of good onions that can repel the lizards. The film ends with Stanley, Zero, their family and friends, along with Clyde Livingston and his wife, watching a commercial promoting a new odor eliminator made by Stanley\'s father with the usage of peaches and onions.'] ['Lauren King  is a highly intelligent 13-year-old American girl living in Paris with her affluent family.

He had lost a previous coaching position after striking a student, so he is under pressure to succeed. Like much of the state, Hickory's community is passionate about basketball. People are aware that the best player in town, Jimmy Chitwood, does not intend to play on this season's team. Faculty member Myra Fleener warns the new coach not to try to persuade Jimmy to change his mind; she believes he needs to focus on school work in order to get a scholarship to attend college and have a better future. The school enrollment is so small that Dale has only a few players on his squad. Built on a four pass offense, Dale remains steadfast when a player disobeys him in an early season game, keeping him on the bench and playing with four players after another fouls out. The coach alienates the community with a slow, defensive style that does not immediately produce results and by losing his temper, which causes him to be ejected from more than one game. Dale needs a new assistant coach and invites knowledgeable basketball fan Shooter, the alcoholic father of one of his players, to join him on the bench. This, too, confounds the town, including Shooter's son. By the middle of the season, an emergency town meeting is called to vote on whether Dale should be dismissed. Fleener appreciates the coach's staying away from Chitwood and sides with him, but the town votes him out. At the last minute, Chitwood asks permission to speak: he says he's ready to begin playing basketball again, but only if Dale remains as coach. From this point, Hickory becomes an unstoppable team. Despite a setback in which Shooter arrives drunk to a game and ends up in a hospital, the team advances through tournament play, with contributions from unsung players, such as the pint-sized Ollie and devoutly religious Strap. Hickory shocks the state by reaching the state championship game. In a large arena and before a crowd bigger than any they've seen, the Hickory players face long odds to defeat a team from South Bend, whose players are taller and more athletic. But with Chitwood scoring at the last second, tiny Hickory takes home the 1952 Indiana state championship."] [" Kris Fowles  goes to the Springwood Diner to meet with her boyfriend, Dean Russell , who falls asleep at the table and meets a man covered in burn scars, wearing a red and green sweater, a fedora and a clawed glove on his hand.

She and her two best friends, Hilary Faye  and Veronica , have formed a girl group called the Christian Jewels. Everything seems perfect—until Mary’s "perfect Christian boyfriend" Dean Withers  tells her, as they’re swimming underwater, that he thinks he\'s gay. In her shock, Mary hits her head in the pool and has a vision in which Jesus tells her that she must do everything she can to help Dean. Hoping for a sign, Mary goes to a shooting range with Hilary Faye, who has a "spiritual solution for everything" and tells Mary  that if all else fails, Jesus could still restore their "spiritual and emotional virginity." Believing that Jesus will restore her purity, Mary sacrifices her virginity to have sex with Dean in an attempt to restore his heterosexuality. Despite Mary\'s efforts, when she comes by Dean\'s house on the morning of the first day of school, Dean\'s parents tell her that they found gay pornography under his bed and that they\'re sending him to Mercy House, a Christian treatment center. Mary tells her friends, as well as Hilary\'s brother Roland , who uses a wheelchair, about Dean\'s homosexuality, and makes them promise to keep it a secret. When they arrive at school, they see Cassandra Edelstein , the school\'s only Jewish student and a rebel who despises Hilary. In homeroom, Mary meets new student Patrick , the son of the school\'s principal, Pastor Skip Wheeler , a skateboarder who has been doing missionary work  in South America. Mary tries to put up a good front at the assembly, in which Cassandra fakes speaking in tongues in order to get under the skins of the other students. Mary soon realizes that she is pregnant from her encounter with Dean. When she goes to Planned Parenthood to confirm the pregnancy, she is seen by Roland and Cassandra. Roland reveals that he isn\'t really a Christian, unlike his fanatically religious sister. Cassandra reveals she\'s only at American Eagle after being thrown out of her old school. Roland and Cassandra bond over their shared skepticism. Mary finds out that she\'s not due to give birth until after her high school graduation and decides to hide her condition from her friends and family until then. However, she feels forsaken by Jesus and loses her faith, causing her to be ostracized by Hilary and replaced in the Christian Jewels with a previously unpopular girl, Tia , who\'s been struggling to get into the Christian Jewels for years. Later, after Pastor Skip gets word about Mary, he tells the Jewels to help Mary regain her faith, but they seem to misunderstand him and stop Mary in the street and try to exorcise her of demons instead. By Christmas, Mary is still hiding her pregnancy. Cassandra mocks her about it when they are alone in the bathroom, but when she realizes Mary\'s anguish, Cassandra changes her tone and offers her support. They cut school with Roland, and the three of them become good friends. When they run into Patrick and Hilary at the mall, Cassandra distracts Hilary  while Patrick and Mary sneak away and Patrick confesses his feelings for Mary. Pastor Skip warns his son when they\'re at home together against dating Mary, even as Pastor Skip  has been secretly dating Mary\'s mother, Lillian . A few months later, after multiple fights at school between Hilary Faye and Cassandra, Pastor Skip puts Roland, Cassandra and Mary on the school prom committee  to punish them. While working together, Patrick asks Mary to go with him to the prom as "friends," which Mary accepts. Later that day, Roland and Cassandra get their hands on a picture of a younger, much heavier, and much more awkward Hilary Faye and load it onto the desktop of every computer in the school. The next day, someone vandalizes the school with graffiti. Mary and Cassandra are initially the prime suspects, and to their shock the spray cans are found in their lockers. While searching the lockers with the Jewels looking on, Mary\'s homeroom teacher finds a sonogram of Mary\'s baby. She tries to hide it, but it drops to the ground in front of Pastor Skip\'s feet. Cassandra is expelled from school, while Mary is banned from the prom. Pastor Skip tells Lillian that he will break off their relationship if she doesn\'t send Mary to Mercy House. Lillian decides that she\'s going to send Mary away, saying that it\'s the best thing for Mary and the baby, but secretly because she doesn\'t want Skip to break up with her. Despite being banned, Cassandra and Roland scheme to go to prom and to bring Mary with them, providing her with a dress and inviting Patrick to meet them. Roland also finds that Hilary Faye charged several cans of spray paint to her credit card just hours before the attack—apparently indicating that she was the one who spray-painted the school. Hilary Faye, Tia and Veronica head to the prom. On their way in, Tia finds a credit-card receipt for the spray paint—signed by Hilary Faye. When Mary, Patrick, Cassandra and Roland arrive, Hilary attempts to have Mary and Cassandra thrown out, but Pastor Skip decides to let them stay. The four then accuse Hilary Faye of committing the vandalism herself and framing Mary and Cassandra for it as revenge for humiliating her. Hilary Faye reluctantly swears before God that she is innocent. Fed up with Hilary Faye\'s hypocrisy, Tia reveals the signed receipt. Veronica turns on her as well, calling her a "fake". As Hilary Faye flees with the others in pursuit, Dean suddenly arrives with other teenagers from Mercy House. Dean is surprised, but not upset, by Mary\'s pregnancy; he meets Patrick warmly, and Mary is similarly accepting towards Dean\'s roommate/boyfriend Mitch. Pastor Skip tries to send the new arrivals back to Mercy House, but they refuse, and Mary and her friends support them. Suddenly, Hilary crashes her van into the school\'s huge effigy of Jesus. Realizing what she has done, she breaks down in tears of regret. Cassandra shows some sympathy towards Hilary, feeling sorry for her. As paramedics arrive to the accident scene, Mary abruptly goes into labor and is taken to the hospital. In her hospital room, Mary\'s and Dean\'s friends and family crowd around the baby girl, while Pastor Skip waits outside debating whether to come in. In a voice-over, Mary tells the audience how she has returned to believing in a God who loves and helps the ones that love and help others in need.'] ["Trish Devereaux , an 18 year old teen decides to throw a slumber party while her parents are away and their neighbor Mr. Contant  is given the job of checking in on the girls during the night.

Eli, who is the ghost, and the others tag everyone, leaving the unnamed girl the winner. As Sandy tells her that she\'s won, the girl asks if she remembers her.

However, before she can get out of the water, she sees the girl floating lifelessly in front of her. Leaning down to see if the girl is okay, Layla is pulled into the water and drowned by the girl, who is revealed to be a demon-like incarnation of the unnamed girl who had disappeared the night before. Meanwhile, Chad arrives at Sandy and Eli\'s house with a different girl in tow, candy striper Cecilia . Looking on in disgust, Sandy asks what would Layla think, with Chad replying, "Who?"

After bartering his paycheck for the ring, T.J. is asked to check the safety on machines one, two, and three before going home. As he is alone, he opts to smoke a little pot before doing so.

Leaving the store, the group gets into Eli\'s Jeep with Sandy asking Jake where his bike went, to which responds that he had left it at her house. Once on the road, Sandy becomes even more confused when her stuff and the beach gear are gone, but her friends look at her confusingly, asking why they would be taking a boogie board to the mountains for spring break. Just then, Sandy yells at Eli to pull the car over, with Sandy getting out to look at Chad\'s car, battered and dirty in a junkyard. However, for some strange reason, no one but Sandy remembers who Chad is, and they soon drive to T.J.\'s house, which appears vacant and in ruin, the apparent scene of some unknown crime of some sort, as there is caution tape around the house and yard. As Sandy goes into the house with her boyfriend Jake and her brother Eli, the other girls, Lex and Hannah, get into an argument in the car. At the same time, Sandy begins to remember the unnamed girl from the graveyard as her friend when she was little, but nothing more. Later, Lex is killed by what appears to be undead versions of her murdered friends, with Sandy witnessing her demise.

Eli, who doesn\'t remember Jake, picks up a shaken Sandy. Sandy cries over her dead boyfriend, and Eli begins to realize that they are being erased in time, just like the rhyme they sang before playing the game in the graveyard. After heading home, Sandy, whose parents believe she has become depressed and suicidal, is sedated and taken to the hospital. While there, Eli is attacked and killed by the undead versions of his murdered friends. As Sandy is sedated again once at the hospital, she asks for Eli, of whom her parents have no recollection at all. Asking if Eli is a friend of hers, Sandy\'s parents tells the doctor that she has no friends. Later, Sandy dreams of a time where she and her friends played a scary prank on Angela , who had a seizure in front of the convent after knocking her head into the door. It is soon revealed that the little girl at the beginning of the film is a young Sandy, and the girl who mysteriously vanished and who has been committing the murders is, in fact, Angela. Sandy awakes and, recalling the rhyme to "kill the ghost or seal your fate," goes to Angela\'s room and switches off her life support. Leaving the room, she hears beats from Angela\'s cardiac monitor and returns to the room, only to find Angela sitting up in her bed. Sandy is then chased up to the roof by the ghosts of her friends, and encounters the young version of Angela. Despite a failed attempt to reason with her, Sandy falls from the roof of the hospital. The film ends with Angela "miraculously" awaking from her coma, while Sandy is revealed to have taken her place in a coma of her own. The mystery about Eli & the friends is not revealed whether they were imaginary people or real.'] ["Seven sorority sisters, Katey  Morgan , Stevie , Liz , Vicki , Jeanie , and Diane  pull a prank on their strict house mother, Mrs. Slater, who is known for carrying a sharp walking cane.

While going through his rigorous process, Devon also finds time to romance an upperclassman dancer, Laila . College life starts well for Devon, as he has the girl and a spot on the field. Things begin to sour when Sean , Devon\'s percussion leader, begins to grow weary of Devon\'s cocky attitude. Sean later challenges Devon to take a solo in his first game, believing the freshman will panic and be embarrassed in front of everyone. Sean is shocked when Devon takes the solo and is subsequently humiliated. This sets up some tension in the drumline which is exacerbated when Dr. Lee is told by President Wagner , the school\'s president, to change his focus from music to entertainment or lose his funding. Lee does not want to give Devon more playing time because he feels Devon\'s attitude and respect are lacking. The situation further deteriorates when it is revealed that Devon cannot read music. Devon is demoted to P4 by Dr. Lee until he learns, then later put back on P1 when Wagner pressures Dr. Lee to do so. However, after inflaming a melee with a visiting band at A&T\'s homecoming game after Devon plays on an opposing band member\'s drum, Devon is finally kicked out of the band by Dr. Lee. The fight also harms his relationship with Laila as she is embarrassed to introduce him to her parents, who attended the game and thought of Devon as a hoodlum. Devon contacts A&T\'s rival school Morris Brown College, to discuss playing for their band next season. Mr. Wade , Brown\'s band leader, says that Devon does not need to know how to read music and will likely get a full scholarship and a good position on the drumline. When Wade wants to know what Dr. Lee is planning for the BET Big Southern Classic , Devon realizes that his heart and honor are still with the A&T band. He rejects the scholarship offer from the rival band and returns to A&T. Though Devon is still not playing for the band, he cannot give up his drumming. He is sent cassette tapes from his estranged father and gets some ideas for new drum arrangements. He and Sean have a final confrontation that clears the air and they begin to work together. The two present their idea for an entrance cadence to Dr. Lee who decides they will be used during the Classic. Devon helps the drumline prepare and patches up his relationship with Laila. Lee also tells Devon that he can guarantee him a full return to the band next year. At the Classic, the bands are shown performing a mixture of popular songs. Morris Brown\'s band even gets rapper Petey Pablo to perform during their routine. A&T is not fazed by this and performs their mix of retro and current sounds. A tie results and the Morris Brown and A&T drumlines face off. Dr. Lee tells Devon he can play for this face-off, showing his faith in Devon\'s improved character and in thanks for all the hard work he has done in getting the band ready for the Classic. Morris Brown goes first and A&T responds. Morris Brown\'s second cadence includes their snares moving forward and playing on the A&T drums , then throwing down their sticks. The A&T line manages to hold their composure in the face of the insult. They play their cadence and in the middle throw down their sticks, mimicking the Morris Brown actions, but then the entire line pulls out another set of sticks and continues playing. They end their routine in the faces of the Morris Brown drumline, but instead of playing on their drums, the line all drop their sticks onto the other drumline\'s drums. The judges award the win to A&T.'] ['Abel Plenkov , a man who suffers from multiple personality disorder and schizophrenia and whose alter ego is \'The Riverton Ripper\' murders his pregnant wife and counselor Dr. Blake.

The player of the game, Loomis Crowley, quits playing and calls his friend Hutch  to see if he would come over and play the new game with him, revealed to be Stay Alive. Hutch tells him that they will get together that weekend to play and the friends hang up. Loomis goes upstairs and finds his roommates having sex and tells them he found them dead in the game. Loomis\' roommates brush it off and he leaves to bed. Loomis is woken up by a strange nightmare and goes downstairs for a snack. He is confronted by an unknown assailant and runs back upstairs only to find his roommates slaughtered. He backs away horrified and a chain is clasped around his neck and he is knocked off the staircase banister and hung on the chain, the same way he died in the game. The next day at work, while talking with his boss and friend Miller , Hutch receives a phone call informing him that Loomis is dead. At the funeral, Loomis\' sister, Emma, gives Hutch a bag containing some of Loomis\' possessions, including some video games. At the funeral, a blonde girl named Abigail  introduces herself as a close friend to Loomis\'s roommate. After the funeral, Hutch goes to an internet cafe owned and operated by his girlfriend and best friend, October , and her brother, Phineas . Hutch hands October the bag containing Loomis\' possessions, and Phineas eventually finds the video game, Stay Alive which they decide to play as a group that night. That night another friend of Hutch, Swink  arrives at Hutch\'s house, followed shortly by October, Phineas, and Abigail and they begin setting up their gaming equipment. Later, when everything is ready, they start up the game, with Miller playing online from his office. To start the game, the players recite a passage, "The Prayer of Elizabeth", during the game’s intro, which they say out loud . After a few hours of gaming, in which October reveals that spirits in the game cannot cross wild roses, Miller’s character is stabbed in the throat by the same woman in red who had killed Loomis, who is revealed to be Elizabeth Bathory. The group then decides to call it a night, but as Miller prepares to leave his office, he is killed in the same way as his character. When Hutch returns to work the next day, he is informed of Miller’s death and questioned by two detectives, Thibodeaux and King. Afterwards, he returns to the Internet cafe, joining his friends, while Phineus is playing the game.

While talking with the group, Hutch makes connections between the deaths of Miller and Loomis and their characters and runs back to the cafe to stop Phineas from playing. When they arrive they find Phineas instead getting high, having paused the game before he was killed. After doing some research, Hutch calls everyone together to reveal he knows how people are dying. October then says she believes him and reveals all she knows about Elizabeth Bathory.

Thibodeaux informs Hutch of his connections to the murders and that he is becoming a suspect. In the game, King\'s character’s head is ripped in half before Hutch can shut the game off. October, Hutch, Swink, and Abigail all decide to find a way to put an end to the games curse. Later, while investigating the game himself, King is brutally killed in his pickup truck, the same way he died in the game. Hutch and Abigail decide to go to Loomis\'s house, where Hutch reveals to her his fear of fire, stemming from his father murdering his mother by setting their house of fire with her asleep inside. They find the address of Stay Alive’s developer, Jonathan Malkus  hidden in Loomis\' computer. They proceed to go to his mansion, and, assuming no one is home, they go in. While exploring the house, finding dolls of Bathory and a black carriage in the barn, they are confronted by Malkus. They explain to Malkus the deaths and their connections to his game. He is shocked about the events and tells them that the game is based on the legend of Elizabeth Bathory. He sends them to a local author who wrote a book about Bathory called The Lady of Blood. Hutch and Abigail meet the author in a cafe and she tells them the legends of Elizabeth Bathory. They learn that she was walled up in the tower on her plantation as punishment for her gruesome acts, vowing to one day return and seek revenge on all men, women, and children. Abigail inquires as to whether or not Bathory could be summoned and the author rebuffs her, telling them both that she hopes they know better than to toy with the evil of Elizabeth Bathory. Meanwhile, October and Swink are doing investigating of their own. October calls Hutch and informs him the only way to kill The Countess is by burning her body, after first trapping her soul in her body by driving three nails into her: one in her heart, one in her throat, and another in her head. Swink then announces, after seeing a newscast, that detective King is dead, and that the group are now suspects. They all flee, meeting at Loomis’ house to formulate a plan. October goes outside to smoke and sees Bathory in a house under construction. Entering the house alone, she tries to confront the Countess in revenge for the death of her brother. Grabbing a nail gun she attempts to fire the nails in The Countess. Unfortunately the nails must be put into her physical body and not her spirit. October attempts to flee but The Countess clasps her ankle with a chain and lifts her up, slitting October\'s throat. The others arrive to late, with Hutch cradeling Octobers body, mourning inconsolably. After they leave Hutch informs Abigail and Swink of his belief that, by reciting "The Prayer of Elizabeth", they inadvertently summoned her vengeful spirit. They all decide to investigate inside Malkus’ mansion with Swink deciding to stay behind and play the game as both a distraction for The Countess, and as an aid to the others. Hutch and Abigail go inside the mansion, where they find various clues about The Countess, revealing that Malkus\'s house is actually the Bathory plantation. Swink also reveals, through testing, that whatever happens in the game will happen in the real world. Abigail finds Elizabeth\'s diary in a secret room, revealing it is full of the names of all the girls Elizabeth killed in her lifetime. The spirit of Bathory traps Abigail and is about to kill her when Hutch saves her with the help of Swink via the game. Swink, however, is then seemingly killed by Bathory after he is chased by the same carriage that killed Phineas. After a run-in with The Countess’ black carriage, which they survive by collecting several wild roses, Hutch and Abigail locate Elizabeth’s altar in a large Mausoleum, which leads them to an underground entrance to Bathory\'s black tower. After escaping from several spirits of Bathory\'s victims and them Bathory herself they arrive at the door to the tower. Hutch enters and suddenly, the door slams shut leaving Abigail trapped. Hutch panics and tries to open the door, but she pleads with him to go ahead, as The Countess closes in on her. Hutch leaves her with a rose and proceeds on without her. When Hutch reaches the top of the tower, he finds The Countess\' body completely preserved. He hammers in the nails, trapping her spirit in her body just as she is about to kill Abigail. Now back in her body, the Countess attacks Hutch. He uses the reflective surface of his laptop as a mirror, showing The Countess her reflection, which drives her mad. Hutch then manages to set The Countess on fire, but is trapped in the room as it begins to go up in flames and his fear of fire begins to overtake him. As all seems lost, Swink and Abigail burst into the room carrying a small rose bush, Swink having survived due to stumbling into the roses while being chased by The Countess. The three of them then proceed to escape the plantation as Elizabeth\'s body burns. The movie ends in a video game store, where it shows that Stay Alive is being released. An employee takes a copy, puts it in the PlayStation 2, and as the game begins the group reciting Elizabeth\'s prayer is heard.'] ['Keisuke Miyagi travels to the city of Boston to attend a commendation for Japanese American soldiers who had fought in the 442nd Regimental Combat Team during World War II.

Tom chooses to part ways with Cindy and flees with his children to an undisclosed location. While visiting Edna R. Penhall Elementary School, President Baxter Harris  receives news of the alien attack. Unfortunately, Harris is more interested by the reading of "My Pet Duck" and fails to respond appropriately. The situation only worsens when his aide explains that the duck dies, and the aide explains that the aliens are vaporizing people, which leads for the president to exclaim that all off these children\'s parents could be dead, which culminates in a violent riot by the children. On his way out the president asks his aide to remind him to sign the abortion bill. Later, at an emergency session of the United Nations, Harris follows a round of offensive jokes with the unveiling of a weapon designed to combat the aliens. Scientists have modified the heat ray into having the opposite effect of destroying bodies, leaving only clothes behind. The UN gets an unexpected and quite unwelcome demonstration when Harris unwittingly causes the ray to render everybody stark naked, beginning with himself. Cindy reunites with her old friend Brenda Meeks , now a local reporter despite having died in the previous film. Meanwhile, Mahalik and CJ are working as sewer inspectors, but when they get out of the sewer a horde of Zombie like people start to attack them, but they easily fight back and one of them is Malaik\'s grandma, he keep\'s telling her how much he loves her while beating her up at the same time and throwing her into the sewers at the end . Cindy and Brenda manage to find the last working car and follow the directions left by Toshio. Soon, they discover a mysterious village which resembles a pseudo-Amish community. Unfortunately, they are captured and taken into a court to have their fate decided by village leader Henry Hale . During the trial, Hale\'s blind daughter, Holly , stumbles into the courtroom thinking she\'s alone she strips and defecates loudly in front of everyone. To the consternation of the crowded courtroom, Hale rules that Cindy and Brenda may stay in the village, but never leave. In a nearby field strewn with red weed, Tom and his children still are driving the car while most people try to steal it, which succeeds after a man point\'s a gun to his head and they switch the wrong items. Later they run into a battle between the US military and the triPods. Robbie decides to join the fight, excited by the graphic violence. While Tom tries to dissuade him, Michael Jackson tries to persuade Rachel to come along – but Tom manages to stop her in time, leaving the singer to be repeatedly disintegrated until only his plastic nose remains. Tom and Rachel flee into a house guarded by the lunatic Oliver , but their respite is short-lived when father and daughter are captured by a triPod. Back in the village, Henry gets stabbed by the mentally challenged village idiot Ezekiel . A dying Henry explains to Cindy and Brenda that he is the father of Toshio, who was killed during the mass accident at Cindy’s boxing match. However, various events conspire against Henry revealing the full story, finally culminating in Cindy and Brenda being caught by the Command triPod. The main characters wake up in the same bathroom from the opening. Cindy and Brenda find themselves wearing "Venus Fly Traps" and Tom wearing an absurd device designed to shoot a pole up his behind. Then Billy appears on the TV and tells them Cindy has 60 seconds to retrieve the key. After much prompting, Cindy realises that she has to retrieve the key from behind her eye – which she does without trouble, since the key was behind a glass eye she got following a “bad bar fight in \'96”. Then both Rachel and Robbie come down from the ceiling, to be sliced into pieces unless Tom holds onto their rope, leaving him open to another, ultimately lethal torture device where his kids would be saved but he would suffer a terrible death. Moments before his imminent death, Cindy notices the toilet that has a heart drawn on it and discovers pictures of Billy with Henry\'s wife and Toshio. Realising that Billy was the boy\'s biological father and the entire invasion is revenge for his son’s death, Cindy pleads him to call off the invasion. After seeing how far Tom would go to save his children\'s lives at the cost of his own, Billy spares their lives and grudgingly apologizes for killing millions of people and allows them to depart from the bathroom. In an epilogue set nine months later, Brenda gives birth to the child of Billy\'s brother Zoltar, CJ and Mahalik resume their relationship, and President Harris is seen sleeping with a duck. James Earl Jones narrates mankind\'s victory through love – before being run over by a passing bus. Meanwhile, Tom appears on Oprah, crazy for attention. Ultimately, following various increasingly destructive antics: flipping, swinging, manically throwing Cindy off the stage with crazy love, breaking Oprah Winfrey\'s hands, hitting her with a chair and rushing towards the camera as the screen goes black.'] ['{{plot}} The film begins with a boy named Michael , a kid who has the hots for a beautiful girl named Jada , but is always rejected because Jada is stuck with a gangster, Lorenzo , and when Michael comes close to her, he is threatened with bodily harm by getting beat up by both Lorenzo and his homeboys, T-Bone  and Baby Boy .

The family moves in with Lucy\'s father , a cantankerous and eccentric old man who lives on the outskirts of town, and enjoys taxidermy as a hobby. The center of town life is the Boardwalk, which is plastered with flyers of missing people. While Lucy gets a job at a local video store run by a conservative man named Max , Michael becomes fascinated by Star , a beautiful young woman he spots at the Boardwalk one night, and who lives with David , the mysterious leader of a local gang. Meanwhile, in the local comic book store, Sam meets brothers Edgar and Alan Frog , a pair of self-proclaimed vampire hunters, who warn him that Santa Carla is under attack from vampires, and give him horror comics to teach him about the threat . Michael finally talks to Star the following night, but also encounters David, who provokes Michael into a motorcycle race, which almost results in him being baited over the edge of a sea cliff. David then invites Michael to the gang\'s lair, a once-luxurious hotel sunken by an earthquake, where he is put through an unsettling initiation that includes drinking from an ornate wine bottle. Star tells Michael not to drink from the bottle, as it is actually full of blood, but Michael does not believe her, and takes a sip.

Star then suddenly arrives, flying in through the window, and revealing that she too is a half-vampire. Michael realises that the wine he drank on his first night in the gang\'s lair was in fact David\'s blood. It emerges that David had intended for Michael to be Star\'s first kill, sealing her fate as a vampire. Star, however, says that she too wants to be cured. The next day, a weakening Michael leads Sam and the Frog brothers to the gang\'s lair, where they intend to kill the vampires in their sleep.  The staking of one vampire  awakens David and the two others, and the boys barely escape with their lives, but manage to rescue Star and Laddie, a recently abducted half-vampire child. That evening, while Lucy is on a date with Max, and Grandpa is out of the house, the teens arm themselves with weapons based on traditional defenses against vampires. David and the gang attack, and are each killed in a spectacular fashion. Michael faces off with David, and ultimately impales him on a pair of mounted deer antlers. However, Michael, Star and Laddie do not transform back to normal with David\'s death, as they had hoped. Lucy and Max then return home, and Max is revealed to be the Head Vampire after all. He informs the boys that to invite a vampire into one\'s house  renders one powerless, which explains why Sam and the Frog brothers\' tests failed to work on him. Max\'s objective all along was to get Lucy to be a "mother" for his "lost boys". But his grand plan is thwarted when Grandpa suddenly crashes his jeep through the wall of the house, impaling Max on the wooden fence posts he is carrying in the back of the jeep, and causing him to explode in the fireplace. Michael, Star, and Laddie then return to normal. The film ends with Grandpa calmly and casually retrieving a drink from the fridge, seemingly oblivious to the carnage around him. He then declares, "One thing about living in Santa Carla I never could stomach...all the damn vampires", revealing that he has known about the vampires all along. Michael and Sam look at each other in disbelief.'] ["The film is centred around three teenagers in South Wales and follows their lives inside and outside their homes. The film has many similarities with Larry Clark's Kids, such as drugs, sex, and dysfunction through the teenagers point of view."] ['Set in the South Bronx, the film follows the lives of a pair of brothers and their group of friends, all of whom are devoted to various elements of early hip hop culture. Kenny Kirkland ([[Guy Davis  is a budding disc jockey and MC, and his younger brother Lee  is a hardcore b-boy who dances with Beat Street Breakers . Kenny\'s best friends are Ramon , a graffiti artist known by his tag, "Ramo", and Chollie , his self-styled manager/promoter. The film begins with the main characters preparing for a house party set in an abandoned apartment building, where Kenny is the featured DJ. An uninvited Lee and his breakdancing friends crash the party, and nearly get tangled into a battle with a rival troupe, the Bronx Rockers . The battle of mostly words is broken up by Henri , a squatter who lives in the building and is befriended by Kenny, Chollie, Ramon, and Luis . Kenny has dreams of performing in New York City\'s top nightclubs. No club is bigger than the Roxy, and on one visit he crosses paths with Tracy Carlson , a college music student and composer. A breakdance battle between the Breakers and Rock Steady ensues, and Tracy admires Lee\'s performance. She then invites him to audition for a television show focusing on dancing. Lee, Kenny, and their crew arrive during a dance rehearsal, and Lee gives his performance only to find out he won\'t be on television. Protecting his brother\'s interests, Kenny rips into Tracy for leading Lee on; Ramon steals a videotape of Lee\'s dance as the crew walk out. A remorseful Tracy then shows up at the Kirkland home to apologize. Lee was not home but Kenny was, working on a mix tape. Tracy clarifies her story, saying that she did not promise to Lee that he was going to be on the TV show. She then takes an interest in Kenny\'s mixing and the two find common ground. Kenny and Tracy then head into the subway, where they meet up with Lee, Ramon, and Luis spray painting an abandoned station platform. They pack up and leave when they hear noises, thinking it may be the police; it turned out to be a rogue graffiti artist known as Spit who defaces Ramo\'s work  by spraying his tag over it. As the group take the train back uptown, Kenny and Tracy break away and spend the rest of the evening together, striking up a romance while walking and talking. Chollie talks Kenny into a guest spot at the Burning Spear, a club run by DJ Kool Herc. Kenny not only spins but presents a special Christmas-themed skit performed by the Treacherous Three, Doug E. Fresh, and the Magnificent Force. The crowd\'s positive reaction convinces Kool Herc to invite Kenny back. But both Kenny and Chollie see the regular gig as a stepping stone to their bigger goal. They return to the Roxy, where auditions are being held for new talent. Chollie convinces Kenny to let him do the talking, and waits for the auditions to end before he succeeds in getting the talent scout to check out Kenny at the Burning Spear. The scout keeps his word, and is impressed enough that he offers Kenny a performance on New Year\'s Eve. Tracy offers to help Kenny out by allowing him to work on a computer keyboard system at her studio. However, Kenny accidentally presses a wrong button and deletes his work. Stubborn and frustrated, Kenny leaves the studio, saying he had enough material for New Year\'s Eve. Meanwhile, Ramon is feeling pressure from two sources. His father Domingo , who despises his graffiti, wants him to find honest work, while his girlfriend Carmen , the mother of his son, longs for them to be together as a family. Ramon eventually gets a job in a hardware store, and he then takes Carmen and their baby to live with him in Henri\'s building. But Ramon does not stop thinking of the subway trains that are his canvas. When he sees a white-painted one pass him by, he vows to put his mark on it. Later that evening, Ramon and Kenny find the train and proceed to paint one side of the lead car. As they work on the second side of the car, Ramon hears noises, and they discover the rogue graffiti artist Spit, defacing the completed side. Ramon and Kenny chase Spit through the tunnel and into a station, and a fight ensues. Spit sprays paint in Ramon\'s eye, and both men tussle on the roadbed before they roll onto the electrified third rail, which kills them instantly. As the group mourn the death of their friend, Kenny considers not performing for the New Year\'s Eve show at the Roxy. However, with the help of Tracy and despite initial reluctance from Chollie, Kenny turns his big break into a celebration of Ramon\'s life. The show is the film\'s grand finale, starting with a rap performance by Kenny while images of Ramon and his work were shown on a screen in the background. Kenny is followed by Grandmaster Melle Mel & the Furious Five and a Bronx gospel choir, and backed by dancers and breakdancers.'] ['Stacy Collins  is a shy 16-year-old high school student who secretly had been in love with Bobby Tennison  for two years. She is surprised when he shows a romantic interest in her, considering he is a senior wrestler and the most popular guy in school. They soon start dating and find out that both their fathers had abandoned them. Stacy is upset that her mother is dating men who treat her very badly. After a few weeks of dating, Bobby starts showing possessive behavior. He is jealous whenever another guy approaches Stacy or talks about her inappropriately, and he doesn\'t want her to hang out with her friends when they are together. At first, she doesn\'t suspect that there is anything wrong, because he immediately apologizes after getting mad at her and tells her that he loves her and gives her gifts. After having sex with Bobby for the first time, she promises to him that they will be together forever. She also agrees not to hang out with other people anymore if he is not present. At school, boys start to notice her when Nicki convinces her to wear a mid-thigh high skirt for Bobby and the boys make comments about her looking hot. This outrages him, who furiously calls Stacy a slut and demands that she wear proper clothes and forces her to change the skirt right there in the school bathroom and into some track pants. She tries to explain that she was only dressing up for him, but he gets mad at her and slams her into the wall. Back at home, her mother, Laura , worries that she is spending too much of her time with him, but she assures her that she loves him. Meanwhile, her best friends, Nicki  and Val , also grow concerned about her relationship with him. Nicki is informed that he used to beat up his former girlfriends and maintains a history of being abusive in his past relationships and she notices that Stacy has several bruises on her body. She confronts her, but Stacy becomes angry and defensive. By accident, Stacy meets Bobby\'s mother; he catches them talking to each other and becomes furious and violent. Upset, she refuses to see him again and later takes it out on her mother, calling her irresponsible. He later wins her trust back by telling her about the alcoholism that runs in his family. They are happy for a while, but trouble begins again when he sees her talking to another guy at the school dance. He pulls her outside into the parking lot and slaps her for talking to another guy, and they are caught by Nicki. She then confronts Stacy about how bad he is treating her but Stacy defends Bobby saying he\'s been through a lot and when Nicki flat out says Bobby doesn\'t love her , Stacy then says, "Then you don\'t know what love is!" Stacy refuses to see the truth, but later realizes that he isn\'t treating her right and she ends their relationship. He tries to win her back by offering for them to just be friends, but they are soon estranged when he hears that she was talking to another boy at a birthday party and therefore slaps her again despite her no longer being his girlfriend. Later that night, Bobby, accompanied by his friend Vince Fortner , convinces her to get into his car for a ride. He drives to the woods and walks off with her to be alone; and the next day, she is missing. Most people guess that she hitchhiked and was murdered, but Laura suspects that Bobby has something to do with it after she finds Stacy\'s purse in his room. Nicki is also convinced that he is responsible for Stacy\'s disappearance and asks Carla , a witness on the night that she disappeared, for information. Her reluctance to tell what happened frustrates Nicki. Accompanied by Laura, she goes to the police, informing Laura and Detective Anderson how abusive Stacy\'s relationship with Bobby was. Carla eventually talks to them as well, admitting that Bobby and Vince took Stacy to the lake. Bobby and Vince are arrested and Bobby blames Vince for Stacy\'s disappearance. When confronted by this lie, he admits that Bobby was the one last seen with her and later told him that \'if he can\'t have her, no one\'s gonna\'. Detective Anderson is then convinced Bobby killed her when Stacy ended the relationship and when he confronts him, he admits that he slit her throat when she refused to get back together with him and then threw her body in the lake. Stacy\'s body is soon found and Laura and Nicki are left in tears. A court trial follows with all the friends finally stepping up and exposing the abusive ways that Bobby treated Stacy, with Nicki saying how she deperately wanted to oust Bobby, but was afraid of losing Stacy\'s friendship if she were to say what Bobby was doing to her. Bobby is eventually found guilty and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. The judge  tells the witnesses to tell someone if a friend is being abused instead of standing by and doing nothing implying how it could have saved Stacy from getting killed. Later, a distraught Nicki clears out Stacy\'s locker and cries hysterically as she looks at the pictures of them, remembering their friendship and guiltily wishing that she\'d done something sooner so as to save Stacy from Bobby\'s wrath. The movie ends with Nicki and her boyfriend leaving a bouquet of roses on the sand at the lake in honor of Stacy\'s memory.'] ['The film starts in 1963, with liberal-minded Lydia, and her 14-year-old son Sam.

Egerton , the janitor, has allowed two groups of teenagers to bowl against one another after hours. The "prep", Steve , is still bitter after his best friend Jamie , the "jock", had sex with Lisa , a girl with whom Steve was smitten and even took to their senior prom. After Steve and his friends Joey , Patrick  and A.J.  harass the "tranny", Sam , they are chastised by Jamie. This leads to a brawl between Steve\'s team and Jamie\'s. Lisa breaks up the fight by dropping a bowling ball on Steve\'s foot just as Steve is about to kick Jamie again. Egerton, brandishing a shotgun, tells the teenagers to leave and they can continue their tournament the following night. Lisa, having forgot her purse in the arcade, returns to find Steve and his friends waiting for her. Steve proceeds to violently rape Lisa while the others watch. Egerton is oblivious to Lisa\'s cries for help, as he is downstairs cleaning up the mess the teenagers made. After he is finished raping Lisa, Steve leaves the room. A.J. and Joey rape Lisa on the pool table while Steve is gone. Patrick, who believed the three were only going to "scare" Lisa, refuses to participate in the rape. Steve returns with a bowling pin and prepares to insert it into Lisa\'s vagina before Patrick intervenes. Steve retorts by giving Patrick the pin and ordering him to do it himself. Patrick refuses to do so at first but complies when Steve threatens to do the same to him. The four leave Lisa on the pool table, naked and barely conscious. The following night, the two groups arrive at the bowling alley to continue their tournament. Steve is joined by his "bitches", Julia  and Hannah . Jamie arrives late with Lisa, who barely speaks. As the teams begin their first game of the night, Lisa suddenly gets on an elevator. She is confronted by Patrick, who says he\'s only at the bowling alley to apologize. Lisa doesn\'t believe him, and insists that he is only there to make sure that she hasn\'t contacted the police. The players notice a mystery player on the scoreboard, BBK, but believe it is just a glitch. Dave , one of Jamie\'s friends, meets Julia in the bar and pays for two beers she ordered. When he discovers that one of them belongs to Steve, he asks if he can urinate in it. Julia tells him that she doesn\'t care and that she dislikes Steve too but hangs out with him anyways because he\'s dating her friend Hannah. Julia follows Dave into the bathroom and the two begin to make out. A mysterious person wearing bowling attire exits one of the stalls while Dave and Julia are in the "69" position and forces Julia\'s head further onto Dave\'s penis while forcing Dave\'s head further between Julia\'s legs, suffocating them both. After they are dead, two strikes appear next to BBK on the scoreboard in the form of a skull and crossbones. The game continues and Sam excuses herself to the bathroom so she can "freshen up." The person who murdered Dave and Julia is hiding in one of the stalls when Sam enters the girls\' restroom and Sam, frightened by the noise coming from the stall, approaches it and is pulled inside. She tries to bargain with the killer, but the killer murders her by forcing a bowling pin down her throat. The killer lifts up Sam\'s skirt and, using the switchblade Sam tried to defend herself with, cuts Sam\'s penis lengthwise, giving her a "mangina." Ben  and Cindy  leave to have sex in a storage room upstairs, but Ben leaves Cindy alone to get a condom from the bathroom. He dies when the killer hits him over the head with a bowling pin and gouges his eyes out with a sharpened pin. The killer finds Cindy upstairs and strangles her to death with a pair of bowling sneakers. Downstairs, Hannah searches for Julia but dies when the killer crushes her head with two bowling balls. Joey goes back behind the pin setters to fix his team\'s, which they notice is broken. A.J. notices the strikes appearing next to BBK on the scoreboard and questions Egerton about it, who assures him that it is just a glitch. Egerton sends A.J. to an area currently being remodeled with an "out of order" sign to put on an automatic ball polisher that Joey broke earlier. A.J. turns the ball polisher on and finds it already fixed but dies when the killer uses it to wax his face off. Steve, noticing that something is amiss, leaves to find Joey behind the pin setters. Joey lies dead on the ground, headless. Steve is frightened by the killer, who bludgeons him with a bowling pin before sodomizing him with a sharpened pin. As Steve tries to crawl away, the killer smashes his head in with the bowling pin. Meanwhile, Sarah and Jamie continue their game. Jamie reaches into the ball return slot to find his bowling ball, instead discovering Joey\'s severed head. The two try desperately to escape the bowling alley before coming face to face with the killer. They run and hide in the basement, where they find their friends\' bodies. The killer appears with a shotgun and removes the bowling bag to reveal Egerton\'s face. Sarah discovers that Jamie knew about the murders of Steve, Joey and A.J. but not the others. Lisa appears, dressed up as well, revealing it was she that murdered Steve. Jamie explains that Lisa told her father, who turns out to be Egerton, about the rape and Egerton let Jamie in on the plan. When asked why he killed their friends too, Egerton explains that they didn\'t intervene when Lisa reentered the bowling alley and are therefore just as guilty. Another person dressed like the killer or "BBK", as Egerton goes on to explain, enters the basement and removes the bowling bag to reveal Patrick\'s face. Patrick explains that he confessed his involvement to Egerton and wanted to contact the police, but Egerton let him in on the plan instead and he was the person who murdered Joey and A.J., supposedly to make it up to her. Lisa is furious that her father allowed him to live so Egerton betrays Patrick and slits his throat with the switchblade he got from Sam. Jamie, realizing he\'s out of control, wrestles Egerton to the ground and, after a scuffle, blows his head clean off with the shotgun. Lisa cradles her father\'s body before grabbing the switchblade and trying to attack Jamie. Sarah grabs the shotgun and kills Lisa. Sarah shoots the locks off of the emergency doors and the two survivors escape the bowling alley. Traumatized and, above all, upset that Jamie did nothing to prevent the murders, Sarah turns the gun on him. The screen cuts to black and a gunshot is heard.'] ['The film follows the antics of head counsellor Tripper Harrison  and the counsellors-in-training  at Camp North Star, a cut-rate summer camp.

During one such robbery, the car’s owner catches the two in the act. They roll up the windows and lock the doors to prevent intrusion. Helplessly trapped inside the troublesome vehicle by a mob that has now closed in around them, the pair forces a clear path through the crowd by brandishing a gun, before making their escape into the street. However, the stolen car only proves to be the first step in a more elaborate scheme. Spotting an attractive waitress named Ángela at a local cafeteria, Pablo is immediately captivated by the receptive  young woman, who soon becomes his lover, promising to stay together always. Pablo teaches Ángela to shoot a gun and, subsequently, inducts her into their gang after an afternoon of makeshift target shooting. The gang now consists of four members: Pablo, Meca, Ángela, and Sebastian or "Sebas". Sebas has joined the group to help in a series of more ambitious thefts, but he is initially unhappy with the presence of a girl in the band. Pablo, with Meca’s support, assures him that Ángela can hold her own. In the first robbery, that of a factory office on the outskirts of Madrid, Ángela, disguised as a boy with a mustache, serves as a lookout. In the second holdup, she shoots one of the guards who has fired at the gang’s car. At the conclusion of each of these robberies, Meca brings the getaway car, usually a stolen one, to a deserted area and set it ablaze. He stands by the side of the fire and enjoys viewing the flames. Alternately spending their idle time at discothèques and video arcades, acting on their impulsive whims, and succumbing to the intoxication of drug use, the emboldened quartet begins to stage an ever-escalating series of hold-ups throughout the city. Their share of the money from the two successful robberies enables Ángela and Pablo to buy a new apartment on the outskirts of the city. It is from this location that the gang plans a third robbery, the assault on a branch bank in one of the more congested middle-class neighborhoods of Madrid. During this robbery, Sebas kills one of the guards and is, in turn, gunned down outside the bank by a squad of police who have surrounded the area. Pablo, Meca, and Ángela manage to make a getaway, but Pablo has been seriously wounded and is bleeding profusely. Ángela brings him back to the apartment to nurse him while Meca disposes of the getaway car in the usual manner. However, the black cloud of smoke attracts a police helicopter and Meca is killed as he resists arrest. Understanding the seriousness of Pablo’s wound, Ángela calls a doctor who, upon arriving at the apartment, confirms the gravity of Pablo’s condition. He has been shot in the liver and must be brought to a hospital if he is to survive. Refusing, she offers him a large bundle of cash if he will treat Pablo right there. Taking the money in his black satchel, the physician promises to return shortly with instruments for surgery. Hours pass, but the doctor does not come back. Pablo, who remains unconscious, lies immobile on the bed. He stops breathing while Ángela sits in the darkened room staring at him. When she realizes he is dead, she fills her own duffel bag with the remaining money from the robbery and walks of the apartment. She disappears into the shadows of the approaching night walking towards the city.'] ["Two sisters, 11-year-old Amanda  and 16-year-old Laurel , run away from several foster homes, sleeping wherever they can, including in model homes.

When she sees a flyer advertising a babysitting job, Samantha calls the number and leaves a message on the answering machine. The pay phone rings after she has hung up, and Mr. Ulman  arranges to pick her up outside the Student Affairs office. However, he never shows up. Ulman leaves a message with Samantha\'s roommate, and when Samantha calls him back, he apologizes for standing her up and offers her $100 to babysit that night. Seeing the money as the only way to afford her first month\'s rent, Samantha agrees, and her friend Megan  drives her to the house which is in the country. Megan is very skeptical, and begs Samantha to let her stay with her. When they get to the house, Ulman is very evasive when Megan asks him basic questions about who he is. He mentions the evening\'s lunar eclipse and how the town is the best place on Earth to see it. Eventually, he confesses that there is no child to babysit, only his mother. He agrees to pay Samantha $400, stressing that it was very important to have a sitter for the night. Megan is furious with Samantha for agreeing to stay. She does not trust Ulman, especially once he admitted to lying. As she drives away, she is so flustered that she pulls over to light a cigarette. A man  appears out of nowhere to offer her a light, visibly frightening her. After she lights up, she asks where he came from. He asks, "You\'re not the babysitter?" When she admits that she is not, he unexpectedly kills her by shooting her in the head, then calmly picks the lit cigarette from her fingers to finish it. Back at the house, Ulman promises that his mother is independent enough that Samantha might never even see her, and he mentions twice that there is a phone number on the fridge for a pizza place.

After a few bites of the pizza, she throws it out and tries to wash the taste out of her mouth. At the sink, she hears someone else running a tap somewhere in the house.

When she wakes up, she is tied to a satanic altar in the basement. The Ulmans and the stranger are there as well as a deformed priestess, all of them in hooded cloaks. The priestess draws a pentagram on Samantha\'s belly with blood and then pours more blood down her mouth. Samantha manages to free herself, stabbing Mr. Ulman and poking the stranger in the eye. She runs upstairs and trips over Megan\'s body in the kitchen. The stranger chases her up to the second story of the house where he shoots her in the arm. As he prepares to finish her off, she slashes his throat and flees into the attic. Mrs. Ulman appears devastated by the death of the man, and enters the attic. She tells Samantha that it is too late to do anything, threatening "it will work in spite of you". Samantha stabs her in the back as she prays for help.

He explains that he is simply a messenger for someone else. He asks Samantha to listen to the voices in her head and realize that there is no way to fight them. Samantha then shoots herself in the head. The film ends in a hospital room, where Samantha is recovering. A nurse tends to her and says, "Don\'t worry, you\'re gonna be just fine." Then, laying a hand on Samantha\'s stomach, she adds, "Both of you."'] ['In the Victorian period, two young cousins, Richard and Emmeline Lestrange, and a galley cook, Paddy Button  survive a shipwreck in the South Pacific and reach a lush tropical island. Paddy cares for the small children and forbids them by "law" from going to the other side of the island, as he found evidence of remains of bloody human sacrifices. He tells them the bogeyman lives there as a way to make sure they do not go there. He also warns them against eating a certain scarlet berry Emmeline has found which is deadly. Paddy soon dies after a drunken binge and his body is discovered by Richard and Emmeline. Now alone, the children go to another part of the island and rebuild their home. They survive solely on their resourcefulness, skills that Paddy had taught them and the bounty of their remote paradise. Years pass and they both grow into tall, strong and beautiful teenagers. They live in their hut, spending their days together fishing, swimming, and diving for pearls. Richard and Emmeline  begin to fall in love, although this is emotionally stressful for them because of their lack of education on human sexuality, and are unable to express their physical attraction for one another. Emmeline is frightened after she begins her first menstrual period, and is nervous when Richard wants to inspect her for a cut. Richard himself has many questions about what is happening to them as they begin to grow and develop, but has no means of getting answers. He wishes to hold and kiss her, but when she rejects him he goes off and masturbates. Emmeline, ever curious, goes to the other side of the island and discovers an impressive, Moai-like idol there. Instinctively recognizing that this is a holy place, she prays. Later she tells Richard that she thinks Paddy was wrong and the "bogeyman", who bleeds like Jesus, is actually God. However, Richard berates her for disobeying the "law". Sometime later, their relationship suffers a major blow when a ship appears for the first time in years. Richard\'s desire to leave comes into conflict with Emmeline\'s desire to stay, and she does not light the signal fire. As a result, the ship passes by without noticing them. Richard\'s fury leads him to kick her out of their hut. They make up for this fight after Emmeline is nearly killed upon stepping on a stonefish and Richard admits to his fear of losing her. Emmeline eventually recovers and after she regains her ability to walk, they go skinny dipping in the lagoon and then swim to shore. Still naked, Richard and Emmeline share some fruit in the vegetation overlooking the idol, and discover sexual intercourse, and then passionate love. Casting all their unease aside, they regularly make love from then on while occasionally spending their time together in the nude. Due to their regular sexual encounters though, Emmeline soon becomes pregnant. Although this is clear to the viewer, Richard and Emmeline themselves do not know about the truth of childbirth and human reproduction and simply assume that the physical changes in Emmeline\'s body is her getting fat. They are also stunned when they begin to feel the baby move inside Emmeline and simply assume its her stomach causing the movements. One night Emmeline goes missing. While Richard looks for her in the forest, he witnesses a human sacrifice committed by the natives of another island at the idol shrine where they sacrifice some enemy natives. As he flees, Richard hears Emmeline cry out and follows the sound just in time to help her give birth to a baby boy, whom they name Paddy, in remembrance of Paddy Button. Later on, frustrated at not knowing how to feed the baby, Emmeline holds him on her arms to appease his crying, and learns how to feed him as the baby instinctively starts sucking on her breast. The young parents spend their time playing with Paddy as he grows, teaching him how to swim, fish and build things and happily raising him. As the family plays, a ship led by Richard\'s father Arthur , approaches the island, and sees the family playing on the shore. As they are completely covered in mud, Arthur assumes these are natives, not the young couple they have been searching for all these years. Richard, having lost all of his desire to leave the island, agrees with Emmeline with an exchange of glances, and they let the ship pass. One day, the young family takes the lifeboat to visit their original homesite. While waiting for Richard, Emmeline and Paddy remain in the boat. Emmeline falls asleep and does not notice when Paddy brings a branch of the scarlet berries into the boat. She awakes as Paddy tosses one of the oars out. The tide was sweeping the boat out into the lagoon and Richard, hearing her calling, swims to her, followed closely by a shark. Emmeline throws the other oar at the shark, striking it and giving Richard just enough time to get in the boat. Though close to shore, they are unable to return or retrieve the oars without risking a shark attack. They paddle with their hands, but to no avail; the boat is caught in the current and drifts out to sea. After drifting for days in the boat, Richard and Emmeline awake to find Paddy eating the berries he picked. Realizing that these are the poisonous berries Paddy warned them about, they try to stop him, but he had already swallowed a few. Hopeless, Richard and Emmeline eat the berries as well, lying down to await death. A few hours later, Arthur\'s ship finds them floating in the boat. Arthur asks, "Are they dead?" and the ship\'s captain  answers, "No, sir. They\'re asleep." And Arthur is relieved.'] ["Rachel, a beautiful young artist, is murdered at her secluded lakefront house by a group of soulless killers.

Ronald continues playing "cool" by hanging out with the jocks and hot chicks. He takes Barbara to a dance at school, where he performs a dance he learned from the African Culture channel on television which he mistakenly believed to be American Bandstand.

He tells them about his game and instructs them to form teams. At first, the leaders refuse to play. However, rivalries between them lead all five to change their minds by the game\'s start time. The game works like this: # Teams are given an initial clue to solve. # When the clue is solved, it will lead to a location. # At that location they must find and solve another clue leading to another location and eventually the end. Leon, as "game master," keeps track of the teams locations with a giant map, and various radio equipment. The teams are supposed to call and check in at each clue . Starting at sundown, the five teams meet and are given envelopes with the first clue. They travel around Los Angeles, deciphering new clues in various locations, including the Griffith Observatory, a piano museum, the Pabst Blue Ribbon brewery, a restaurant, a mini golf course, the Los Angeles International Airport, and a video arcade. The first team to reach the final destination, a room in the Westin Bonaventure Hotel, wins the game. The movie focuses mainly on the struggle between the yellow and blue teams.

Ben and Virgil are the quintessential Asian Americans, seen as highly intelligent overachievers whose only goal is to gain acceptance into the highly prestigious Ivy League universities. In fact, Ben learns a new SAT vocabulary word every night through rote memorization and recitation. These words act as the dividers between different chapters of Ben's life. In reality, Ben reveals that he in fact uses his perfectionism in order to act out in other ways, such as toilet papering houses with Virgil and other petty crimes. Part of these activities include the purchase and return of computer equipment with Virgil, and Virgil's cousin Han Seoul-Oh  to earn easy money. Ben is involved in many of the school clubs, all of which are being used to pad his college application. He makes the basketball team, though he soon discovers that he is merely a bench player.

Later, the group, now intoxicated, arrive at a party, where they are accosted by a football player who mocks them for their perfect image. A fight results in Daric pulling out a gun, stopping the fight. At school the next day, news of the fight spreads around school and the four’s notoriety increases. Theories run rampant, including a possible link to the Chinese mafia. They gradually expand into more and more dangerous scams, such as the theft of computer parts from the school and eventually, drugs. They become users themselves, and Ben begins to develop a heavy cocaine habit. They also throw wild parties at Daric's house, which results in their lives running wildly out of control. Ben accompanies Steve to a batting cage after selling him drugs. Steve expresses to Ben that he knows he should be happy with what he has, but he is not since he feels stifled by the expectations that others have of him. On his birthday, Ben wakes up with a nosebleed as a result of his cocaine use. This is enough to scare him into changing his life. He meets the remainder of the group and tells them that he wants to quit. Daric agrees with him, expressing that their operation has become a full-time job. Daric presents a gun from the three of them to Ben, wishing him a happy birthday. Virgil continues the operation on his own, but, without the influence of Daric or Ben, is soon discovered thanks to his own carelessness and bragging. Han is forced to take the blame for the cheat sheet operation and is suspended, but not before he proceeds to beat up Virgil. Ben begins to rebuild his life, studying hard again and engaging in volunteer activities once more. He also begins to spend more time with Stephanie, who reveals a wild side of her own when she gives him a CD [Music You Hump To] that she shoplifted. Ben gathers up the courage to ask Stephanie to the formal, to which she agrees. The four leave to Las Vegas for the Academic Decathlon championships. Daric hires a prostitute and the group proceeds to have sex with her, with Ben being the first. During his turn, Virgil pulls a gun on the prostitute and she storms off. Han berates him, but Virgil pulls the gun on him, resulting in Han angrily storming off. Despite the turmoil, the team wins the competition. Ben and Stephanie attend the winter formal together and continue to get to know each other. During the formal, the two share a dance. The situation is made clear to Ben when Steve is seen outside of the formal, waiting to take Stephanie home. Steve meets Ben at the basketball court and tells him that he has information on a possible score. Though Ben is reluctant to re-enter his previous activities, he gathers up the group once more and meets Steve at his home. The group is stunned when they are informed that Steve wants them to rob his parents' house. He refers to it as a wake-up call. Ben and Han are against the plan, but Daric convinces them to participate, saying that this would be the perfect opportunity to give Steve his wake-up call. They agree Steve’s plan and practice constantly. They also agree to purchase Steve a gun. On New Year's Eve, the four meet Steve at Jesus' house. With Ben acting as lookout, Han, Daric and Virgil begin attacking Steve. The lights go out as Virgil’s gun slips away from him. Steve lunges for the weapon and the struggle for the automatic results in it going off. Ben hears the shot and rushes into the garage. Ben beats Steve nearly to death, stopping only when Han yells to him. The four are stunned at what they just did and get Jesus to agree to allow them to bury the body in his backyard for $300. Steve begins to twitch. Daric soaks a rag in gasoline and, with a tearful Virgil holding him, suffocates Steve with it. Afterwards, the four go to a New Year's party, where they each split up. Ben and Stephanie kiss at midnight, to which Stephanie tells an apologetic Ben that it is okay. The cell phone ring tone came from Steve's phone, which shows that the missed call was from Stephanie. Ben debates about whether or not to report Steve's murder to the police. The knowledge of his role in the murder is too much for Virgil, who attempts to commit suicide after calling over Han under the premise of watching some pornography. He survived the gunshot wound, but will most likely suffer brain damage. Daric arrives shortly after Ben, makes a flippant remark that angers Han and Ben escorts him out of the room. Daric expresses concern about the possibility of Han or Virgil revealing their secret. Ben simply resolves to do nothing and leaves Daric alone. With the group now permanently separated, Ben is alone at school. He goes to the basketball court but is unable to attempt a shot. On his way home, Stephanie pulls over in her new car and picks him up. She asks him whether he has seen Steve lately, and expresses some concern that he has not called. They kiss, implying she and Ben will continue their relationship. As they drive off, Ben's voice over tells the audience that he has no idea what is going to happen or what the other guys will do but all he knows is that there is no turning back."] ['{{plot}} The film is told through the perspective of Scott "Scotty" Smalls , who is reminiscing about the summer of 1962. Smalls moves with his mother  and stepfather Bill  to a new neighborhood outside Los Angeles. One afternoon, he decides to follow a group of neighborhood boys, and he watches them play a game at a small field, which they call the "Sandlot." Smalls is reluctant to join their game because he fears he will be ridiculed based on his inexperience. Nevertheless, he chooses to play with them, but fails to catch a simple fly ball and properly throw the ball back to his infielders. All the other players, except for Benny Rodriguez , begin to laugh at Smalls for committing defensive miscues, prompting him to leave the sandlot in embarrassment. Benny, who is the best player in the neighborhood, shields Smalls from the insults of his peers and invites him to rejoin their game. He proceeds to give Smalls advice and helps him earn the respect of the other players. As Smalls continues to play with them, he begins to learn many of the customs of the sandlot, while experiencing many misadventures with his new friends. He learns that players avoid hitting home runs over the sandlot\'s fences, as the property beyond them is guarded by a massive and ferocious dog, a 300-pound English mastiff called "The Beast." The team has several misadventures, including a trip to the pool, where Squints, who can\'t swim, deliberately jumps off at the deep end, to get his lifeguard crush Wendy Peffercorn to rescue him, and he kisses her during mouth to mouth, which although it results in a permanent ban from the pool, it cements Squints and Wendy\'s relationship. Later, the team plays a night game on the Fourth of July, although everyone except Benny is more interested in watching the fireworks than playing. Then the team accepts a challenge from a snooty rival team, whom the Sandlot kids easily defeat. Later, they experiment with chewing tobacco at a carnival, then proceed to enjoy a fast ride until they all end up puking on everyone surrounding the ride. One day, the leather ruptures, causing the ball\'s entrails to come out. While the others are impressed about this, Benny feels guilty because the group does not have 98 cents to buy another baseball, and is forced to retire for the afternoon. However, Smalls runs to Bill\'s trophy room, and steals his stepfather\'s autographed ball, while his stepfather is away on a business trip, in hopes to preserve the game. The team is impressed with Smalls’ gesture, and allows him to have the first at bat with the ball. He proceeds to hit the ball out of the sandlot, but is shortly enveloped by fear once he realizes that he has lost Bill\'s ball. The situation is further worsened when Smalls realizes that the ball was autographed by Babe Ruth, and is almost irreplaceable, and the team rebukes him for his stupidity for playing with such a valuable ball. They quickly scrap up change to buy a new ball and forge Babe Ruth\'s signature on it to cover for the missing ball until they can think of something. Thinking that The Beast\'s owner will not give them the ball back, Smalls and his friends begin engineering elaborate plans to recover the ball from The Beast. After five failed rescue attempts, including, a stick, a pot on a metal rod, a vacuum cleaner, Yeah-yeah on a pulley, and a catapult composed of an Erector set, Smalls prepares to accept his fate. Around the same time, Benny has an enlightening dream, where he is visited by Babe Ruth, who encourages him to run into the Beast\'s domain, and use his speed to recover the ball and escape. Ruth leaves Benny with the words, "Heroes get remembered, but legends never die." Benny rallies his friends the following morning at the sandlot, and prepares to recover Smalls’ baseball. Using his PF Flyers , he steals the ball from the Beast, and successfully manages to elude the dog as it chases him through town. And the sandlot gang follow him. The Beast chases Benny through an alley, a movie theater, a carnival, and back to the sandlot. Benny starts to slow down and the beast starts to catch up to him. Benny returns to Mr.Mertle\'s home and hops the fence. The race ends with the fence collapsing on the Beast. Smalls feels responsible for the ordeal, and helps The Beast escape the rubble. After being rescued, The Beast, whose real name is Hercules, becomes much more friendly and affectionate towards the boys, even showing them where he had buried all the baseballs that had gone into the yard over the years. Benny and Smalls then decide to tell the dog\'s owner, Mr. Mertle , about the ordeal, and reveals he would have given them the ball back if they had just asked him. The rest of the boys are upset at Squints for making up the story of Mertle being \'the meanest old man that ever lived\' and blame him for it. Benny and Smalls eventually learn that Mr. Mertle was a professional baseball player in the Negro League and was a friend of Babe Ruth himself. Mr. Mertle, whose career ended after a hit by a stray pitch blinded him, agrees to give Smalls a ball signed by Murderers\' Row&nbsp;– several of the best Yankee hitters in the late 1920s . In exchange, the boys are to visit Mr. Mertle once a week to talk baseball with him. Smalls proceeds to give his stepfather the ball that Mr. Mertle gave him. While Bill is pleased with the Murderers\' Row ball, he is still upset about the Babe Ruth ball, but he only grounds Smalls for a week. Smalls goes on to explain what became of all his friends. Yeah Yeah\'s parents sent him off to military school, after the army he became one of the pioneer developers of bungie jumping . Ham became a professional wrestler called "The Great Hambino". Timmy and Tommy became architects and invented mini malls. Squints married Wendy Peffercorn, had nine kids, and bought Vincent\'s Drug Store. Bertrum got "really into the sixties", and no one ever saw him again. DeNunez played Triple A ball, now owns a business, and coaches a little league team that his sons play on, called "The Heaters", which is name after a trademark pitch of his. And Hercules lived to be 199 years old in dog years. The film then jumps 30 years into the future, where Smalls is a radio sports commentator for the Los Angeles Dodgers  and owns the fake Babe Ruth ball, the chewed up real one, and the Murderer\'s Row ball, given to him by his friends, Mr. Mertle, and his stepdad. Benny "The Jet" Rodriguez is one of the team\'s star players, wearing #3. While he is in the twilight of his career, Benny manages to steal home in the movie\'s final moments, then flashes a thumbs-up to Smalls in the press box. With the game over, Smalls then stares at a group photo on his wall of him and his friends back in 1962.'] ["Alice McKinley  is an 11-year-old girl who is facing many challenges.

After Tre gets involved in a fight at school, his teacher calls Reva. The teacher informs Reva that although Tre is rather intelligent, he is immature and lacks respect for classmates and adults alike. Frightened about the future of her child, Reva sends him to live in the Crenshaw neighborhood of South Central Los Angeles with his 27-year-old father, Furious Styles , from whom she hopes Tre will learn life lessons. On the night of Tre\'s arrival, he hears his father firing at a burglar. LAPD officers arrive more than an hour later, and eventually decide the crime is unimportant because nothing was taken and the burglar escaped completely unharmed. The police, particularly the African American officer, treat Furious with disrespect and contempt. The following day, Tre reunites with childhood friends Darrin "Doughboy" Baker, his maternal half-brother Ricky, and Chris. Doughboy and Ricky live with their mother across the street from Furious. While Ricky is naïve and trusting, Doughboy is aggressive and street-smart. He soon gets into a fight to retrieve Ricky\'s stolen football, but is beaten up. The ball is returned to him later by a Crips gang member. Furious, who appears to be the only father present in the neighborhood, takes Tre on a fishing trip, where they talk, and he asks him about sexual nature and discusses the responsibility of fatherhood to him. The pair return to Crenshaw, where they notice Doughboy and Chris being led by police officers into a squad car after having been caught stealing in the local shop. Seven years later, in 1991, a "welcome home" party is being held in the Baker home. Doughboy , who had previously dropped out of high school, has just been released from prison, and sits at a table playing dominoes with Chris , now in a wheelchair, "Dookie" , and "Monster". Ricky , now a star running-back for Crenshaw High School, lives at home with his mother Brenda , girlfriend Shanice , and his newborn son. After the party is over, Tre walks home with leftovers for his father. As he walks along the street, Tre notices another one of the numerous babies belonging to drug-addict Cheryl walking dangerously on the street. He hurries to pick her up and brings her back to Sheryl, angrily reminding her to "keep the babies off the streets". Continuing on the way home, Tre encounters a group of Bloods gang members, who threateningly tease Tre by pointing a double-barreled shotgun at him. When Tre gets home, he gets a haircut from his 34-year-old father, telling him about his first failed attempt to have sex. Tre\'s father seems amused at first, but then sternly asks if Tre used a condom, for he was afraid of becoming a grandfather. Life goes on in the hood, with scenes including Tre flirting with Brandi and a drug-addict getting beat up by Doughboy and the gang after stealing Dookie\'s necklace. One night, a man from the USC comes to interview Ricky about college, with Ricky\'s rude friends giving him a bad impression. Ricky hopes to earn a scholarship to USC, but is daunted by the requirement that he must earn a 700 on his SAT to pass.In 1991, possible SAT scores ranged from 400 to 1600. With the addition of the Writing section in 2005, scores now range from 600 to 2400. Meanwhile, Furious has managed to secure Tre , who now holds a steady job and excels at school. He hopes to attend college with his girlfriend, Brandi , whose desire to remain abstinent is a source of tension between them. One night, during a local street racing gathering, Ricky is provoked by Ferris , a Bloods member. In defense of Ricky, Doughboy brandishes his .45 ACP handgun. Ferris fires his MAC-10 into the air, causing everyone to speed away from the scene. Tre and Ricky are pulled over by an LAPD patrol; the lead officer turns out to be the same one who responded to Furious\' 9-1-1 burglary call years ago. The officer shoves a gun in Tre\'s face and taunts him, asking what he will do about it. On the verge of tears, Tre arrives late to Brandi\'s house and suffers a mental breakdown; later that night, they have sex for the first time. The next day, Ricky, annoyed by his girlfriend, has a fight with Doughboy. Brenda rushes to Ricky\'s aid while berating Doughboy. This incident made Doughboy even more angry and he asks furiously, "What you hit me for!?" Ricky and Tre later head to the grocery store, but encounter Ferris and the Bloods. They cut though back alleys and separate to avoid them, but the Bloods show up, and Ricky is shot once in the leg and once in the back, killing him. The Bloods then depart from the scene. Doughboy and his friends recover Ricky\'s body, with a hysterical Brenda blaming Doughboy, who unsuccessfully tries to comfort her. Later that night, Brenda sobs over Ricky\'s test results, discovering he earned a 710 &mdash; just enough to qualify for a USC scholarship. Doughboy, Dookie, Monster, and Tre vow revenge on the Bloods. Furious finds Tre holding his .357 Magnum pistol and seemingly convinces him to abandon his plans. However, Tre sneaks out of his bedroom window to join Doughboy and the Crips. Later that night, as the gang drives around the city, Tre realizes he is making a mistake and asks to be let out of the car. Doughboy pulls over and lets Tre out at a bus stop. Doughboy finds the Bloods eating at a fast-food restaurant, upon whom Monster opens fire with a Type 56 assault rifle in a drive-by shooting. Despite both Monster and Dookie\'s pleas to flee the scene, Doughboy gets out of his car and personally finishes Ferris and the other wounded gang member, avenging Ricky\'s death. Meanwhile, Tre returns home to which he finds his waiting father. Furious and Tre silently exchange glances for a moment, and then Furious enters his own room and slams the door. The next morning, Doughboy visits Tre, now understanding Tre\'s reasons for abandoning the gang. Doughboy &mdash; having killed two men &mdash; knows that he will soon face retaliation for Ferris\' death, and accepts the consequences of his crime-ridden life. He plaintively questions why America "don\'t know, don\'t show, or don\'t care about what\'s going on in the Hood." He sorrowfully says that he has no brothers left now after Ricky\'s death, but is embraced by Tre, who says Doughboy still has "one brother left." Doughboy then walks away, pouring out his malt liquor simultaneously. In the epiloque, it is shown that Doughboy was murdered two weeks later, and Tre and Brandi managed to attend Morehouse and Spelman in Atlanta, respectively.'] ['Anne Marie , Eden , and Lena  are best friends.

While Penny is at school, Anne Marie, Eden, and Lena work as maids at a large resort hotel, but more importantly, they are surfers. Anne Marie rises every morning before dawn to train for her surfing comeback. She was once considered a rising star in women\'s surfing and competed as a youth, but a bad wipeout and near-drowning incident temporarily halted her career and left her with deep-seated fears. Her friends, especially Eden, have encouraged her to try it again. Anne Marie has been invited to join in an upcoming surf competition at the famed North Shore surf spot, Pipeline. She hopes to gain the attention of sponsors and get herself and her friends out of the near-poverty they are living in. As the Pipeline competition gets closer, Anne Marie struggles to keep Penny under control and deal with her own personal issues. At work, Anne Marie meets and catches the eye of Matt Tollman , a National Football League quarterback in Hawaii for the Pro Bowl . Matt is there with several of his rowdy teammates and instantly becomes attracted to the surfer. Through a series of "chance" encounters, she agrees to teach him how to surf, bringing Lena, Eden, and Penny along for the ride. Her acceptance of a non-local begins to cause friction between her and many of the young men in her surfing social circle. Anne Marie faces more problems when she and Eden argue about Anne Marie\'s lack of dedication to training for the Pipeline contest due to the sudden appearance of Matt. She also has to hear vicious comments from several of the other football players\' wives and girlfriends staying at the hotel about how she is undergoing the "Matt Tollman makeover" while attending a luau at the resort. Anne Marie confronts Matt about their situation, and soon resolves to step up her game as she finally commits herself to the Pipeline Masters. On the day of Pipeline, Anne Marie wipes out during her first heat, but advances to the next heat after narrowly beating pro surfer Kate Skarratt. She is shaken, but Matt tells her a story about his first game as a quarterback and helps her regain her wavering confidence. Determined, but still afraid, Anne Marie returns to the water. Competing in the same heat is Keala Kennelly, one of the first professional female surfers, playing herself. While Keala surfs the first few sets of waves without wipe-outs, Anne Marie still has inhibitions about riding one, visions of another near-drowning incident holding her back. Keala finishes her turn, then paddles out and takes Anne Marie under her wing and encourages her to take the best wave of the day, on which Anne Marie manages to score perfectly. Although she does not advance to the next heat, she has regained her lost confidence, but more importantly, attracted the notice of sponsors, one of which includes an offer to join the Billabong women\'s surf team.'] ['The film is narrated by an author, Gordie Lachance .

Matilda gave them gifts and gold coins when they lost a tooth, thus earning her the name "Tooth Fairy." After a fire in her home left her horribly disfigured with an extreme sensitivity to light, she wore a porcelain mask, and only went out at night. Although the children adored Matilda, the adults were suspicious of her and one day, when two children went missing, the townspeople quickly blamed Matilda and hanged her, ripping off her porcelain mask and exposing her face to the light. Out of anger and betrayal, Matilda promised her vengeance. Soon afterward, the two missing children returned home unharmed.

After a visit to the hospital to talk to Michael - with his bag of flashlights, his "peace of mind" - Kyle soon realizes that Michael has had an encounter with the Tooth Fairy. Michael, like Kyle, now has a gripping fear of the dark, and is thought to have gone insane. Afraid of the truth, Kyle at first denies any relation to his condition, and walks away from Caitlin. United with his childhood neighbors, Kyle attempts to warn others of the Tooth Fairy and tells them to stay in the light. The ridicule that he faces leads to the death of many townspeople.

After convincing the police that his story is true, Kyle, Michael and Caitlin decide to lead the Tooth Fairy to the largest source of light in the town - the lighthouse. They are assisted by several medical personnel, all of whom are killed by the Tooth Fairy on the way. In an attempt to destroy her, Kyle truly faces the demon as he rips off her porcelain mask and ignites her.

Izzy is raising her younger brother, Kevin, by herself. Their parents are deceased and her older brother, Rusty, is away in the Marines. When Izzy learns that her little brother is being bullied at school, she does what any unstable, psychopathic, homicidal sister would do.Sick Girl The movie starts out with Izzy waiting for the school bus. In the back are two popular girls who make several snide remarks about her. One of the girl's boyfriend is following the bus route in his car with his friend. The girls drop a pair of panties out the window, and if her boyfriend finds them, he'll be rewarded. After Izzy attacks one of the nuns on the bus for seemingly no reason, she's kicked off and begins to walk back along the road. She runs into the two boys, and lures the friend out of the car. She kills him, and the other boy quickly discovers the scene. Izzy chases him across a field and tackles him. The scene ends, and now we see Izzy cleaning herself up in a bathroom. She is covered in blood and is completely unfazed by this. Clips are shown of Izzy finding a gun in the boys' car, and her holding the school bus hostage, seemingly killing everyone. She chases the two popular girls off the bus, and with the gun and a can of gasoline, she quickly catches one of the girls. The other watches in horror as Izzy kills her friend. Izzy returns home, and we see a flashback sequence of Rusty training Izzy how to fight in their garage. The two share a moment of sibling fondness, but it is cut short by the arrival of Rusty's girlfriend. The flashback sequence ends, and Izzy finds their family friend, Barnie, teaching Kevin how to throw a punch. Izzy soon learns the motives behind the lesson: Barn saw some school bullies hassling Kevin after school. Izzy decides she'll try to help defend her brother, but Kevin brushes her off, saying he can handle it himself. He then asks why Rusty hasn't called, pointing out that another kid's father is stationed where Rusty is, and he calls all the time. Izzy gets really mad and screams at Kevin, saying that Rusty is the greatest Marine to ever live. Kevin is shocked by her reaction, but quickly recovers. With another flashback, we see Rusty informing Izzy he's joining the Marines, leaving her to watch Kevin. Izzy kisses him, and Rusty walks away, shocked. Back in present times, she opens the trunk of the car she stole from the two boys. In the back are the boyfriend and the other school girl. Both are bound and gagged , but the boy looks unconscious or dead. The girl begs for release, but Izzy only taunts her, showing no remorse. Kevin and Barn talk in a restaurant, and Kevin reveals that his teacher's rat, Edward, has gone missing. The teacher asks his students to please return the rat, no questions asked. After school, Tommy—the bully—and his two minions corner Kevin. They have been starving Edward, and plan on letting Edward feed on Kevin—whether their motives are real or not is interrupted by Izzy. The three bullies run off, and Izzy promises to take Edward back to the teacher. Kevin thanks her, and hurries off to his ride home with Barn. Izzy does not return the rat, but goes to the teacher anyway. There, she threatens him, saying that he better take better care of Kevin than he did the rat. As one of Tommy's friends is walking home, Izzy drives up along side him and begins to question him. It is revealed that Tommy is in the trunk of the car, and Izzy kidnaps Rudi after her interrogation. The other friend, Corey, is kidnapped by Izzy from his house, and the three are taken to the shore of a nearby lake. She torments Tommy, saying that he'll only beat up those who are weaker than he is, which is only okay if you also take on things bigger than you. That being said, Tommy drowns Rudi in the lake after Izzy's encouragement. After Rudi dies, Tommy is then told to kill Corey by slitting his throat. Corey protests, and Tommy stabs him in the back. Izzy is holding her three hostages—the school girl and her boyfriend, and Tommy—in the barn, as well as Edward the rat. After toying with them a little, Izzy puts a sack over Tommy’s head, knocks him out with a shovel, and lets Edward feast on him. Later, she leaves Edward on the teacher’s porch. Because Kevin has a passion for Bonsai trees, Izzy breaks several of Tommy’s limbs with a hammer, and using Christmas lights, ties him up in a gruesome fashion. Kevin, Barnie, and Izzy open their Christmas presents. Kevin opens a package from Izzy and finds the gun that she had stolen from the two boys. Barnie thinks it’s fake, but Izzy tells him it’s real. Barnie questions her motives, angry that she’d give a young kid such a gift. On the evening news, Izzy discovers that the police think that the boyfriend, Michael, along with the other schoolgirl, were involved in the ‘school bus massacre’, and the disappearance of the school bullies. The police disclose information about the last sightings of them, which includes a description of Michael’s car. Izzy burns it, and as she walks back along the road, and a guy driving by gives her a lift. Izzy remains wary of him, but he doesn’t try to harm her. The subject of family comes up, and Izzy tells him she’s already married—to a Marine—and has one child, but wants another one when her husband returns from the war. Back at home, Izzy is tormented by a flashback of Rusty just before he left kissing his girlfriend goodbye. The flashback enrages her, and she quickly goes to the girlfriend’s house and suffocates her. The following morning, Izzy goes to the barn to her two remaining hostages. She cuts off the penis of Michael, and puts together a makeshift strap-on with a large spike attached to a piece of wood. Meanwhile, Barnie and Kevin return home from grocery shopping. As Izzy begins to rape Stephanie with the strap-on, Barnie enters the barn, and is shocked to find Izzy’s sick experiments. She impales him with an axe, and as Barnie falls to the ground, Kevin is revealed standing behind him, and he too sees the torture. He runs inside the house, and Izzy follows him. She tries to calm him, but he takes the gun and shoots himself in the head before her eyes. She becomes hysterical, and burns down the barn. In a flashback to an undetermined previous time, two Marines go to her house. Although there is no sound in this scene, it’s obvious they are there to tell her that Rusty died in the war. She lashes out at them, and the movie ends."] ["Melissa Morris  desperately tries to gain more attention from her always preoccupied father, Neil, a best-selling author .

The label, headed by the trendy and scheming Fiona, pumps out pop bands and, through an arrangement with the United States government, get teens to buy their records and follow "a new trend every week" by putting subliminal messages under the music. The Government\'s motive in the scheme is to help build a robust economy from the "wads of cash" teenagers earn from babysitting and minimum wage jobs. When a member of Wyatt\'s wildly successful boy band, Du Jour, uncovers one such message and asks Wyatt about it aboard their private jet, Wyatt parachutes out with the pilot, leaving the plane to crash and apparently killing Du Jour. Wyatt lands just outside the town of Riverdale, and bumps into an unappreciated rock band — the Pussycats, made up of three working class young ladies: vocalist/guitarist Josie McCoy, drummer Melody Valentine, and bassist/backup vocalist Valerie Brown. As the Pussycats are struggling financially, they accept Wyatt\'s offer to a lucrative record deal despite its implausibility. They are flown to New York City where they are renamed "Josie and the Pussycats", much to the girls\' discomfort. All goes well and their first single climbs rapidly to the top of the charts, but Valerie grows increasingly frustrated that all media attention is focused on Josie  rather than the band as a whole. Melody, too simple to notice the undue attention Josie receives, uses her uncanny behavioral perception and becomes suspicious of Fiona and Wyatt. Due to Valerie and Melody\'s suspicions, Fiona orders Wyatt to kill them; he attempts to do so by sending them without Josie on a fake "appearance" on a badly faked set for the MTV show Total Request Live, in which an obviously fake Carson Daly impersonator and the real Carson Daly assault them with baseball bats . Meanwhile, Josie plans to attend a gig at a bar by Alan M, a fellow musician and Josie\'s childhood sweetheart, but Wyatt deceives her by telling her it was canceled. Instead, Josie listens to a new remix of their latest single, and is brainwashed by subliminal messages into desiring a solo career and seeing Valerie and Melody as impediments. After an argument with her bandmates, Josie realizes that the music influenced the fight. Her suspicions are confirmed when she uses a mixing board to make the subliminal track audible, but she is caught by Fiona. MegaRecords have organized a giant pay-per-view concert, whereby they plan to unleash their biggest subliminal message scheme yet. They force Josie to perform on stage by threatening to kill Melody and Valerie. The badly injured members of Du Jour  appear just in time to stop Wyatt and Fiona from completing their scheme. In the resulting fight, Josie destroys the machine used to make the messages. The message for the concert is revealed not to promote the band, the label, or a corporate sponsor, but to make Fiona popular. Fiona suffers a breakdown and reveals that she had been an outcast in high school who spoke with a lisp. Wyatt reveals that his appearance is a disguise — that he went to the same high school as Fiona, but was a persecuted and unpopular albino nicknamed "White-Ass Wally". Fiona and Wyatt fall in love. The government agents  arrive; because the conspiracy is exposed, and the government has decided that movies provide a better channel for subliminal messages , the agents arrest Fiona and Wyatt as scapegoats to cover-up the government\'s involvement in the failed scheme. Josie, Valerie and Melody then proceed to perform the concert, and for the first time their fans are able to judge the band on its merits rather than be subliminally persuaded to like the band. Alan M comes to the concert and confess his love for Josie on stage, and she returns his feelings. The audience roars their approval as the film comes to a close.'] ['{{plot}} The place is Helverton, Colorado.

Upon "meeting" another apparent student who goes by the screen name of "Captain Howdy," Genevieve and Tiana decide to attend a party at Captain Howdy\'s house.

The case takes an unexpected turn when Tiana\'s car is pulled out of a lake. Tiana\'s tortured body is found in the car\'s trunk with her mouth stitched shut, and there is no sign of Genevieve. Mike discovers that Captain Howdy is into "body art" that includes great quantities of tattooing, piercing, branding, and scarification. But it is not until Mike\'s niece Angela Stravelli  informs him of Genevieve\'s penchant for meeting strangers through the Internet that Mike gets his first lead. Meeting the mysterious Captain Howdy online, Mike gets Captain Howdy to invite him to a party, but Mike\'s planned bust goes awry. Later, however, he figures out Captain Howdy\'s location, and finds Captain Howdy\'s torture chamber. Gage not only finds Genevieve naked and bound, with her mouth stitched shut, but also five other teenagers who are in similar predicaments. After a brief struggle in which Captain Howdy gets shot, Mike arrests him, whose real name is Carlton Hendricks . Mike thinks he has closed the case. But a year later, Hendricks is declared not guilty by reason of insanity and he is put in the Meistrich Psychiatric Institute. Three years later, Hendricks is released. Doctors at the Meistrich Institute state that Hendricks, who has been diagnosed as a schizophrenic with a severe chemical imbalance, is okay as long as he is on his medication. Hendricks moves back to his old neighborhood. While he\'s under the influence of his medicine, Hendricks is timid and apologetic about what he did. But, the memories of what Hendricks did are still fresh in the minds of Helverton\'s residents. There are people who are not happy about Hendricks release—especially an activist group led by Jackson Roth  and Catherine "Sunny" Macintosh . One night while Roth\'s teenage daughter Kelly  is out, a fearful Roth jumps to the wrong conclusion that Hendricks could have taken Kelly. Roth calls Catherine and a bunch of others. Roth and his group kidnap Hendricks, and on the way from Hendricks\'s property, Hendricks accidentally drops his medicine bottle, and the medicine bottle is run over by a car\'s rear tire. Roth and the group beat Hendricks and hang him from a tree. As Roth, Catherine, and the others leave, it starts raining. The rope, which turns out to be weak, snaps, saving Hendricks life. Without his medication, however, he reverts to being Captain Howdy, this time with revenge on his mind...revenge on Roth, Catherine, and Mike. Later, Hendricks kills Madeline in front of Roth. Hendricks knocks Roth unconscious and kidnaps him. Hendricks contacts Mike at the police station. By this time, Hendricks has also kidnapped Catherine. After Hendricks hangs up with Mike, Hendricks brutally tortures Roth and Catherine. The next day, Toni calls Mike and tells him that Genevieve is missing, and when Mike gets home with Steve, Hendricks\'s face is on Toni\'s computer screen. Hendricks has Genevieve and her mouth is stitched shut again. Hendricks tortures Genevieve while Mike and Toni watch the screen. After Hendricks disconnects, Genevieve, Roth, and Catherine are soon found alive, but brutally tortured. That night, Mike tracks Hendricks to a church. After a long struggle, Hendricks stands ready to kill Mike with a hook. Mike sinks the hook into Hendricks\'s back, slams Hendricks into a wall, and then uses the hook to lift Hendricks off the floor. Mike pours a flammable liquid on Hendricks, and presumably kills Hendricks by setting him on fire.'] ['When Adrien is released from an mental institution, her former doctor, Henry Thompson immediately tries to get her back on her feet by getting her a job at a country club on the East Coast, where she is introduced to the lifestyle of the snooty, rich "beautiful people".

In the dream world, Jason realizes he was tricked by Freddy and a battle ensues between the two. While Freddy is unable to kill Jason at first, he soon discovers Jason\'s fear of water and exploits this weakness, turning Jason into a child and then bringing him into a nightmare of his childhood. Lori comes up with the idea to drive unconscious Jason back to Crystal Lake, while she goes into the dream world to find Freddy and pull him into the real world and pit the two against each other, hoping Jason will win because he\'ll be re-energised by being back at "home". Furthermore if Jason kills Freddy, he will be at Crystal Lake and will not come after the group when he\'s finished. In the dream, Lori sees Freddy attempting to drown Jason and unwillingly wakes Jason up, who attacks the group, who have now arrived at Crystal Lake. Freddy, enraged, brings Lori into a nightmare, which reveals that he was the one who killed her mother, before attempting to kill Lori. After nearly getting molested by Freddy, Lori awakens and drags him in the waking world after her arm gets burned. Jason attacks Freddy, who is somewhat paralyzed by his ironic fear of fire, and throws him through the burning cabin\'s roof. Lori, Will, Kia and Linderman try to escape, but Linderman is wounded and dies soon afterwards. Kia tries to save Lori and Will from Freddy by taunting him about Jason being superior over him, but she is brutally killed by Jason, who was behind her. Freddy and Jason continue their battle and Lori decides to stay until she is assured of Freddy\'s death. While Freddy is no match for Jason\'s physical power, he\'s still able to wound Jason because of his dominant speed and agility, even gaining possession of Jason\'s machete. During their fight, Lori and Will burn the propane gas tanks at the docks to blow both Freddy and Jason up. When the fire starts to spread, Jason rips off Freddy\'s clawed arm and Freddy drives the machete into Jason\'s chest. Lori and Will dive under the dock as the gas tanks start burning and seconds later, they explode, sending Freddy and Jason into the lake. Freddy comes back and attempts to kill Lori with Jason\'s machete, but before he can, Jason attacks from behind, stabbing Freddy with his own clawed glove before falling into Crystal Lake; though it is not made clear as to whether he did so to continue fighting Freddy or to help Lori since she saved him earlier. Fatally wounded, Freddy drops the machete and kneels at the dock helplessly. Lori picks up the machete, then beheads Freddy and throws the machete into the lake as Jason gives her a respectful looking gaze and sinks into Crystal Lake. Lori and Will depart, but the next morning Jason rises from the water, alive and carrying his machete and Freddy\'s severed head, appearing to be the victor. However, Freddy\'s head then winks at the audience and his laugh can be heard as the screen cuts to black.'] ['Wassup Rockers is about a group of Guatemalan American and Salvadoran American teenagers in South Los Angeles who, instead of conforming to the hip hop culture of their gang-infested neighborhood, wear tight pants, listen to punk rock, and ride skateboards.

After T.P. finishes his story, Max begins to tell of a man named Madman Marz, who killed his whole family with an axe, and was convicted, hit in the face with an axe, and hung for his crimes, only to break free of the noose and disappear into the woods. Max continues by saying that anyone who says his name above a whisper will awaken him and cause him to come back and kill that person. At that, Richie, a cocky teenager, stands up and screams Madman Marz, throwing a rock into his old house, smashing a window. Max, annoyed at Richie, ends the campfire, sending everyone to their cabins for the night, while he goes into town to retrieve supplies to help tear down the camp, since it was to end the next day. While they go back to the cabins, Richie sees Madman Marz up in a tree, and goes to see if it's really him. Everyone else gets back to camp, and Max and Dave try to retrieve the axe they had used to cut wood out of a log, but it is stuck. The cook, Dippy, comes out, and wishes them all a good night, before Marz comes in and rips his throat out, and rips the axe out of the log. T.P. tries to get Betsy to go out with him, but she refuses, causing a scene. After the kids have gone to sleep, the rest of the counselors see Max off and go into the rec room to relax. T.P apologizes for being rude to Betsy and she goes with him to have sex in the hot tub, all the while being watched by Madman Marz. After this, Dave is called out to Richie's cabin, and the boys there tell him that Richie never came back, so he goes and informs the others, who are all rejoined up with each other. T.P decides to go and find him, and sets off into the woods, carrying a flashlight. He comes across an opening and calls for Richie, who is busy wandering around the woods looking for Marz. All of a sudden, a noose falls over T.P's neck and lifts him up into the air on a tree branch. He grabs it and pulls himself up, only to have Marz grab his leg and pull him back down, snapping his neck on impact. Back at the camp, Betsy and Stacy begin to talk about T.P. Stacy believes that T.P only wants sex, and apologized because he knew he would get some, but Betsy thinks he's a nice guy who really likes her. Realizing that it has been a long time since T.P. left has passed, Dave decides to go find T.P and Richie. Dave ventures out into the woods and comes across T.P's hanging body. Panicked, he runs farther into the woods. Marz is behind him with the axe and begins to chase him. Dave finally falls over a fallen tree branch and is decapitated by Marz with the axe. Betsy wants to talk to T.P, but finds out that he's still gone and begins to worry. Richie, meanwhile, is still out in the woods, but is now looking for the road back to camp, or someone to take him back. Stacy decides to take the car down to see where everybody is, suspecting that T.P's playing a trick on them. So she gets into her car and drives out on the road, towards the woods by the campfire spot, and Marz's house, where we see him run out of. Stacy begins to look around for Dave, T.P, and Richie, but finds nothing, except an abandoned flashlight in the clearing where the two were killed, only T.P's body is now missing. Stacy begins to look around, and sees blood on the trees and starts to panic, running through the woods, until she spots Dave's head laying on the ground. She stifles her screams and rushes back to her car, and tries to drive away, only to have her engine stall, so she gets out and opens the hood, looking for the problem, when Marz jumps onto the car hood, smashing it down on Stacy, crushing her skull. Ellie and Bill have gone to have sex in the woods, leaving a worried Betsy back at camp. When she does not hear any word back, Betsy goes into the woods to find Ellie and Bill. Once she does, she tells them that she has to stay at camp to watch the kids and wait for the others to show up, and that Ellie and Bill should go and try to find them. Ellie and Bill get dressed and take Bill's car out to look for the others, while Betsy goes back to camp. While looking through the woods, Ellie sees Marz at Stacy's car, and begins to scream, making him run away and Bill come up to see what's wrong. She tells him that she saw a man there at Stacy's car, so both of them go up and decide to drive back to camp. The car will not start, and Bill gets out to see what's wrong, he sees Stacy's head on the engine. He gags, making Ellie curious enough to get out of the car and see, where she screams and has Bill knock it out with his flashlight. Then they get back in the car and hurriedly drive away, only reaching the end of the road, when Bill is pulled from the car window, causing the car to crash into a tree, and Ellie to fall out of the door and into a ditch. She looks up and watches in horror, as Bill has his back broken by Marz, and runs back to the camp. Betsy is in one of the girl's cabins and does not see Ellie come back and try to find her. Ellie then goes into the kitchen cabin and tries to find Betsy, but with no luck, she goes outside when Marz appears at the door, chasing her through the cabin until she hides in a refrigerator. Once she thinks he leaves, she climbs out and tries to leave, only to have him spring up and hit her with the axe. Betsy finally leaves the cabin and sees Marz running around the campgrounds, so she grabs a shotgun and quietly makes her way to the open-doored kitchen cabin, only to have Ellie pop up, causing her to shoot her friend in the face. Once she realizes that Ellie is dead, she runs and wakes up the kids, telling them to get into the bus they took to get there. They quickly do and she joins them, and begins to drive the bus away from camp, only to have Marz pop up at the door and try to get in. Betsy beats his hand with a metal baton, making him let go. Then she stops and has the oldest boy drive the rest to safety, while she goes to kill Marz and save her friends. So she gets out, and follows Marz to his house out in the woods. Once inside she tries not to make any noise, but makes a step creak, causing him to come at her in the darkness, where she shoots him with her rifle. He snatches it from her during a struggle, when he hits her in the face with his claw nails, ripping her face open. He then drags her towards the basement, while she tries to get away, but at the bottom, he shoves her up onto a coat hanger poker, but she pulls out a knife she had in her pocket, stabs him in the shoulder, causing him to knock over a candle. He presumably leaves after having knocked over the candle. While the candle begins to burn everything, we see all the people he had killed, including the skeletons of his wife and two children, T.P, Bill, Dave, Stacy, and now Betsy. The ending shows Max driving back to the camp and almost hitting a shaken Richie, who now says that Madman Marz is real."] ['"Everyone knows someone who\'s had a run-in with an angry racoon.

One day, a young student, Elizabeth, is studying in a classroom on the third floor, when without warning, she is attacked by unseen evil forces. One of St. Mark\'s priests, Father Drake, attempts to save Elizabeth from the apparently demonic aggressor, but he quickly proves to be powerless against it, and the girl vanishes without a trace. The school is immediately shut down, and all of the students are removed from campus by worried families. Five years later, the school reopens. A harsh headmistress, Miss Pearce, rules the girls with an iron fist; Father Drake remains at the school as a teacher, but because of the disappearance of Elizabeth he has become a drunkard, found by Miss Pearce at a bar. Five troubled and unwanted girls are left by their families at the school: Alex, Mara, Cecilia — who is blind, Leah, and Connie. The girls are strictly forbidden to go to the third floor . Cecilia and Mara enter the third floor, prompting Miss Pearce to punish the responsible party. Alex takes the blame and is severely beaten with a ruler. Alex begins to have visions of Elizabeth being possessed by a demon. Other strange things begin to happen, revealing that all five of the girls possess supernatural gifts. Connie is a "conduit," or a magnet for spirit activity, Leah can pass through objects , Cecilia has "second sight" or what the viewer could interpret as ESP, Mara can heal recent wounds , and Alex has telekinesis. It is revealed that Miss Pearce has brought the girls to the school for a very specific reason and is seen conjuring them to a pentagram on the third floor, after which Connie appears to be possessed. A possessed Connie then attempts to drown Leah and the demon passes into her while Connie falls dead. Leah/Legion  goes to confront Father Drake, revealing the name of the demon: Legion. They argue, Father Drake attempts to exorcise her, and Leah uses her new found demon powers to stab him with gold crucifixes. Alex, Mara, and Cecilia have been reading Elizabeth\'s journal  and have learned enough about Legion to know that they need to escape. They split up to search for the others, Mara finding Father Drake, Alex finding Connie, and Cecilia running into the demon. After a prolonged fight where Cecilia is severely bloodied and Leah\'s head is smashed in with a book, Legion moves on to Cecilia and grants her "first sight." Terrified, Mara and Alex try to flee, but Ms. Pearce locks them in and breaks Mara\'s healing hand. It is revealed that she is Elizabeth\'s sister, trying to save her from Legion. Mara and Alex then hole up in the bedroom and use Connie\'s spellbook to create a protective circle. Cecilia/Legion finds them and while cannot initially penetrate the circle, uses her own blood to cover over the lines and then possesses Mara. Miss Pearce is in another part of the building, chanting and Elizabeth\'s body slowly begins to appear before vanishing again. Mara is chasing Alex, who gets stabbed in the stomach. Miss Pearce begs Legion to let Elizabeth go, but they state that they only have 4 girls and the deal was for 5. Alex then uses her own powers of telekinesis to force Legion out of Mara and into Miss Pearce before ramming the demon\'s head through a crucifix. Mara and Alex collapse and presumably several hours later, Mara awakes and heals herself, but is unable to heal Alex in time. She begins to leave and encounters Virgil . Elizabeth comes running down the stairs, whole and alive, and greets him as father . He is happy and excited, until a bloody Miss Pearce grabs him by the throat and transfers Legion to him.

Despite his relative popularity at school, easy friendships with other players, and smart and sassy girlfriend Jules Harbor , Mox is dissatisfied with his life. He wants to leave Texas to go to school at Brown University. He disdains his football-obsessed father  and dreads playing it under legendary coach Bud Kilmer , a verbally abusive, controlling authority who believes in winning "at all costs". He has a strong track record as coach, remarking in a speech that "in my thirty years of coaching football at West Canaan, I have brought two state titles, and 22 district championships!" His philosophy finally takes its toll on Coyotes\' quarterback, Lance Harbor , Mox\'s best friend and brother of Mox\'s girlfriend. Lance is manipulated into taking anesthetic shots into an injured knee that finally succumbs to failure and results in even greater injury during gameplay. He is rushed to the hospital, where doctors are appalled at the massive amount of scar tissue found under his knee. Mox, who has accompanied Lance to the hospital, is shocked when Kilmer feigns ignorance to Lance\'s doctors about Lance\'s knee problems, when in fact Kilmer ordered the trainer to inject the shots. In need of a new quarterback, Kilmer reluctantly names Mox to replace Lance as captain and starting quarterback. The move brings unexpected dividends for Mox, one of them being Darcy Sears , Lance\'s beautiful blonde cheerleader girlfriend, who is interested in marrying a football player in order to escape small-town life. She even goes so far as to attempt to seduce Mox, sporting a "bikini" made of whipped cream over her otherwise naked body, but he rebuffs her as gently as he can. Disgusted with Kilmer and not feeling a strong need to win, Mox starts calling his own plays on the field without Kilmer\'s approval. He also chides his father, screaming at him, "I don\'t want your life!" The elder Moxon had been a football player at West Caanan, and although Kilmer dismissed him for lacking talent and courage, Moxon still respected and obeyed Kilmer. When Kilmer becomes aware that Mox has won a full scholarship to Brown, Kilmer threatens Mox that if he continues to disobey and disrespect him, the coach will alter Mox\'s transcripts in order to reverse the decision on his scholarship. Kilmer\'s lack of concern for players continues, resulting in a dramatic collapse of Billy Bob . When Wendell Brown, another friend of Mox\'s, is injured on the field, Kilmer pressures Brown to take a shot of cortisone to deaden the pain from his injury, allowing him to continue even in the face of a permanent injury. Desperate to be recruited by a good college, Wendell grants his consent. At this moment, Mox tells Kilmer he\'ll quit the team if the needle enters Wendell\'s knee. Undaunted, he orders Charlie Tweeder , a friend of both Mox and Wendell, to replace Mox, but Tweeder refuses. Mox tells Kilmer that the only way they will return to the field is without Kilmer. Realizing that he will be forced to forfeit the game, Kilmer loses control and attacks Mox. The other players intercede and then refuse to take to the field. Knowing his loss of control has cost him his credibility, Kilmer tries in vain to rally support and spark the team\'s spirit into trusting him, but none of the players follow him out of the locker room. He continues down the hall, and seeing no one following him, turns the other direction and into his office. The team goes on to win the game without his guidance. In a voice-over epilogue, Mox recounts several characters\' aftermaths, including the fact that Kilmer never coached again and that Lance became a successful coach.'] ['Chris Emerson , a young disgraced former surfing pro, and his younger sister Nicole  move to Luna Bay to live in a house owned by their Aunt Jillian ([[Gabrielle Rose  following the death of their parents.

Unfortunately, his parents find out the truth and as a result, Les is grounded. That night, having already made plans to use his new license, he sneaks out of the house with his grandfather\'s prized 1972 Cadillac for a night on the town with Mercedes. After showing him how the city looks from far away on a hill, she tells him that her father used to bring her there. While Mercedes is getting drunk, she and Les cause minor damage to the hood of the car by dancing on it. Mercedes then passes out. Les panics and goes to his friend Dean\'s house, where Dean  fixes the dents in the car\'s hood. Dean persuades Les to go out for a joyride, along with their friend Charles, who are both still unaware that Les does not have a license. The three, along with a blacked out Mercedes , end up getting into all kinds of trouble and hilarity ensues as they cause more damage to the Cadillac. Of course, the next day, Les does get in trouble with his father after coming back home  with a Cadillac that is damaged beyond minor repair. Then his mother, late in the night, wakes up her husband and shouts that she is in labor. Luckily, Les is able to drive his father, little brother Rudy and his mom to the hospital – in reverse, because the Cadillac is so badly damaged it can no longer be put into drive. After they get there and Les\' mother is taken into the hospital, a crane fails and a falling girder crushes the Cadillac, much to the shock of Les and his father. Later, thankfully, Les\' grandfather laughs it off when he jokingly reveals that he had written off Les\' father\'s BMW. Les\' father tells Les that the BMW is all his now, and, laughing, tells him to take good care of it. However, Les has changed his mind about getting a BMW, saying he does not need it anymore. Mercedes soon pulls up in a Volkswagen Golf Cabriolet, while Les says "I already have a Mercedes" and then runs over and hops into it. Les then drives off with Mercedes, and the credits roll.'] ['The film opens with 15-year-old Susan Bower on an alcohol and drug-fueled joyride with boyfriend Ricky and two other friends, which is intercut with scenes depicting testimony from teenage addicts in a drug rehabilitation program run by Dr. Royce. While foolishly attempting to drive with his eyes closed and both hands off the steering wheel, Ricky loses control of the car, causing it to skid on its side before overturning and landing all his passengers in the hospital . Once there, the presence of alcohol and drugs in Susan\'s bloodstream is revealed, much to the shock of her parents  and younger sister Kelly. After she is treated and released, Frank attempts to question Susan about what happened, and she tells him that while headed to the movies with a friend, they were picked up by two guys who gave them the alcohol and drugs that she consumed, supposedly not knowing the latter was actually methadrine, but emphasizes that she doesn\'t use drugs. Believing her apparent remorse to be sincere, Frank doesn\'t punish her, but later begins to doubt the validity of this story. Sure enough, Frank\'s suspicions are confirmed when a search of Susan\'s bedroom  uncovers her hidden "stash", which she claims to have been holding for a friend, when confronted about it. Not believing this story either, he promptly grounds Susan. Realizing their daughter is addicted, the Bowers later learn that Susan has been absent from school frequently for the past three months, and had been doctoring grades on the report cards she\'d shown them. A visit to a psychologist proves of little help, as he merely characterizes Susan\'s drug problem as natural adolescence rebellion, and blames Frank for being controlling and constraining, thus prompting her to rebel. Things finally come to a head when Susan runs away and is found by police two days later on the family\'s boat, getting high with Ricky and two other friends. The next day, Frank and Helen tell Susan that it would be better if she went to a private school in order to get away for a while. Upon arrival at the school, however, Susan discovers that it\'s really Dr. Royce\'s aforementioned drug treatment program, where she is placed under the supervision of a fellow addict who has gotten far enough in her program to be trusted. One key requirement of both addicts in the program and their families is attending twice-weekly meetings, in which they confess the full extent of their drug use and their families have the opportunity to confront them. At the first meeting they attend, Helen is shocked to hear the story of a girl who prostituted herself for drug money and demands that Frank pull Susan from the program. However, he refuses, insisting that this is a wake-up call for their daughter. Meanwhile, despite giving her testimony the following week , Susan remains hostile towards all efforts to get her to open up and share her feelings, and later runs away. Having no idea where his daughter might be, Frank finally receives a phone call from Ricky, who promises to turn her over to him in exchange for some liquid cocaine. Once there, Ricky attempts to play hardball, but Frank steadfastly refuses to hand over the drugs until he gets Susan back. Desperate for a fix, Ricky finally relents and leads Frank to his daughter; Susan is angry and refuses to go back to the center, but Frank assures her that he\'s going to take her home. Afterwards, Ricky tells Frank that he owes him something, to which Frank replies by telling him to have fun, and tosses the bag of drugs into a fire before Ricky can get his hands on it. However, rather than taking her home, Frank brings Susan back to the center, promising to do so as many times as it takes. Once she has returned, angry at Ricky\'s betrayal and realizing just what her life has come to, Susan finally breaks down and gradually begins opening up with the rest of the group. A subsequent parents only meeting also makes Frank finally realize that Susan\'s addiction wasn\'t his fault and that she\'s getting the help she needs, while Helen also has an awakening regarding the matter. During a closed-door senior staff meeting, Susan\'s recent progress is considered, but it is questioned if it is enough for her to go home, as she requested. The subsequent parent-child meeting shows Frank admitting his initial denial to his daughter, believing there was nothing he couldn\'t fix and that he thought other kids did drugs, but not his kid. Afterwards, Susan shares with him the good news that she is coming home, and as the residents, staff and parents cheer, she runs triumphantly into the arms of her waiting family.'] ['Abigail Louise "Abby" Jensen , who is eager to grow up, has been planning for her sweet 16 ever since she was a little girl.

While she is asleep she dreams about a little girl outside the house. When Kristen wakes up and goes to the bathroom she finds she is still asleep and encounters Freddy Krueger, who slashes her wrists with the razors on his glove. When Kristen awakes, she is holding a razor blade to her wrist. Her mother mistakes this incident as a suicide attempt and places Kristen in Westin Hills, a psychiatric hospital. Kristen meets the other patients of the hospital- Joey Crusel, who does not speak; Taryn White, an ex-drug addict; Roland Kincaid, a tough kid with behavioral problems; Phillip Anderson, a talented sculptor; Jennifer Caulfield, a wannabe actress; Will Stanton, who uses a wheelchair because of an earlier suicide attempt. They are the "last of the Elm Street children" – the remaining children of the vigilantes who killed Freddy. Kristen also meets Dr. Neil Gordon, a psychiatrist, and Nancy Thompson, the new staff research scientist. All of the kids are being tormented by Freddy in their dreams. If Freddy kills them in their dream, they die "for real." When Kristen has another terrifying dream where she is attacked by Freddy in the form of a giant snake, she reveals a latent ability to bring others into her dreams by bringing Nancy into the dream to assist her. Nancy sees the potential of Kristen\'s ability to defeat Freddy for good. Freddy kills two patients when they fall asleep. He slashes Phillip\'s feet and wrists and uses his tendons to walk him through the hospital like a marionette. He walks Philip to the top of the building and cuts the tendons, sending Phillip falling to his death as the other patients watch in horror. The next night, while Jennifer watches TV, the host of a talk show turns into Freddy and attacks the guest, Zsa Zsa Gabor. Jennifer walks over to the TV and smacks it. Two large mechanical arms explode out of the sides and pick her up. Freddy\'s head emerges from the TV and tells her "Welcome to Prime Time Bitch" before smashing her head into the screen. Meanwhile, Dr. Gordon receives visits from a mysterious nun, who introduces herself as Sister Mary Helena. She tells Dr. Gordon that Freddy Krueger was born in the abandoned wing of the same hospital, Westin Hills, after inmates gang-raped his mother, Amanda Krueger. Amanda Krueger was a staff member who was accidentally locked inside over the Christmas holidays. The nun also says that when he was killed, Freddy Krueger was never properly buried and must be laid to rest in consecrated ground. Nancy tells the kids during a group session that in their dreams they can be whomever, and possibly do whatever, they want. Nancy convinces Dr. Gordon to try an experimental hypnosis to put the kids and themselves into a deep sleep and have Kristen attempt to pull them into her dream. The attempt does not go well. Freddy, in the form of a hot nurse, lures Joey away and holds him captive in the dream world and renders him comatose in the real world. As a result, Dr. Carver fires Neil and Nancy from the hospital. Nancy goes to see her father, Lt. Donald Thompson. She makes an impassioned plea to him for help which ultimately falls on deaf ears. Neil tells her to go back to the hospital to help the kids while he forces Lt. Thompson to help him find Freddy\'s remains and bury them. The two men stop at a church to collect holy water and a crucifix. Back at the hospital, Nancy and the kids attempt a group sleep session to try to go in and free Joey and get to Kristen, who was thrown in the "quiet room" and sedated without her consent. As soon as the kids fall asleep, Freddy separates them. He kills Taryn by giving her a drug overdose, and he stabs Will in the stomach with his glove. Kincaid, who dreams of having super strength, manages to fight his way through Freddy\'s barriers and reunite with Nancy and Kristen. The three save Joey before Freddy can kill him. Kincaid attacks Freddy, but Freddy easily picks him up with one arm, which shocks Nancy. Krueger reveals he gains strength from imprisoning the souls of his victims inside him. Freddy is about to kill Kincaid when he senses that someone is messing with his corpse and disappears. Neil and Lt. Thompson have found Freddy\'s remains in a large auto salvage yard. They begin to dig a makeshift grave when the bones come to life. Lt. Thompson attempts to attack the Freddy-skeleton but the skeleton kills him by throwing him on a car fin. The skeleton then beats Neil with a shovel, leaving him unconscious near the makeshift grave. Still in the group sleep session, the remaining kids and Nancy proceed to make their way through Freddy\'s lair when they come to a room full of mirrors. Each of the party are grabbed and pulled through the walls by Freddy, except for Joey who lets out a piercing scream which shatters the mirrors, freeing them. Nancy notices a bright light from an adjoining room and realizes it is her father. Her father says his spirit has crossed over and wanted to say goodbye to her, and they embrace. Seconds later, Nancy is stabbed twice in the stomach by Freddy, who was disguised as her father. Believing his biggest threat has finally been removed, Freddy closes the door on Kincaid and Joey and proceeds to attack Kristen. Just as he is about to kill her, Nancy attacks from behind, making Krueger stab himself with the glove. At the same exact time, Neil awakens and sprinkles the holy water on Freddy\'s remains. He also uses the crucifix and completes the burial, causing Krueger to disappear in a brilliant white light. Nancy, grievously wounded, dies in Kristen\'s arms. At the Thompson\'s funeral, Neil sees the mysterious nun again. When he goes to thank her, she vanishes. He is left standing by a gravestone. On the stone there is a name, Amanda Krueger; just below that is another name, Sister Mary Helena. The nun was the spirit of Freddy\'s mother. Later, Neil falls asleep at his home, where he has the same house Kristen made at the beginning of the film. A light suddenly comes on inside the model house, implying Freddy\'s still alive, which sets up the events of the next film.'] ['After a series of country-wide auditions, 12 young dancers gain entry to the American Ballet Academy . They work hard, attending classes every day for weeks to make them the best dancers they can possibly be, and in preparations for a final dance workshop which will determine the three boys and three girls who will be asked to join the American Ballet Company . The workshop will also provide an opportunity for the students to showcase their talent to other ballet companies across the country. Gaining a leading part in the workshop is therefore essential. Tensions mount between Jonathan , the company\'s aging choreographer and director, and Cooper Nielson , his best dancer, who also wants to choreograph. They also have issues because Kathleen, Cooper\'s ex-girlfriend and fellow ballet dancer, left him for Jonathan. Star student Maureen , a closet bulimic who seems poised for success, discovers that life is passing her by when she meets a pre-med student who shows her life without ballet. Sweet Jody Sawyer , despite body type issues and bad feet, is determined to dance professionally but it appears less and less likely as the movie progresses that she will be good enough. The talented but smart-mouthed Eva  loves to dance but seems destined to be stuck in the back of the corps because of her attitude. Tensions also arise between Charlie  and Cooper. Charlie has a crush on Jody, who had a one-night stand with Cooper and remains infatuated with him. Despite Jonathan\'s objections, Cooper choreographs a rock music based ballet for the workshop. Three ballets are being presented; Jonathan and another choreographer create the other two respectively--the two more "traditional" ballets are not danced to actual ballet music, however. The first is to Mendelssohn\'s Italian Symphony, while Jonathan\'s ballet is set to Rachmaninov\'s 2nd Piano Concerto. Cooper\'s ballet mirrors the relationship between himself, Jonathan, and Kathleen . Jody, Charlie, and Erik  are set to dance the three lead roles when Erik sprains his ankle in a rehearsal. Cooper then steps in to fill the role, and the tensions between Jody, Charlie and Cooper play out on the stage. After the final workshop, Cooper starts his own dance company - much to Jonathan\'s chagrin, as Cooper\'s financial backer is a woman that Jonathan was hoping would donate to his own company. Cooper asks Jody to be a principal dancer as her dancing style, though technically behind, is perfect for the kind of dance he wants in his company. He also asks to date her, but Jody turns him down in favor of Charlie. Maureen decides to give up ballet because she finally realizes that ballet is just something she does well, and not what she wants from life. She decides to attend regular university and also seek help for her eating disorder. Eva is picked by Jonathan to join the prestigious American Ballet Company after proving her worth in the workshop - secretly taking the place of Maureen, who had the lead, in Jonathan\'s ballet. Jody\'s boyfriend Charlie, and their friends Anna  and Erik are also asked to join the American Ballet Company, and Sergei  joins his girlfriend in the San Francisco Ballet Company. There is a subplot in which Cooper attracts the financial support of a flirtatious wealthy female philanthropist . An August 15, 2004 New York Times article entitled "How Much Is That Dancer in the Program?" revealed that Stiefel has a very similar real-life sponsorship relationship with a philanthropist named Anka Palitz.'] ["Zeus and Poseidon meet at a skyscraper, where Zeus reveals that his master lightning bolt is stolen and accuses Poseidon's demigod son Percy Jackson of the theft. Poseidon reminds him that Percy is unaware of his true identity, but Zeus declares that unless Percy returns the lightning bolt to Mount Olympus before the next summer solstice, war is waged. Percy is a seventeen-year-old teenager who appears to be dyslexic, but has a unique ability to stay underwater for a lengthy time. While on a school trip to the local museum, Percy is attacked by a Fury disguised as his substitute teacher, who demands the lightning bolt. Percy's best friend Grover Underwood and Latin teacher Mr. Brunner, both of whom appear disabled, help Percy and scare off the Fury. Upon learning of the Fury's reason for the attack, Mr. Brunner gives Percy a pen, tells him it is a powerful weapon, and has Grover take Percy and his mother Sally to Camp Half-Blood, leaving behind Sally's lazy husband Gabe Ugliano. However, the three are attacked by a minotaur that appears to kill Sally, who is unable to enter the camp. Grover tells Percy to use the pen, and Percy discovers that it is a sword, which he uses to fight the minotaur, without initial success. Percy kills the minotaur with its own horn then faints from shock. Three days later, Percy wakes up in the camp. He learns that he is the son of Poseidon, that Grover is a disguised satyr and his protector, and that Mr. Brunner is the centaur Chiron, also initially disguised. Chiron suggests that Percy go to Mount Olympus to convince Zeus of his innocence. Percy begins training to use his demigod powers, which include water manipulation and using water to heal, and meets other demigods including Annabeth Chase, daughter of Athena, and Luke Castellan, son of Hermes. After assisting in a team exercise, Percy is visited by a fiery apparition of his uncle Hades, who reveals that Sally is with him in the Underworld and that he will return her safely if Percy hands over the lightning bolt. Defying Chiron's orders, Percy decided to go to the Underworld, joined by Grover and Annabeth. They visit Luke, who gives them a map showing three of Persephone's pearls that they can use to escape the Underworld, an old shield, and a pair of winged sneakers Luke stole from his father. The trio heads out, locating the first pearl at an old garden center but encountering Medusa, who tries to kill them until decapitated by Percy; her head is taken with them for later use. They locate the second pearl in the Parthenon in Nashville, and Percy uses the winged shoes to take it from a statue of Athena. However, they are then confronted by the Hydra, which Grover petrifies using Medusa's head. The third pearl is located in Las Vegas in the Lotus Casino, where the three eat lotus flowers and forget their reason for being there. They stay in the casino for five days until Percy's dad Poseidon speaks in Percy's mind, helping Percy return to his senses. Percy then frees Grover and Annabeth from the effects of the flowers, and they flee, discovering that the casino is run by the Lotus-Eaters. With all three pearls in their possession, Percy, Grover, and Annabeth head into the Underworld, the portal to which is located in Hollywood. In the Underworld they meet Hades and his wife Persephone. Though Percy tells Hades that he does not have the lightning bolt, Hades finds it hidden inside Luke's shield, revealing that Luke is the lightning thief. Persephone knocks Hades out with the lightning bolt to get back at him for imprisoning her with him for all eternity and hands the bolt to Percy. However, because they only have three pearls, Grover remains with Persephone to allow Percy's mother to leave. Percy, Annabeth, and Sally teleport to the Empire State Building but are attacked by Luke, who wants to destroy Mount Olympus to secure the demigods' place as the new rulers of the gods. After a fight across Manhattan, Percy defeats Luke and returns the lightning bolt to Zeus, who forgives Percy and allows Poseidon to briefly speak with his son. The film ends with Percy and Annabeth reuniting with Grover, who has grown horns , meaning he is a senior protector, and returning to the camp to continue their training. In a post-credits scene, Gabe is being kicked out of Sally's house. He finds a note from Percy warning him not to open the fridge. Angrily ignoring it, he opens the fridge only to be petrified by Medusa's head."] ['The story takes place in the fictional town of Greendale in "the state of Northern California" and centers on high-schooler Lane Myer , whose girlfriend Beth  dumps him for the arrogant and bullying captain of the high school ski team, Roy Stalin.

Lane\'s family is odd: his mother, Jenny  is a sort of deranged Stepford wife and perhaps the world\'s worst cook; his genius little brother, Badger never speaks but can build lasers and attract trashy women; and his father, Al  is convinced Lane is using drugs. Lane\'s best friend, Charles de Mar  attempts to inhale everyday substances, like the nitrous oxide in a whipped cream can , Jell-O or snow, as if it were cocaine because he "can\'t even get real drugs here."

As the two rivals race, Johnny, Lane\'s persistent paperboy pursues him, repeating that he wants two dollars that are owed .'] ['The film stars three real-life juvenile gangsters, all aged 15, giving an accurate depiction of Chinese teenage gang-life in the Singapore suburbs. The 2003 film features two more gangsters as characters as well as a fight sequence with more affluent English-educated Singapore youths.

Being the closest to the top, he chose to cut the rope to save himself and dropped the other three to their death. He says that he knows his actions were wrong, but the doctor reminds him that when he was first admitted he said anyone would have made the same decision. Angrily he repeats that his actions were wrong, and the doctor says that means they've made progress, but they're working for closure. Seven friends are driving to their friend Brent's house to celebrate their upcoming college graduation. Alex, Brent's new stepsister, unexpectedly shows up to stay, something Brent isn't happy about, but they let her stay, trying to match her up with Freddy. They all party and later that night when everyone else is asleep, Nicole is grabbed by a strange man as she goes for a beer. Her body is then thrown through the window onto a sleeping Freddy, whose screams get the rest of the house down. The letters 'TV' carved into her stomach gets them to watch a video taken earlier, where Nicole is given a gun and told to shoot the sleeping Carlos to save her own life, but she refuses and is killed.

But the killer bandages Carlos and leaves him at the house. When he tells Jennifer that Brent left him, she loses all trust in Brent. Now that everyone's back, Michael leads them to the van to try and escape, but the van is caught by something and can't move.

Alex had run off on her own to get her motorcycle, but the killer fires at her and shes forced to hide behind it until Brent slugs her and drowns her in the lake. He sneaks back to the house to talk to Freddy alone, saying that the boat is OK and if he can just get the gun from Michael they can escape. Freddy fakes a panic attack to get the gun and Brent comes in, but Amber tells what Brent had told her, that the boat was inoperable. Freddy realizes hes been tricked and shoots Brent, and tries to force everyone else out of the house.

The professor experiments on the survivor, trying to determine the source of her immortality, with apparent disregard for the rotted state of her body. When he has created a serum that he believes will bring back the dead and grant immortality, he murders one of his students and brings her back to his lab. He cuts off all of her clothes and then he injects her with the serum. She returns to life and infects the professor, then breaks out of the building and, while naked, begins infecting students when they try to help her. A month later, the university has a full-fledged outbreak, which is confirmed by AMC reconnaissance teams. Ellis, an agent for AMS, goes in search of his fellow agent, Alexandra Morgan, also known as Nightingale. He finds her on a date at a restaurant, but before his arrival, the cook was bitten by the infected professor while on break. Alexandra is forced to execute the zombies on site, and returns to base with Ellis. They are ordered by Colonel Jordan Casper to retrieve a blood sample from the originally infected specimen on campus, warning that missiles will level the campus at midnight, regardless of whether the agents are still present or not. She assigns a gender-mixed Special Forces team of U.S. Marines to provide them with backup. Ellis openly questions the competence of the soldiers, leading to friction between the two units. Upon arrival at Cuesta Verde University, the soldiers encounter zombies. Their newest member, an overweight private who has no combat experience panics and falls to the ground. A second member of his team engages the zombie, but his M16A4 is knocked away before he can fire. He and the zombie engage in hand-to-hand combat. The zombie is killed, but is able to bite the soldier on the hand. He attempts to hide the injury, but is discovered and his arm is severed in an attempt to stem the infection. He transforms into a zombie despite the amputation, and bites the squad medic, before both are executed by Ellis. The team continues forward into the university proper. They proceed to battle through the hordes of infected, splitting into two teams to search for the original zombie. Two female soldiers, Lieutenant Henson and Private Rodriguez, and a male soldier, Bart investigate the dorms. They break into a female dormitory where they find the deceased naked body of a zombie. Bart attempts to pose and have a picture taken with the corpse, and is bitten by a mosquito trapped in the room. Fearing contamination, but unwilling to execute Bart, who is threatening them with a handgun, Henson handcuffs Bart to a radiator and the two soldiers exit the room, falling back to the van. Meanwhile, the second team, including Ellis and Alexandra, are attacked multiple times. Eventually, every soldier escorting them is killed, including the leader of the unit, Sergeant Griffin. They fight their way to the professor\'s laboratory, and find the original specimen still imprisoned, as well as a pair of students who had survived. They enter the confinement room and extract blood from the zombie, but are forced to kill it when it breaks free. The two students who had allowed them into the confinement room are overrun and torn apart by zombies, and the two agents escape while the zombies are feeding on the bodies. As this occurs, Henson and Rodriguez make it to the extraction vehicle, a van. There, they prepare to rescue the agents, but Rodriguez is bitten by a zombie who was locked in the back of the van by the soldier assigned to guard it. Henson executes Rodriguez, and the duo arrive in front of the science building as Ellis and Alexandra fight their way through a horde of zombies. The agents make it to the van, but the blood sample vial is destroyed in the process. They are forced to turn back, with ten minutes before missiles level the campus, and fight their way back to the confinement room. They retrieve a second vial, but Henson is bitten on the ankle. She remains behind and commits suicide, as the agents escape by smearing zombie blood and tissue on themselves, disguising themselves as zombies. They escape back to the van, where they find that Bart broke free from the dormitory by amputating his hand. He threatens Ellis at gunpoint, arguing that they could make millions from the vial of blood. Ellis is forced to give him the vial. Bart decides to kill Ellis anyway, but is shot in the back by Alexandra before he can. His dying action is to pull the pin on a hand grenade, destroying the vial in the process. The two agents escape before the missiles level the campus. Alexandra is wounded, but uncertain of whether it\'s a bite or not. Ellis refuses to execute her, and the two leave the city, finding that the infection has spread to the rest of the city.'] ['Roland  is getting married  and Slim , who scoffs at the idea of marriage, but is furious at Roland for disappearing.

Meanwhile, Amy is locked in a room also containing Sandra and Simon\'s corpses. When Amy manages to break out, she finds Vanessa being hanged from the bell. Amy runs out of the tower into the arms of Trevor, who has found out that the thing the victims all had in common was their having worked on Travis\' thesis film. They review Travis\' film, which turns out to be awful, and find out that somebody placed Travis\' credits onto another film. They suspect Toby, the only person working on the film left alive.

He holds Trevor at gunpoint and Amy yells to him is this what he wants. He reveals feeling trapped in a teaching position since failing to win the Hitchcock award in his student days for which he blames Amy\'s father, who cast the deciding vote against him.

As Trevor is about to accept the award on his late brother\'s behalf, a sniper appears in the rafters, only to be shot down by Reese. The altercation is then revealed to be a scene in Amy\'s new film "Urban Legends". We also see that Toby and Graham survived their attacks and are now busily working on her behalf.

Now without friends, shunned by Aaron, and distrusted by everyone at school, even being distrusted by her own parents, Cady decides to make amends by taking full blame for the Burn Book. Though severely punished by her confession, her guilt dissolves and she returns to her old personality. As part of her punishment and her reformation, she joins the Mathletes, which Damien and Regina both described earlier as "social suicide," in their competition. There, Cady has an epiphany while competing against a very unattractive girl, realizing that even if she made fun of the girl\'s appearance it would not stop the girl from beating her. At the Spring Fling dance, Cady is elected Spring Fling Queen, but in her acceptance speech, she declares her victory is meaningless: they are all wonderful in their own way and thus the victory belongs to everyone. As a symbolic gesture, she breaks her tiara and distributes the pieces to her classmates. Cady makes up with Janis and Damien, reconciles with Aaron, and reaches a truce with the Plastics. The film ends with the Plastics disbanding by the start of the new school year: Regina joins the lacrosse team as a way to channel her anger positively, Karen becomes the school weather girl, Gretchen joins the "Cool Asians" clique and is their biggest follower, and Cady dates Aaron as well as hanging out with Damien, and Janis, who starts a relationship with Cady\'s fellow mathlete Kevin. Cady reflects that the "Girl World" she lives in is at peace.'] ["The day begins with a popular student, Carol Manning , jokingly asking Marty Rantzen , the school nerd, to have sex with her in the women's locker room.

This prank ends when the students' coach comes in to find out what is happening. The students are forced to perform a vigorous workout in the gymnasium.

He has been accepted to the prestigious Georgetown University, but will only be able to afford it if he can win a large scholarship. With graduation approaching, he struggles to find anything truly memorable about his high school experience which is quite hard due to his social staus. However, his luck changes when he meets his beautiful next door neighbor Danielle . The outlandish Danielle and the steady Matthew each turn out to be the perfect complement for the other, and they are immediately smitten with one another. However, the relationship is challenged when Matthew discovers through his porn-enthusiast friend, Eli , that Danielle recently was an adult film actress under the stage name "Athena". Following Eli\'s advice on how to deal with this incredible revelation, Matthew takes Danielle to a sleazy motel. Danielle guesses that Matthew has discovered her past and punishes him by performing a striptease and offering herself to him. When Matthew becomes distressed and asks why she is degrading herself, Danielle calls him out on his base intentions and abruptly ends the relationship. Matthew goes to Danielle\'s house the following day and attempts to reconcile with her, but learns that she is returning to the porn industry, and is leaving for Las Vegas with her ex-colleague , a porn producer named Kelly . Matthew, riddled with guilt, follows Danielle to Las Vegas to find her at an adult film convention where Kelly menacingly warns Matthew not to interfere with his business. When Matthew convinces Danielle not to rejoin the industry, Kelly abducts Matthew from school and physically assaults him, saying that Danielle\'s failure to arrive on set has cost him $30,000. Kelly offers to let Matthew erase the debt by breaking into rival producer Hugo Posh \'s home to steal an award statuette, but after Matthew has entered the house Kelly quietly calls in a robbery report and leaves the premises. Caught by Posh, Matthew narrowly avoids the police and rushes to his scholarship award dinner. Accidentally high on ecstasy that Kelly had told him was aspirin, he improvises a deeply sentimental speech but loses out on the scholarship - to a student who strongly resembles the passionless, pre-Danielle version of Matthew. Kelly gets his money back by stealing the $25,000 Matthew raised to bring Samnang, a brilliant Cambodian student, to study in the United States. Not wanting to explain his connections to the adult film industry, Matthew had previously introduced Kelly to the bank staff as his student advisor. Although Matthew has not committed a crime, he still fears that he will face expulsion or criminal charges for his unwitting role in the fraud, and he reluctantly turns to Danielle for help. Danielle calls in a few friends from her days as a porn star, and they agree to make a video for Hugo Posh on prom night, on school grounds, and using Matthew\'s classmates as actors. After the successful shoot, and after Eli has been dropped off with the tape\'s master copy, Danielle and Matthew have sex for the first time in their limousine. Despite Danielle\'s past, it is the first time she has truly made love, and the moment is tender and significant for each of them. The next morning Matthew is shocked to find Kelly, holding the tape he has stolen from Eli\'s home, seated with his parents and school principal at the dining room table. Kelly asks to speak privately with Matthew and says that unless he is given half of all profits, he will play the tape immediately. Matthew, following Danielle\'s repeated advice to "just go with it", refuses because the money he will earn for the tape rightfully belongs to Samnang. Kelly repeats his threat, but Matthew stands up for himself and dares him to show the tape, stating that he no longer cares about his now-ruined future. As the tape begins to play, it becomes clear that Matthew and his friends have made a progressive, comprehensive sex education tape rather than a pornographic film. With no more cards left to play, Kelly finally and grudgingly admits defeat but smiles at Matthew\'s initiative. Hugo Posh and Matthew make millions from the video. Hugo Posh keeps his word and pays for Samnang to come to the USA, while Matthew has enough money to attend Georgetown and take Danielle to DC with him. Matthew sends Kelly a box of Cuban cigars, which he happily accepts. The final scene shows Matthew driving into Georgetown University in a BMW Z4. Matthew\'s story ends with him getting the girl of his dreams and a chance at the future he has always wanted.'] ['The film is an adaptation of poet and memoirist Jim Carroll\'s  juvenile diaries chronichling his kaleidoscopic free-fall into the harrowing world of drug addiction.

A pugilistic ex-convict known as "Crump\'s Brother" is picked up by a local teen while hitchhiking on the freeway and informs him about two women  he intends to party with in Torrance Beach. The teen then informs his friends about the situation, but no one wishes to anger Crump\'s Brother by tagging along; one of them, Tack  leaves with his own agenda. The title credits introduce main characters Joe  and Hubbs , as they drive around town in their 1970s Volkswagen Type III Squareback, The "Blue Torpedo" looking for drugs and women. Hubbs is the loud, dominant member of the duo while Joe is his loyal, but far more passive friend. They come across Tack, who informs them of the girls, and they reluctantly agree to take him if he provides gas money. Their friend Crump, the gas station attendant, also tells them of the girls, and realize Tack intends to take Crump\'s Brother\'s "chicks" for himself. Hubbs decides to double-cross Tack, party with the girls, and expose Tack\'s deception if Crump\'s Brother finds out; they give Crump misleading information to keep Crump and his brother preoccupied, strand Tack at the gas station, and head for Torrance Beach. They arrive at the house and find an extremely attractive girl named Lanie  who sends them off to a liquor store for alcohol. When they return, they find the homeowner\'s daughter Jill, a homely misanthrope and Lanie\'s friend; Jill is very reluctant to have them over, but is unable to dissuade Lanie from getting drunk and taking them out to find parties. Tack, in the meantime, conscripts his nerdy friend Norm "Snot-rag" Hankey to take him to the beach. They arrive at the house and after a brief scuffle, Tack entices cooperation with news of a party in Palos Verdes, much to Joe and Hubbs\' chagrin. At the house party, Muldoon , the party host, lets the girls in but shuts everyone else out. Lanie leaves following an altercation with Muldoon and drafts Joe to take her swimming in a neighbor\'s pool when she hears he has marijuana. The police shut down the party, and Hubbs and Jill locate Joe and Lanie next door, where they continue to party until the owner chases them out. Lanie is smitten with Hubbs\' aggressive nature, much to Joe\'s chagrin, and the two walk upstairs for sex. Downstairs, Jill and Joe try to navigate a tenuous chemistry, but Jill storms out to the beach. Having lost their beer to the police, Tack and the others raid a liquor warehouse for beer, and head for the house. Joe and Jill partially reconcile but return to find Tack and the Guzzlers converging on the home. A fight breaks out between Joe and Tack and Jill runs inside, eventually letting Joe back in and locking the door. After getting stoned, Hubbs tells Joe he\'s arranged for Lanie to give him fellatio as a "birthday present." Joe finds that Lanie asleep, covers her up, and walks out; he finds Hubbs with Jill making out on the couch; Joe is upset but learns that Jill was the instigator. They are interrupted when Crump\'s Brother arrives outside and begins to break down the door. They flee to the kitchen but shortly afterwards, they hear the commotion dying out; Jill\'s father, Warren  has returned from a college reunion and beaten the entire crowd of kids—including Crump\'s Brother—to unconsciousness with great ease. He holds Joe and Hubbs hostage awaiting the arrival of the police, but eventually, a condescending lecture provokes a fight and Joe and Hubbs dramatically escape just ahead of the police. Jill, enamored with Joe, gives him her full name and geographical location  so he can look her up later. The police arrest the entire crew of drunken teenagers, and Joe and Hubbs escape in the "Blue Torpedo." Hubbs jocularly chides Joe for his apparent cowardice in moving on Lanie and Jill, and dismisses Jill as a viable partner. Joe, no longer tolerant of Hubb\'s attitude, wrestles a surprised Hubbs into submission while driving and forces him to capitulate that Jill is "cool." Joe then places the Blue Öyster Cult 8-track tape into the deck and plays "Don\'t Fear the Reaper." The song plays as the Blue Torpedo drives off through the night. Following the credits, Joe and Hubbs are offered Blue Öyster Cult concert t-shirts outside a convenience store by two men, but Joe refuses because the shirts are bootlegs, and not official. The scalpers are played by actual Blue Öyster Cult band members Eric Bloom and Donald "Buck Dharma" Roeser.'] ['Linda Linda Linda tells the story of a group of  four high school girls who decide to put together a band for Hiiragi-sai, their school cultural festival.

The Top Ten is briefly concerned when Bernadette fails to show up at the Silent Woman. They soon get over it when their argument with another customer results in one of them putting a pet mouse into his beer; mayhem ensues, and the Top Ten flee the scene. On the way home, the Top Ten see a drawbridge going up and decide to play a game of chicken: all cars in the game must make it across before the bridge is completely raised . A protesting Ginny is shoved into a car by fellow Top Ten member Ann Thomerson. Every car jumps the drawbridge save one. As the car goes over the drawbridge Ginny yells "Mother!" and makes it safely across. After the car stops Ginny runs from the vehicle into the darkness home. On the way home she stops by her mother\'s grave to tell her she\'s popular and hangs out with the Top Ten all the time. Ginny is confronted by her father about coming home after her curfew. Unbeknownst to either of them, Top Ten member Etienne Vercoures, a French foreign exchange student has followed her home. He enters Ginny\'s room, steals a pair of her underwear and escapes without being seen. Ginny shares a handful of lost, repressed memories with her on-call psychiatrist, Dr. David Faraday. She underwent an experimental medical procedure, involving surgery to restore brain tissue, after surviving a harrowing accident at a drawbridge. As Ginny attempts to resume her normal life, her fellow Top Ten members are murdered in very vicious and violent ways: Etienne is strangled when his scarf gets caught in the spokes of his motorcycle ; Greg has his neck crushed while lifting weights, and yet, the killer who always sports a pair of black gloves, is never seen. Until one night, Top-Ten member Alfred, who\'s had a strong crush on Ginny, follows Ginny to her mother\'s grave and is then gutted with a pair of garden shears by Ginny. On the weekend of her 18th birthday, Mr. Wainwright leaves on a business trip. After a school dance, Ginny invites Steve, another member of the Top Ten, to her place for a midnight snack. She prepares shish kebabs, and feeds him, while they drink and smoke marijuana. Then, Steve unsuspectingly leaves his mouth open and Ginny shoves the kebab skewer violently down his throat; leaving little doubt that Ginny may be the killer at this point. The following morning, Ginny is taking a shower fighting to remember everything up to that point. In flashbacks, the following is revealed. Ginny\'s mother, a newly-inducted socialite, invited the Top Ten to Ginny\'s birthday celebration four years earlier. Instead, the Top Ten went to Ann\'s party. Drunk and unstable, Mrs. Wainwright confronted the grounds-keeper. Ginny\'s mother learned that she had a reputation as the town whore; ergo, neither she nor her daughter were welcome at the Thomersons\'. This led to Mrs. Wainwright attempting to drive across a bridge that was in the process of opening. With Ginny screaming, her mother finally stopped in the middle of the bridge as each side was still raising. The car fell in between the bridge halves and Mrs. Wainwright drowned in her car, although Ginny swam to safety. Ginny realizes that she may have killed her friends after all, including Ann, who had just paid her a visit. With Ginny\'s 18th birthday steadily approaching, she struggles to get answers from Dr. Faraday; when he fails to provide any, she kills him with a fire poker. Mr. Wainwright returns from his business trip, ready to celebrate his daughter\'s 18th birthday. Entering their house, he sees blood and frantically attempts to locate Ginny. Instead, Mr. Wainwright finds Greg\'s girlfriend Amelia in shock in the courtyard clutching a gift, his late wife\'s grave  and Dr. Faraday\'s corpse. Entering a cottage which serves as the Wainwrights\' guest quarters, he makes a ghastly discovery. The corpses of all the murdered Top Ten members are seated around the table, which has been set to look exactly as it did four years ago. The corpse of Mrs. Wainwright is seated there as well. Then Ginny enters, carrying a large cake and singing "Happy Birthday" to herself. Already distraught, Mr. Wainwright bursts into tears when his daughter casually admits to committing the murders. Ginny then slits her father\'s throat with the same large knife she used to cut the cake. He never sees the real Ginny, who is sedated, seated at this table as the killer\'s only living guest. Ginny\'s doppelganger rants about having done all of this for Ginny, who then awakens to discover that the second Ginny is really Ann in disguise. Ann has been embittered by the revelation of her father\'s affair with Ginny\'s mother. It turns out that both girls are half-sisters. Ann slaughtered the six main members of the clique, that never showed up for her birthday party, expressly for the purpose of framing Ginny - who suddenly breaks free, takes Ann\'s knife and kills her with it. As she stands over her half-sister\'s corpse, a detective walks in on Ginny and the horrifying carnage that surrounds her. He stares at Ginny and demands, "What have you done?" The audience is then left to wonder if Ginny will be cleared of the killings or arrested for them. We hear Ginny singing "Happy Birthday to Me" as the film ends.'] ['Cast December 2007}}.

David, a young boy living in 1950\'s Indiana, is neighbor to the Chandlers. When Meg arrives, he is instantly infatuated, attracted by her innocence. Aunt Ruth allows the children of the neighborhood to travel freely in and out of her house, offering them beer and cigarettes. Meg quickly becomes a target to Ruth, who belittles her, making suggestions that she is a whore, and starves her. One day David arrives at the house to find Meg\'s cousins tickling her. She knocks Ralphie to the floor, wanting him to back off, and runs from the room. Ruth punishes Susan for Meg\'s actions, as Meg\'s cousins hold her back. Ruth then takes the ring that Meg wears around her neck, which belonged to her mother. A few days later, Meg stops a policeman and tells him what happened. As punishment, Ruth, her children and their friends tie Meg in the cellar with her hands over her head. They play a bizarre game of "confession," and when Meg has nothing to confess, she is stripped naked. They gag her and leave her there. That night, the boys sneak back downstairs, giving her water. They agree to loosen her bindings, but only if she lets them touch her. She refuses, but David loosens them anyway. A while later, Meg is untied but refuses to eat, claiming that her mouth is too dry from dehydration to swallow it without choking. Ruth again punishes Susan for Meg\'s disobedience. The kids of the town treat her like a play thing, beating, cutting and burning her. David tries to tell his parents, but can\'t. Police Officer Jennings  eventually arrives at the house, having had their suspicions raised after a local boy talked to them. However, they leave finding nothing. David decides that it is time for Meg to escape, and unties her, promising her he will leave her money in the forest for her to run away with. The next day, David descends into the cellar to find Meg tied to the bed, being raped by Willie. David tries to leave but Donny stops him. Donny steps forward, wanting to rape Meg as well, but Ruth does not want him to, considering it to be incest to have sex with her so soon after his brother. Ruth instead offers Eddie or David to take a turn with her. When David declines, Ruth heats a needle and carves a message on Meg\'s stomach, telling her that now she will never be able to be with a man. Ruth then decides that they should make Meg \'perfect\' by giving her a clitorectomy, thus "destroying her desire for men forever." At this, David runs for the door, planning to escape and tell somebody. Several of the boys chase him, stopping him on the stairs. As one holds a knife to his neck, Ruth tells the boys to tie him up and says they\'ll "do something about him later" and one of the boys kicks him in the groin before turning their attention back to Meg. Bound on the floor, he can only watch helplessly as Meg is mutilated with a blowtorch. The next morning David awakes still on the cellar floor. He frees himself from his bindings, and finds Susan sitting with an unconscious Meg. Susan tells David that Meg did not escape the night that he untied her because she was caught trying to take Susan with her. Although David\'s plan was to come back for Susan after Meg escaped, Susan had told Meg that Ruth has been touching her on a regular basis to the extent of making her bleed, so Meg didn\'t want to leave her behind. Susan then tearfully insists that Meg should have just gone without her and saved herself while she could, but David tells Susan everything was going to be alright. David is afraid that Meg won\'t survive much longer without help, so he lights a fire in the cellar. As the smoke rises, Ruth enters the room and is beaten to death by David with Susan\'s crutch. Jennings arrives, taking Susan from the room and going for help. David retrieves Meg\'s mother\'s ring from Ruth, and gives it to her before she finally dies, her body finally succumbing to its wounds. As an adult, David reflects on how his past still haunts him to his present day, though as Meg taught him, "It\'s what you do last that really counts."'] ['On October 2, 1988, Donnie Darko , a troubled teenager living in Middlesex, Virginia, is awakened and led outside by a figure in a monstrous rabbit costume, who introduces himself as "Frank" and tells him the world will end in 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes and 12 seconds.

From this association, Annie begins to feel the effects of her actions on her conscience, and stops to visit Nick\'s room to get a better sense of who he is. The two realize the tragedy of their lives was that they were so similar that given different choices and events, the two could have been close. Diane catches Annie in his room, and she flees. She returns to the woods to find Nick\'s body, only to see that it has been moved. She confronts Pete, and then Marcus trying to learn the location of the body. Marcus tells her, but shoots her in the belly as she leaves. She shoots Marcus in return, then calls the police to tell them where to find Nick. Nick is saved just in time, but Annie succumbs to her wound after visiting him in the hospital.  In the Swedish film "Den Osynlige", of which The Invisible is a remake, "Niklas"  does not regain consciousness, and "Annelie"  does not end up being shot nor does she die, but instead turns herself in after her confession and apology. Also, in the original, Pete dies after his suicide attempt. Neither version is true to the novel where the "Annie" character is a neo-nazi. She never regrets anything in the novel and is not displayed in a sympathetic light. Also, in the novel, all the teens are 14-15, "Nick\'s" girlfriend is pregnant, and "Nick\'s" mother is not excessively controlling.'] ['It is the summer of 1987 and James Brennan , a virgin, has just graduated with a degree in comparative literature from Oberlin College.

Later that week, James goes for a drink with Em and she is surprised to learn James has never had sex. After leaving, James and Em share their first kiss. The following day, James tells Connell about his strong feelings for Em, which Connell reports to her. Em later tells James that she wants to take things slow due to problems in her life, leaving James feeling confused and upset.

Prompted by Frigo, the park\'s mentally-challenged parking official tells James he saw Em and Connell doing "push-ups without any pants on" in the back of Connell\'s car. James goes to Connell\'s mother\'s house, which is where Lisa P. told him that Connell takes girls to have sex, and sees Em leaving. Shocked to see James, Em becomes tongue-tied and cannot explain. James leaves angrily, leaving a broken-hearted, crying Em by herself. James tells Lisa P. about the affair and asks her not to tell anyone, but not long after, she tells her friend Kelly. Upon noticing that all the park employees know, Em quits and moves back to New York. James chastises Lisa P. for dismissing Em as a "homewrecker" while seeing Connell as blameless. Heartbroken, he drunkenly crashes his dad\'s car into a tree and passes out. The next morning, his mother angrily wakes him up and tells him that he has to pay using his summer earnings to fix the damage. Because he must pay for the car, James doesn\'t have enough money to go to graduate school. Despite his setbacks, he heads for New York City with his parents\' blessing, as they finally decide that it\'s time to let James do what is best for him. In New York, James waits outside Em\'s apartment. She is reluctant to talk to him, feeling she has ruined everything. James tells her that he sees her in a different way from the way she sees herself, making it clear that he has fallen in love with her. Touched, Em brings James up to her apartment. James reveals he is not going to Columbia this year, and considers next year. He gets out of his wet clothes and finds that Em still has an Adventureland shirt.

The two boys are lamenting their lot in life and fantasizing about being popular and being able to attract girls. The scene ends when the two geeks are pantsed by school bullies, Ian  and Max .  The action then cuts to Wyatt\'s house, where the boys have the house to themselves because Wyatt\'s parents went to Cincinnati for the weekend to meet Wyatt\'s sister Chloe\'s fiance. Inspired by the film Frankenstein, the boys decide to create a "virtual" and "perfect" woman on their home computer . They design their "perfect" woman by filling their computer with various forms of data and images. When their computer reaches capacity, they decide to hack into a government mainframe for more processing power and data storage capacity. As a finishing touch they connect a Barbie doll to Wyatt\'s computer through a series of wires and electrodes. At the exact moment they hit "enter" to execute their program, a lightning bolt strikes their house leading to a series of supernatural occurrences. The scene ends with a violent explosion and when the smoke clears a beautiful woman  emerges from Wyatt\'s bathroom. Her first words to the boys are "so, what would you little maniacs like to do first?" In addition to being totally devoted to them, this woman has a number of superhuman abilities, such as memory manipulation, molecular manipulation, and reality warping. Despite her willingness to be everything Wyatt and Gary wanted, the boys are too intimidated to take advantage of the opportunities presented by her appearance, as when they keep their jeans on while showering with her. Realizing that the boys need to lower some of their inhibitions, she transmogrifies their poorly-styled outfits into more flattering clothes before taking them out for a night on the town in a pink 1959 Cadillac convertible that she conjures out of thin air. After the boys name her Lisa, she conjures fake identification for the boys, and takes them to a blues club. Although initially uncomfortable in these new surroundings, the trio eventually end up ingratiating themselves to the staff and some regulars, in part with the help of alcohol, staying until late at night. As the trio head home, Lisa asks Wyatt what he will do about his older brother, Chet , a brash military school student who physically and emotionally abuses him, and extorts blackmail money as well, as he does when he brings the inebriated Gary home past his curfew. After putting Gary to bed, Wyatt shares a kiss with Lisa. When Wyatt begs Lisa to stay out of sight so that Chet does not see her, she tells him that he cannot hide in fear from his own brother, but does as Wyatt asks. When Chet appears, he further harasses and extorts more money from Wyatt when he sees Wyatt wearing Lisa\'s purple panties. At a shopping mall, Gary and Wyatt, feeling secure after their time with Lisa, are humiliated again by Ian and Max, who dump an Icees onto them in front of the whole mall, upsetting their own girlfriends, Deb  and Hilly . Ian and Max offer an insincere apology to their girlfriends, who relent because Ian and Max have high social standing at school, and do not wish to give up that privilege themselves. Ian and Max then spot Lisa on the escalator and abandon the girls to run after her. When they catch up with her, she invites them to a party at Wyatt\'s. Gary then pulls up in a Porsche 928 and he, Wyatt, and Lisa leave together, to Ian and Max\'s chagrin. The milquetoast Wyatt begs Lisa to cancel the party, but she refuses, pointing out that it will lead to the popularity that he and Gary wanted. She then picks up Gary at his house, but when Gary\'s parents, Al  and Lucy , object to Gary going out with a woman Lisa\'s age, Lisa stands up to Gary\'s father, pointing a gun at him, and manipulates their memories so that Lucy forgets the incident, and Al forgets he has a son. In shock over this turn of events on the ride back to Wyatt\'s house, Lisa tries to lighten the moment by shooting Gary in the face with the gun, revealing it to be a water pistol. Back at the house, the boys are skeptical that anyone will show up because they have no friends, but when the doorbell rings, a crowd of teenagers is present, and the party begins. Gary and Wyatt, however, still too intimidated to socialize, lock themselves in the bathroom. At the party are Ian, Max, Deb, and Hilly. Deb and Hilly meet Gary and Wyatt in the bathroom, shocked to discover that they, not Lisa, are the hosts of the party. Meanwhile, Max and Ian, after being belittled by the man tending bar, encounter Lisa, and try to make a pass at her. She refuses, explaining that she "belongs" to Gary and Wyatt, and does whatever they say. Ian and Max then scheme to offer Gary and Wyatt permission to date their own girlfriends in exchange for dating Lisa, leading Gary and Wyatt to explain how they created her, and an attempt to recreate the process in Wyatt\'s bedroom with the computer. They forget, however, to connect the computer to a Barbie doll, instead leaving it clamped to a Time magazine on whose cover is Pershing medium-range ballistic missile. As soon as the machine starts up, the kitchen turns blue, a painting starts dancing, the chimney proceeds to suck up all the furniture in the living room and launch it into the lake out back, and the "Weird Science" song starts playing. The missile, like Lisa, becomes real and ends up emerging in the middle of Wyatt\'s house from underground. When Gary and Wyatt are dejected by this, Lisa decides to provoke a confrontation in order to spur them to stand up for themselves. She conjures a group of mutant bikers to disrupt the party. At first the bikers intimidate and humiliate Gary and Wyatt, but after they accost Deb and Hilly, Gary and Wyatt stand up to the mutants, with Gary producing the gun that Lisa used earlier with his parents. After forcing the mutants to leave, Gary assures Wyatt that the gun is a water pistol by firing it, but when a real bullet fires out of it, everyone present, including Deb and Hilly, are impressed by the boys. They end up pairing off, Gary with Deb, and Wyatt with Hilly. The following morning, Chet returns, and is outraged by the state of the house, in particular his bedroom , and further terrorizes Wyatt and his friends. Lisa, however, instructs Gary and Wyatt to take Deb and Hilly home, and then confronts Chet, informing him that he will no longer threaten, abuse or extort money from Wyatt, much to Chet\'s amusement. Gary and Wyatt take the girls home, each one sharing a kiss with his new girlfriend, though they are left with the question of what to do with Lisa. Back at the house, Lisa has transformed Chet into a squat, green, grotesque creature, humbling him enough to apologize to Wyatt. They then speak to Lisa, who understands that the boys now have girlfriends, which is all she ever wanted for them. After saying their goodbyes, she disappears in a cloud of smoke and the damage to the house, along with Chet\'s transformation, is immediately reversed, just in time for the return of Wyatt\'s parents. In the epilogue, a group of male high school gym students socialize, until they hear the new gym teacher\'s whistle. When their teacher turns out to be Lisa, dressed in form-hugging leotard and a cutoff T-shirt, the entire class of boys faint and Lisa looks to the camera and winks.'] ['Matt Stifler, the younger brother of Steve Stifler, is eager to enter the family business of making porn films so he can prove himself to his older brother.

In a biology class they are dissecting a fetal pig. When it\'s time to clean up from the dissection, Thayer Mangeres, a classmate who always sits beside her because of their last names are close alphabetically, asks people around their table how much they will bet him if he drinks the juice from the fetus. As everyone is putting their money on the table, Amber is completely disgusted. Thayer then tells everybody to keep their money, implying to them that he won\'t drink it, but he says he will for free. He drinks the whole cup and everyone is surprised, but nauseous, especially Amber, later telling Thayer that she thinks nothing of him. Ever since that day, he harasses her every time he gets the chance to. The next year they are put in Creative Writing and Study Hall together. Thayer doesn\'t come to either of the classes because he was skipping school that day to get high with his friend. For the next couple of days, it\'s hard for Amber and Thayer to get along. In cheer leading practice Amber is doing her stunts really well with a classmate, but the coach pulls her aside telling her she will have to switch to another stuntman who is not very good. Amber is upset by this, thinking her life is starting to unravel with both this situation and the one with Thayer. At a party that night, he eats fishes from a bowl that she caught earlier that day and everyone is watching, but warning Amber who did not know about this. Very angry, Amber pushes him and continually does asking him why he is such a freak. The next day in Writing Class, Thayer continues to harass Amber, as a new girl who is stereotyped as a punk named Tabitha just moved from California, walks in the class and is assigned to a seat by them. Eventually Tabitha and Thayer form a friendship, and knowing that he does not like Amber and bullies her, she does the same. By the soda machine, Thayer is trying to make Amber jealous by licking Tabitha\'s neck, unbeknownst to Tabitha that he is doing this to make Amber envy, and thinks he actually likes her.

On the same night Amber walks in to her home, which is completely opposite of Thayer\'s house, with no one there. She opens the fridge to get her dinner as it seems that her parents are never there, showing that Amber and Thayer have something in common - they have a difficult home life from the personality they show at school. In Creative Writing, Thayer starts to show his emotions in his poems, and Amber realizes this because she feels exactly the same way. As they progress, Amber offers Thayer an \'extra\' packed orange from her bookbag. Thayer begins the start of their friendship by asking Amber questions through writing notes to each other in his notebook. As their friendship grows, they joke and listen to music together. Thayer begins falling in love with Amber the more they talk. During Creative Writing, Thayer sends Amber signals in his poems. As Amber hears these poems in class, she knows they are about her. She\'s not sure if she feels the same about him because of their different social groups, although she is having strange dreams of kissing him. Thayer and Amber\'s lives and homes are different, even though they are both experiencing trouble. Thayer is struggling at home with his family. His dad beats him and drunken brother does the same, but his sister Jeannie is very compassionate toward him as he is the same to her. Amber is mostly alone when her parents are gone doing unexplained things. At the sandbar one night, Amber has sex with a school friend as Thayer watches her secretly. Feeling betrayed, Thayer writes another paper about Amber but this time, it\'s about the night before. He starts becoming rude again and is harassing her verbally again but this time in his poem. When the teacher realizes that he\'s insulting one of the students, he sends Thayer outside with him. Tabitha talks to Amber about last night saying everyone knows about it and it\'s going around. She tells Amber that Amber is jealous of her and Thayer\'s "relationship". Amber, pissed off, takes out hers and Thayer\'s notebook and throws it onto Tabitha\'s desk. After looking at a few pages, Tabitha dramatically leaves the classroom. Everyone rushes to see the notebook talking about how they feel sorry for Amber, thinking he was a creep for sending her poems hinting he has feelings for her, as Amber just sits there. Her life turns back to normal because she doesn\'t associate with him anymore. Until in the hallway Thayer harasses Amber yelling to her why she gave away their notebook. After being nose to nose, literally, Thayer walks away without an answer from her, as Amber yells at him "because I hate you!" Thayer eventually forgives Amber but tries to impress her again, after Tabitha mischievously attempts to spill purple nail polish in Amber\'s book bag, when he grabs her wrist, as he still seems to care about Amber despite her giving away the notebook. After eating 4 brown tablets which Thayer tells Amber they\'re drugs, which she doesn\'t believe, Thayer convulses foam and has a seizure on the floor. The whole class has to leave the room and Amber watches through the window on the door as Thayer goes unconscious. After the overdose, Thayer never returned to school.

Eventually, Amber informs him that she is getting married, Thayer remains silent for a second and then starts talking about how easy it would be to fake his own death. Amber debates with him a little bit telling him that she would know that he wasn\'t dead, to which he smirks and says "No, you wouldn\'t" and walks off. The scene briefly switches back to the present and then to another memory when Thayer follows Amber into the bathroom of a movie theatre the same day of the beach meeting.

Elle is upset that her dog\'s mother is in a make-up testing laboratory, and decides to take it upon herself to be the "voice for those who can\'t speak" and to outlaw animal testing. While working for Congresswoman Victoria Rudd , Elle is met with skepticism and other barriers common to Washington politics. Rudd\'s member of staff, Timothy, sarcastically calls her "Capitol Barbie".  After a variety of ups and downs including a failed attempt to improve her work environment by having her co-workers write compliments about one another and place them in the "snap cup", Elle starts to lose her faith in Washington politics. As the story moves along, Elle discovers that Bruiser is actually gay, after she is paged by "The Paws that Refreshes: A Doggy Day Spa." Bruiser has been affectionate with Leslie, a Rottweiller owned by Congressman Stan Marks , the Chairman of the Committee on Energy and Commerce which has jurisdiction over Bruiser\'s Bill. Elle also finds that Congresswoman Libby Hauser , the Ranking Member of the same committee, was a member of Delta Nu . As a result, both Marks and Hauser warm to Elle and eventually come to support Bruiser\'s Bill. Elle also discovers that Congresswoman Rudd has actually been working against her. Rudd has been doing so in an effort to satisfy the interests of a major campaign donor named "Bob" . However, Rudd is eventually blackmailed into supporting Elle\'s petition, because Rudd\'s Chief of Staff, Grace Rossiter  eavesdrops on a recorded conversation during which Rudd admits to Elle that she has been working against Bruiser\'s Bill in order to help Rudd\'s sponsors who want to continue with tests on animals. As Grace is appalled that Rudd lied to Elle and blamed it on her, Grace and Elle eventually reach a place of mutual respect, especially after Grace admits she came to Washington D.C. with an enthusiasm not unlike Elle\'s, but later lost that idealism when she discovered how dirty politics could really be. With the help of her friends, Elle\'s petition is successful, and Bruiser\'s Bill is brought to the floor of the House. Elle and Emmett get married in a park in D.C., albeit not at Fenway Park as they had planned, but standing on the home plate which has been delivered to D.C. by the UPS Guy ([[Bruce Thomas . In the final scene of the movie, when Emmett asks where to live, Elle says, "Oh, I think I know just the place," as they are driving by the White House.'] ['Three years after the previous movie, Marnie Piper prepares to begin a new school year in her new home. She asks the Halloweentown Witches\' Council to work toward openness between Halloweentown and the mortal world. She proposes to bring a group of Halloweentown students to her own high school in the mortal world. The Council is initially apprehensive about this, mostly due to the legend of the Knights of the Iron Dagger: a fanatical knighthood who wanted to destroy all things magical. The Council, however, agrees to accept the plan after Marnie mistakenly bets "all the Cromwell magic" that her plan will work . If she does not prove she is right by midnight on Halloween, then her entire family will lose their magical abilities. The Halloweentown students consisting of an unnamed witch, Ethan Dalloway, Jessica, Pete, Chester, Natalie, Nancy, Zachary, and Bobby arrive. They are magically given human appearances to disguise their true non-human natures. School begins with Marnie acting as tour guide for the exchange group ; Aggie substitute teaching so she can be available in case of need; Cody, a new student, showing a romantic interest in Marnie; and a possible threat to the school from the Knights of the Iron Dagger. She encourages the kids to join sports teams and clubs. While Aggie proves unable to teach any subject effectively , the Halloweentown students keep to themselves, hiding in the refuge that Aggie magically creates for them in a remote student locker. Marnie gradually encourages the kids to join school activities and make new friends. Marnie\'s progress is interrupted by a warning that appears to be from the Knights of the Iron Dagger, then by a magical incident at the mall that results in the Halloweentown students assuming their natural appearances, by a break-in at the secret magical locker, and finally by the disappearance of one of the students. Meanwhile, Marnie\'s developing relationship with Cody parallels an unexpected romance beginning between Aggie and the school\'s principal, Phil Flanagan. Aggie suspects Cody of being the cause of the trouble, and tries to convince Marnie to halt their relationship, but Marnie in turn suspects Flanagan. They eventually discover that Flanagan is the Knight in question; he was told prior to the students\' arrival that he was the last of the Order. Edgar Dalloway, head of the Witches\' Council and father of one of the students, is the real root of their problems. He wants to keep Halloweentown isolated from the mortal world, and used Flanagan to ensure the failure of Marnie\'s project. This, he hoped, would cause a negative reaction in Halloweentown and keep the portal between Halloweentown and the mortal world closed. The Halloweentown students use the school\'s Halloween carnival to improve mortal attitudes toward magical folk. Their haunted house depicts the ordinary lives of creatures that have typically been seen as monsters in the mortal world, including displays like the "Monster Tea Party" and ogres "picnicking in their natural setting", and winds up boring the carnival goers. Gwen meanwhile uses a witch\'s glass to hunt down the missing student whom Dalloway imprisons. At the school Halloween carnival, Edgar Dalloway launches magical attacks against mortal students by bringing the inanimate monsters in the haunted house to life. The ensuing damage and panic spiral beyond Marnie\'s and Aggie\'s ability to contain them, including a reanimated skeleton which grows 30 feet tall. Flanagan incites a mob to corner the Halloweentown students. Cody shames the crowd, the students reveal themselves, and the crowd accepts them for who they are. Flanagan also renounces being a knight and accepts Aggie. Dalloway claims the Cromwell magic, but Gwen, accepting her magic abilities, has shown the evening\'s events to the full Witches\' Council. They return the Cromwell magic, Gwen returns with the student whom Dalloway had imprisoned, and the Council imprisons Dalloway in another witches glass considering this his resignation . The portal between Halloweentown and the mortal world opens in the middle of the haunted house, and crowds of kids from Halloweentown cross over to enjoy the carnival together with mortal world kids. Marnie flies off for a romantic broom ride with Cody and, while flying over the carnival, they kiss.'] ['{{Plot}} Boston teenager Michael Dunn  and his young sister Boo  have been sent to Brooklyn to live with their Irish-Catholic grandparents (Kate Reid & [[Richard Hamilton  following the deaths of their parents. He is enrolled at St. Basil\'s, a strict Roman Catholic school and church, where his grandmother is determined to see him fulfill his parents\' dream of him joining the priesthood after graduation. The movie takes place during a time when the Catholic Church was changing its forms of discipline, liturgy, and sacraments. While some places had modified by then, St. Basil\'s held on to strict tradition, including Latin Mass. Dunn befriends Caesar , an over-weight, bespectacled student with a high voice and even higher grades and test scores. Caesar helps Dunn catch up with the rest of the class, but because of their association, foul-mouthed class bully and underachiever Ed Rooney  bullies Dunn with a prank outside of the soda fountain across the street from school. Not long after this confrontation, Dunn enters the classroom at the beginning of his English-Lit class just in time to see Rooney remove the screws from Caesar\'s desk. Minutes later, Cesar arrives, sits on the desk and falls to the floor. The teacher, Brother Constance  orders all the boys on their knees "until the joker comes forward". Dunn then whispers to Caesar that he tried to warn him, but his whisper is caught by Constance. He becomes convinced that Dunn knows the perpetrator. However, Dunn denies knowledge of Rooney\'s involvement, but Constance remains unconvinced. He calls Dunn to the front of the classroom, where he tries to get the prankster\'s name out of him by striking Dunn\'s open palms with a wooden paddle, which he has sadistically labeled with the word "PATIENCE". Fed up with Dunn\'s refusal to rat out Rooney, Constance shoves him towards the floor in the center of the classroom, ordering him to point the guilty party out. Dunn looks up at Rooney from the floor, who delivers a sly grin at him. Dunn lunges towards Rooney, taking him to the floor and the pair are separated by Constance and the novice friar, Brother Timothy ([[John Heard , who has been observing Constance\'s classroom teaching and discipline methods that day. Both are sent to headmaster Brother Thadeus\'  office. During a moment alone, Rooney, impressed by Dunn\'s refusal to snitch on him, attempts to patch things up between them, but Dunn wants nothing to do with him. Rooney tries again after class, but this time tells him that if they don\'t become friends, then he has to continue in his harassment in order to save face. Reluctantly, Dunn befriends Rooney, along with his friends Williams , a sexually frustrated kid who is frequently caught masturbating, and Corbett , the dull one of the bunch. Dunn also befriends Danni , a rebellious teenage high school drop-out tomboy who runs the soda fountain across from the school and takes care of her mentally infirm father . Looking for mischief by St. Basil\'s students, Danni\'s fountain shop is raided numerous times by the Brothers. After the raids, the fountain shop is always left a shambles. This last time, however, Dunn, who escapes detection, helps Danni clean things up, sparking a romance between the pair. Other hilarious episodes happen. At the sacrament of confession, Rooney looks at the lists of sins they all committed and has them swap them around so each list does not sound so bad. When Caesar enters the confessional, Father Abruzzi  becomes preoccupied with another student misbehaving in the church. At that point, Rooney goes into the priest\'s booth and acts as the priest hearing Caesar\'s confession, giving him the penance of befriending Rooney and making sure he gets Rooney passing grades. As a result, Caesar joins the four and befriends them while tutoring Rooney. Later in the movie, while the students are attending a St. Basil\'s school dance, Father Abruzzi gives a classic speech to the school along with the girls\' school nearby regarding the evils of the flesh and "lust" and how that will condemn them to hell. That night, after getting bored at the dance, Rooney and Janine , a student at the neighboring Virgin Martyr Girls Academy, drive Caesar and Janine\'s friend Kathleen  around Brooklyn and get Rooney\'s father\'s 1966 Lincoln Continental stuck on a drawbridge, which destroys the powertrain and most of the undercarriage. Later, Pope Paul VI visits New York City and St. Basil\'s school takes a field trip to Manhattan to see him ride in a parade. Brother Constance nearly tears up when he sees the Pope riding by. Meanwhile, the five friends sneak off to a nearby movie theatre, where they see Elvis Presley\'s "Blue Hawaii". After the movie, they are caught missing, and Brother Constance orders them to clean St. Basil\'s statue with toothbrushes on the school courtyard after Sunday Mass for punishment. The friendship between Dunn and Danni further develops, which one day culminates in a passionate kiss under the boardwalk on Coney Island in a rainstorm. One day, during one of the Brothers\' routine "raids", Danni takes a stand and locks them out. When they look into the windows and try to take names, she closes the blinds. The Brothers leave, but later at dinner, they discuss the episode at the soda fountain. At the urging of Brother Constance and gym teacher Brother Paul, and at the reluctance of Brothers Thaddeus and Timothy, they notify social services. A few days later, Dunn and his friends walk up to the fountain and find police cars and a few of the school\'s Brothers surrounding the door as Danni\'s father is led out of the front door in handcuffs. Fearing the worst, Dunn rushes in and finds that social workers are getting ready to take Danni away. A shaken Dunn takes Danni in his arms. Weeping, she wants him to promise he won\'t be sad over her departure. He watches helplessly as she\'s taken away in a car. Rooney, angry at the loss of his hangout and at the Brothers for ruining his friend\'s life, develops another prank with the help of Caesar, Williams and Corbett. The night before Easter recess, the boys sneak onto the grounds and decapitate the statue of St. Basil. During an assembly the next day, Rooney presents Dunn with a duffel bag containing the missing saint\'s head, right as Brother Thadeus is addressing the student body with the phrase "of what is ahead for you...". Brother Constance shows up, knowing he\'s found the vandals, and quietly orders them out of the assembly. Constance first locks them in a closet, where they discuss possible options. Moments later, they\'re retrieved by Brother William, who brings the quintet into the gym, where Constance has set up an exercise horse and a wide leather strap. He tells the boys that the guilty can confess now or all will suffer for it. Dunn, though innocent, speaks up. As Constance attempts to lead Dunn up to the horse, Rooney clears Dunn\'s name...but fingers Williams...who fingers Corbett...who fingers Caesar. Not willing to listen any further, Constance calls Corbett to the horse and delivers five blows from the strap to Corbett\'s rear. He repeats the same procedure with Williams, delivering six this time. When he comes to Caesar, he is presented with a laminated doctor\'s note, presumably to exempt him from corporal punishment. Constance says he\'ll return it to him after he\'s finished and orders him to the horse. Caesar pleads for mercy, but Constance drags the cowering Caesar on the floor, beating him with the strap while doing so. Unable to watch such brutality any longer, Dunn shoves Constance to the floor, ordering him to leave Caesar alone. Constance gets to his feet, and Dunn flees the gym with the Brother in pursuit. The other boys in turn run after Constance. The chase ends in the auditorium as Thadeus is concluding his remarks to the student body. Dunn rushes in, knocking over a series of music stands and chairs, followed by Constance, who tries to call him out. He then tries to take Dunn by force, but Dunn resists. Constance backhands him, shouting "Bastard!" as he does. As Constance tries to explain himself before Thadeus, Dunn sees that he\'s been cut on his cheek from Constance\'s ring. He jumps to his feet and delivers an uppercut to Constance, knocking him to the floor and causing pandemonium as the student body rises to its feet and cheers for Dunn. The boys are sent to the headmaster\'s office, where they are joined by Brothers Thadeus, Timothy and Constance. Constance tries to have all five expelled for assault while Timothy argues self-defense. Thadeus calls the boys in and asks for a reason not to expel them. Dunn, seeing a possible exit from the priesthood through his expulsion, accepts the blame and says he should be expelled. Thadeus counters by saying that since all acted as one, all shall bear the consequences. Dunn protests by saying he instigated the melee. Thadeus disagrees, saying he understands it was Constance who started it. Constance blanches at Thadeus\' remark. Not explaining anything further in front of the boys, Thadeus suspends all five for two weeks and sends them out of his office. Brother Dominic , Thadeus\' secretary, then comes into his office and hands him a document that he immediately signs as Constance tries unapologetically to defend himself. Thadeus hands Constance the signed document, which orders him transferred out of St. Basil\'s and to where he won\'t be working with children at all. Angry at what he perceives as betrayal, Constance declares that he will demand an investigation into the matter, taking it to the bishop if necessary. Thadeus, unmoved by Constance\'s remarks, orders him out of his office. Timothy is then offered Constance\'s job, which he immediately accepts. The film ends with the five main characters walking out of the school downtrodden after having been suspended, and then joyfully realizing they won\'t have to go to school for the next two weeks. A voice-over epilogue from Rooney states that everyone graduated in 1966 "except me". Corbett married Janine and they have six kids, Williams works as a projectionist at a Times Square porno theatre, Caesar graduated with honors from Queens College and went on to become a psychiatrist, Dunn  eventually was reunited with Danni at Woodstock. Rooney went to beauty school "where everybody graduated...except me", but became a shampoo boy at a Bensonhurst hair salon, where "the hours suck, the pay sucks, and I\'m surrounded by \'funny guys\', but the tips are great! Thank you, God!"'] ['The film begins in a police station. Several people, including high school senior Sue Snell and gym teacher Ms. Desjarden, are being interviewed by a detective about the disappearance of high school senior Carrie White. The film then flashes back to one week before the prom at Ewen High School. The popular girls at school constantly harass Carrie, with Chris Hargensen being especially vicious. After gym class, Carrie has her first period in the shower room and panics. The other girls swarm around the shower and taunt her. Hearing the commotion, Ms. Desjarden comes into the shower, and finds Carrie lying by the drain in a fetal position as the other girls hound her. As she comforts the terrified girl, Carrie asks her if she is dying, revealing she had no knowledge about menstruation and thought she was bleeding to death. Later, the school principal determines that Carrie should go home to calm down after the incident. When the principal repeatedly mispronounces her name, Carrie snaps and screams out her name. Suddenly, the principal\'s desk moves several inches in the opposite direction. While Carrie is getting her things, she discovers someone spray-painted "Plug it up" on her locker, and it\'s filled with tampons. On her way home, Carrie is accosted by a pre-teen boy on a bicycle. With no warning, his bike smashes into a tree, throwing the boy to the ground and breaking his arm. When she reaches home, Carrie\'s fanatically religious mother, Margaret White, receives the phone call from school. Margaret considers menstruation a sign of sexual sin, and locks Carrie in her "praying closet" as punishment. The next day, Ms. Desjarden notifies the girls that they are to have 50 minutes\' detention in the gym every day for a week for their bullying. If they skip the detention, they face three days\' suspension and banishment from the prom. Chris storms out in protest, but none of the other girls follow her. At the same time, Carrie researches "miracles" in the library to understand what has been happening to her. Eventually, she finds out about telekinesis, an unusual gift that enables the carriers to move or control objects with their minds. After Chris\' father John Hargensen, a lawyer, unsuccessfully attempts to get her prom ban rescinded, Chris enlists her boyfriend Billy Nolan to get revenge on Carrie. At the same time, Sue, trying to atone for tormenting Carrie in the locker room, asks her popular boyfriend Tommy Ross to take Carrie to the prom instead of her. After some hesitation, Carrie agrees. That evening, Carrie tells her mother about the prom invitation; Margaret flies into a rage and forbids her to go. Carrie uses her powers to finally confront her mother, and Margaret seemingly gives in. As prom approaches, Sue helps Carrie prepare for the big event. Chris and one of her cronies, Tina Blake, overhear their plans and plan revenge. Chris and Billy kill a pig at Irwin Hinti\'s farm and gather up its blood. On the day of the prom, Margaret begs Carrie to stay home and ask God for forgiveness, but Carrie uses her powers to throw her mother out of the room. Tommy comes to pick Carrie up for the prom on a limousine, impressed by her makeover into a beautiful young woman. As the prom progresses, more people begin to accept Carrie. Tina manages to switch the ballots for prom king and queen for fraudulent ones that declare Carrie and Tommy the winners. As Tommy and Carrie take their place on stage, Carrie notices something red dripping on her arm and looks up, seeing a bucket of pig\'s blood placed above the stage. Chris, who has been hiding with Billy backstage and has become extremely hesitant, pulls the rope, sending a wave of blood on Carrie, with some hitting Norma and Tommy. The duo run away, letting go of the rope. The bucket falls on Tommy\'s head, killing him. Carrie goes into a shock-induced trance, and loses control of her telekenesis. She locks everyone inside the gym and drops several spotlights on the floor. The sparks set the gym ablaze, causing a mass panic. As Tina screams in horror, Carrie crushes her to death with a basketball board. Ms. Desjarden manages to get a few kids into a vent, where they make their escape. Carrie opens up all the sprinklers, then causes the scoreboard to fall, electrocuting everyone else on the floor. Carrie leaves the burning gym, locking the doors behind her and leaving almost all of the students and staff to burn to death. As she makes her way back to town, she brings the destruction with her, nearly obliterating the adjoining neighborhoods. Chris and Billy, witnessing the destruction from Billy\'s truck, encounter Carrie. Billy attempts to run her over, all the while as Chris tries to stop him, but Carrie stops it and sends it slamming into a tree, killing them both. Once Carrie gets home, she takes a bath to wash off all the blood. She finally snaps back to herself, and doesn\'t appear to remember what happened. Margaret, now completely insane, calls Carrie a witch and attempts to drown her in the tub. Carrie begins to lose consciousness, but uses her last ounce of strength to mentally stop her mother\'s heart, killing her. During the disastrous aftermath of the prom, Sue goes out looking for Carrie and finds her near death in the bathtub with her mother\'s dead body nearby. Sue manages to revive Carrie with rescue breathing and hide her in the ruins of the school while the furor quiets down. About a week later, Sue agrees to sneak Carrie out of town to somewhere in Florida. As the two drive off into the rainy night, Carrie has a nightmarish vision of her mother, who warns her that "sin never dies". She wakes up and Sue asks her if she had a bad dream. When she looks at her she has transformed to Chris and lunges at her. Carrie wakes up from her nightmare and Sue asks her if she wants to stop for a moment. Carrie sighs, and tells Sue to keep driving.'] ['Set in the Dogtown area of Santa Monica in the early 1970s, surfers Tony Alva, Stacy Peralta, and Jay Adams enjoy the life of skating and surfing the pier with board designer Skip Engblom and the other locals. One day, Skip is given polyurethane wheels for the skateboards in his shop, Zephyr Skate Shop. Teenager Sid, a friend of the boys who works in the same shop, invites Tony, Jay, Stacy and the other locals to test the new wheels. They are all amazed as the polyurethane wheels allow the skateboards to make the same carves on flat ground as surf boards on the waves. After witnessing what Todd Levy from the Eastern Shore of Maryland could now do with the wheels, Skip decides to add to his already famous surf team, a skate team, the Z-Boys. The team proves to be a success; winning many contests, Stacy, Jay, and Tony gain popularity from locals across Venice. A period of hot weather reduces the surf at the pier and the official declaration of a drought means swimming pools cannot be filled with water.

Jay is offered $10,000 to appear in a commercial sponsoring the toy, Slinky. However, he refuses, as he has become a much harder person than before. Before long, things start going out of control; at a major skating championship that they all take part in, Tony gets into a fight with another skater in the middle of the stadium, and gets violently knocked out, hospitalizing him and temporarily halting his career. Jay leaves the company he had endorsed when they sacrifice quality for cheap materials. Stacy ends up winning the competition. Back in Venice, the pier that the Z-Boys use to surf around burns down, which affects them all. Jay shaves his hair and becomes a gang member. Skip, still selling surfboards in his shop, finally decides to settle down and continues his passion of sanding and creating surfboards, as well as solving his financial troubles by selling his shop and is seen singing "Maggie May". Sid\'s long-time equilibrium problem turns out to be caused by a brain tumor, and he undergoes surgery. Though Stacy, Tony, and Jay have all gone their separate ways, they all show up at the same time to visit Sid. Stacy reveals that he is leaving his company to start his own. Sid\'s father empties their pool for them to skate in. Stacy, Tony, and Jay skate the pool and bring Sid into the fun on his wheel chair, referencing all the good times they had before they became a skate team. Closing cards reveal that Tony Alva went on to be a very successful skater and skating\'s first world champion ; Stacy Peralta started Powell Peralta, a modern popular skating company that included a 14-year-old Tony Hawk as part of its team; and Jay, too, achieved the only kind of success at skating and surfing he really cared about, becoming known as the \'spark that started the flame\'.

Though Nikko is skeptical and condescendingly rejects her offer, Courtney begs him to come to a carnival to see the choir perform and then make his decision. The next day at the carnival, Nikko arrives in time to see the Spectacular! show choir perform "Eye of the Tiger". Afterward, the ever-anxious Courtney once again attempts to persuade Nikko, who is less than impressed by the group\'s performance and style, to join the show choir and help them win a national contest, even offering him half the group\'s earnings from the contest in exchange for his consent. Nikko declines to join the group, stating that he isn\'t interested in choir. Soon, another show choir named Ta-da performs "Things We Do for Love". The lead singers are Royce , who used to be the lead singer for Spectacular! but quit after breaking up with Courtney, and Tammi , Royce\'s new girlfriend that is a snobby, selfish girl. Later on, Nikko meets with and performs for a famous music producer named Mr. Dickenson, who informs him that he has a shot at getting a record deal if he can raise enough money for equipment for his demo, which has to be excellent. Nikko recalls Courtney\'s offer of half the earnings from the contest Spectacular! plans to perform in, and decides to join the choir in order to get the money to pay for his demo. When he approaches the choir Courtney remembers his mockery of their carnival performance and initially refuses to let him join, but acquisces after Nikko demonstrates his talent by performing "Break My Heart" in front of the whole group, who are impressed by his vocals. When they are practicing, however, Nikko finds out that dancing for show choir is not as easy as it looks and cannot easily pick up the dance routines. Nikko, who lives with his older brother Stavros , does not inform his brother that he has joined show choir or that he is attempting to get a record deal because he knows Stavros would not approve. Several days later the group, dressed in hideous cowboy costumes, goes to perform at the club Nikko and his old band, Flux, had performed at in the beginning of the movie. There Nikko runs into his old band members, leading to an awkward confrontation and a lot of mockery from SLaughtered Brains. Meanwhile, Ta-da, who are also at the club, performs their song "Lonely Love Song". Nikko discovers from the other Spectacular! members that Royce is Courtney\'s ex-boyfriend. Upon witnessing Ta-da\'s good performance and the snobby attitudes of Tammi and Royce, Nikko becomes determined to help Spectacular! win the upcoming competition and begins to think that the group should come up with new dance moves and new music. One day, before Courtney arrives for choir practice, Nikko encourages the other choir members to try things a different way, and performs "Your Own Way", persuading the others to join in. Though they are initially reluctant to go against Courtney\'s wishes, the rest of the group eventually agree that they need a new routine in order to win the competition. They later meet up at Nikko\'s house, unbeknown to Courtney, and Nikko begins to teach them new dance moves, stating that if they perform the song in front of Courtney she would be impressed and may agree to change the group\'s style. The choir assembles at Nikko\'s house every night to practice while still attending practices with Courtney every afternoon. Nikko learns of Spectacular!{{\'}}s tradition of gathering for a bowling night the week before a competition. Only four members, including Nikko and Courtney, show up at the bowling alley, where they discover that Tammi and Royce are already bowling in their lane. After a brief confrontation between the two groups, Nikko persuades the others to perform a song using "Rock The World," a spoof of the real-life video game Rock Band. Random selection chooses a song called "For the First Time", which was Courtney and Royce\'s old duet. She and Nikko sing it, much to Royce\'s jealousy, and Nikko and Courtney are becoming attracted to each other. Nikko invites Courtney over to his house for a surprise, and when they get there the whole group has assembled on Nikko\'s rooftop, where they all perform "Your Own Way" for Courtney. Courtney, instead of being impressed, is upset, accusing Nikko to have betrayed her by practicing another routine behind her back,and then leaves. Later that night, Nikko goes to Courtney\'s house to apologize and almost has a fistfight with Royce, who has come to ask Courtney to get back together with him. Courtney rejects Royce, who tauntingly tells Nikko that Ta-Da will beat Spectacular! at the competition in the "weirdest trash talk that [Nikko\'s] ever heard." After Royce leaves, Nikko apologizes to Courtney for taking control of the group behind her back and offers to do things her way, but Courtney admits that the group needs a change. Courtney\'s mother tells Nikko that he can bring some good and change to the "Spectacular!" group and that Courtney will know how far they are actually able to push the envelope to win. The two of them decide to combine their talents and perform a song that everyone can agree upon, and Mr. Romano , their music teacher, suggests a song called "Something to Believe In". Spectacular! begins intense rehearsals and all seems well , until Mr. Dickinson pays Nikko and Stavros a visit and informs them that his boss is offering Nikko and Flux a record deal after an audition and will only be available on Saturday night. Knowing that Spectacular! is scheduled to perform at the concert on Saturday night, Nikko is torn between his commitment to the choir and his one shot at getting a record deal. He tries to inform Courtney of his decision to audition for the record deal, but cannot bring himself to do it. Meanwhile, Amy informs Stavros that Nikko has joined choir and Stavros confronts Nikko in front of the members of Spectacular!, insisting that Nikko drop out of choir and audition for the record deal instead. The other members of Spectacular! are upset at Nikko for bailing on them at the last minute, and Courtney feels that Nikko has betrayed her again. Mr. Romano visits Nikko, who is having a tough time deciding what to do, at his house and reveals that he was once in a famous band as Joey Rome that could have been more successful if he hadn\'t flopped and broke his contract due to his fear of taking risks. Before leaving to go audition for the record deal, Courtney shows up. Nikko fears that she is mad at him for turning his back on "Spectacular!" but instead she kisses him on the cheek and wishes him luck. On concert night, Ta-Da performs "On The Wings Of A Dream" and earns much applause and acclaim from the audience. Meanwhile, Nikko and Slaughtered Brains perform at their audition for the record deal, but Nikko\'s heart is not in it and the producers notice and tell him they are not interested; Stavros says that Nikko is just warming up, and that he is better than what he is giving out. Nikko begs them to let him show where his "heart is." When it is Spectacular!s turn to sing "Something to Believe In" at the national competition, Nikko, much to Courtney\'s surprise and delight, arrives onstage right before the chorus, belting out a long note. Flux joins him, playing background music, and Mr. Romano reprises his dream as a rock star by playing a guitar during the song. Nikko and Courtney reconcile, and the group earns a standing ovation. Ta-Da is announced as the winner of the contest and Spectacular! is disqualified because Nikko and Flux were performing as unregistered members of the act. Tammi reveals to Royce that she had only used him to win the contest and breaks up with him. Even though Spectacular! lost the contest, Nikko\'s amazing performance got him the record deal. After everyone leaves, Nikko and Courtney share a kiss. It ends with Spectacular!, Slaughtered Brains, and Mr. Romano in a studio together recording a song, suitably named "Everything Can Change", with Nikko and Courtney as the lead singers in the song.'] ['A ruthless and greedy talent manager named Boojie Baker  "discovers" and then exploits unknown rock bands. The film opens in a nightclub with one of Boojie Baker\'s protégé acts, a band named Charlie, who have clearly been put through the grind already. They begin griping about the royalties they\'ve been fleeced out of, and then walk out on him. Undaunted, Boojie and his loyal but dim-witted assistant Gordy  walk into a local bar for some cheap drinks and they discover a new band performing, played by real-life Chicago garage rock band The Faded Blue. Promising them a recording contract and ensuing fame, Boojie renames the five-man group "The Big Blast", outfits them in designer suits and sets about to prime them for stardom. This is done by utilizing a bevy of attractive and loose women to seduce a recording engineer, photographing him in the heat of the moment and then blackmailing him into letting The Big Blast cut a single. The group cuts their big hit, and Boojie presumably uses similar tactics to promote the record and garner airplay. However, it doesn\'t take long before the band begins to wonder why they aren\'t receiving any money for their labors. A hard line negotiator, Boojie refuses to budge in that respect, and welcomes the boys to seek fame in fortune in other avenues. To show there are no hard feelings, he even invites them to a party at his apartment. It turns out that this party, replete with liquor, women and marijuana is a setup, and a "police detective" shows up to raid it. Coincidentally, this is before Boojie arrives, and when he does, it seems that he also has some pull in the "police department". As it happens, he is able to bail the boys out of this serious legal jam; if they agree to sign new contracts. One by one, each of the five members concedes to Boojie\'s demands. Incidentally, after they leave, the "detective" hits up Boojie for some of the grass. Back in the studio, the group begins to unravel, internal bickering starts to swell and they just can\'t seem to cut their follow-up hit. In the climax, the group decides instead to bring down Boojie at the expense of their own fame and fortune by sabotaging a television appearance Boojie has lined up by showing up drunk and singing a thinly-disguised musical flipping-of-the-bird to him. Having humiliated Boojie, the group then rips up Boojie\'s contract to them. Angry and defeated, Boojie and Gordy storm out of the studio, presumably to go look for another rock and roll band to manage and manipulate thus starting the cycle all over again. "Oh well, that\'s show business", one band member says. The film ends with a zany MOS montage of the band running around various Chicago landmarks, which was inspired by the comic stylings of Richard Lester\'s films.{{citation needed}}'] ["The film starts during a basketball game.

As they drive through Texas, they spot a distraught hitchhiker , who eventually gets into their van. After they have tried to speak to the hitchhiker, who talks incoherently about "a bad man", she shoots herself in the mouth with a .357 Magnum. After the startling shock, the group tries to contact the police, they then go to a store where a woman  tells them the sheriff is at the mill. Instead of the sheriff, they find a little boy named Jedediah  who tells them that the sheriff is at home drinking. Erin and Kemper go through the woods to find his house, leaving the other three at the mill with the boy. They come to a plantation house where Erin is allowed inside by the owner, an amputee named Monty, to phone for help. When Erin finishes, the old man asks her for help. Kemper goes inside to look for Erin and is attacked by the vicious-looking Leatherface , who hits him with a sledgehammer. When Leatherface takes Kemper\'s body to begin to make a new mask out of him, he discovers a small black box from Kemper. Opening it, he discovers a ring. Kemper was intending to propose to Erin. Meanwhile, Sheriff Hoyt  arrives at the mill and disposes of the hitchhiker\'s body, wrapping her in cellophane and putting her in his trunk. As he drives away, he tells the youths to leave. Erin arrives and finds that Kemper is still missing. Andy and Erin go back to the Monty\'s house, where Erin distracts him while Andy searches for Kemper. Monty realizes Andy is inside and summons Leatherface, who attacks Andy with his chainsaw. Erin escapes and heads towards the woods, but Leatherface slices Andy\'s leg off. Leatherface carries him to the basement and hangs him on a meat hook with his feet hanging over a piano, where he rubs salt on Andy\'s stump of a leg before wrapping it in butcher paper and tying it with human hair. Erin makes it to the mill and tries to escape in the van, but the sheriff shows up and, after spotting marijuana on the dashboard, orders Erin, Morgan and Pepper to get out of the van. The sheriff gives Morgan the gun he took from the hitchhiker and tells Morgan to reenact how she killed herself. Morgan, scared and disturbed by the sheriff\'s demeanor, and under pressure by Erin and Pepper, attempts to shoot the sheriff only to find the gun is unloaded. Sheriff Hoyt handcuffs Morgan and drives him to the Hewitt house , leaving the girls in the van. Erin tries to fix the truck, while Pepper holds a flashlight. Erin gets the truck running and begins to drive, but one of the wheels falls off. Erin and Pepper stay still in the truck, but Leatherface appears on the top of the truck and tries to attack them by chainsawing the roof. After witnessing Pepper\'s murder by Leatherface, Erin, who sees that Leatherface is wearing Kemper\'s face over his own, runs to escape and hides in a nearby trailer with two women inside, who offer her tea and try to soothe her. The two women, an obese middle-aged woman known only as the \'Tea Lady\' and a younger woman named Henrietta, who is presumably her daughter, act strangely. After they tell Erin they don\'t have a phone for her to call for help, a telephone in the trailer rings and Henrietta picks it up and tells someone on the other end "she\'s here". Erin discovers they have kidnapped a child when she sees that the baby with them is the same child in a photograph with the woman who committed suicide earlier. However, the tea is drugged and she passes out when she tries to leave the trailer. Erin wakes up at the Hewitt house surrounded by the Hewitt family: Leatherface, his mother Luda May, Sheriff Hoyt, Uncle Monty, and the little boy Jedediah. Luda May tells Erin that her excuse for her son Thomas\' actions is that her son was tormented by teenagers and that she felt no one cared for her family besides themselves. Erin is taken to the basement, where she finds Andy. She tries to help him off of the meat hook but when he sees he will land on the piano keys and alert Leatherface, he begs her to kill him, which she does, though suffering severe emotional trauma. Afterwards, she finds Morgan, who is still handcuffed. Jedediah, who clearly does not agree with the actions of his family, leads them out of the house. Jedediah rejects Erin\'s plea to come with them, rather staying there, and distracts Leatherface long enough for them to escape. Erin and Morgan find an abandoned house in the woods and barricade themselves inside. Leatherface breaks in and discovers Erin, but Morgan attacks Leatherface, causing him to drop his chainsaw. Morgan grabs him and wrestles him, but Leatherface is a large, powerful man who easily lifts Morgan upwards toward a chandelier, where Morgan becomes entangled by his handcuffs, and is left hanging and defenseless. Leatherface picks up his chainsaw, slicing up into Morgan\'s crotch and killing him. Erin runs out of the shack and escapes through the woods. Leatherface trips on a fence and cuts his leg while pursuing her. Erin finds a slaughterhouse and hides in a locker. Leatherface opens the locker across from hers and she attacks him with a meat cleaver, chopping off his right arm. Erin runs outside and flags down a trucker, whom she tries to convince to go away from the Hewitt\'s house. But he stops to find help at the eatery. Erin sees Luda May and watches as Sheriff Hoyt arrives and talks to the trucker. Erin sees Henrietta watching over the kidnapped baby in a highchair. When Henrietta walks outside to join Luda May and Sheriff Hoyt, who are talking to the truck driver, Erin sneaks the baby out of the eatery and places her in the sheriff\'s car and hot-wires it. Hoyt notices her and tries to stop her, but she runs him down and runs him over repeatedly until he is dead. Leatherface appears in the road with the chainsaw and tries to stop her, but he is too slow, and Erin manages to escape with the baby unharmed.'] ["Price plays the titular mad scientist who, with the questionable assistance of his resurrected flunky Mullaney, builds a gang of female robots who are then dispatched to seduce and rob wealthy men.

His gifts do not extend to grades, however, and he receives rejection letters from all of the universities and colleges to which he applies, including those with high acceptance rates. In an attempt to seek approval from his strict father , Bartleby creates a fake college, the South Harmon Institute of Technology . He is aided by his best friend, Sherman Schrader III , who wears Brooks Brothers shirts and has been accepted into the prestigious Harmon College, and fellow rejects Rory , a hard-working girl who, due to prevalence of nepotism, failed to get in to Yale University, the only school she applied to, Hands , who lost his athletic scholarship after an injury, and Glen , who got a "0" on the SAT when he neglected to sign his name. To make the "college" seem legitimate, Bartleby convinces Sherman to create a fully functional Web site for the school. When his domineering father insists on meeting the dean, Bartleby hires Schrader\'s uncle, Ben Lewis , to play that role, and he also leases an abandoned psychiatric hospital adjacent to Harmon College and renovates it to look like a college campus. The seemingly innocent ploy quickly spins out of control when the Web site, which automatically accepts any applicant, enrolls hundreds of other rejected students. Bartleby realizes that these people have nowhere else to go, so he lets them believe that the school is real, a place where they will finally feel accepted. After a visit to Harmon disenchants him with traditional college life, he has the students make up their own classes and be their own teachers. Students write down what they want to learn on a giant whiteboard, with classes ranging from the culinary arts and sculpting to "Taking a Walk and Thinking about Stuff," "Foreign Affairs: Hooking Up Overseas," "Rock Our Faces Off 222," and the invention of one freaky kid ([[Jeremy Howard  who wants to learn how to "blow shit up...with my mind." Bartleby even goes so far as to create a school newspaper  and a mascot . Meanwhile, the dean of nearby Harmon College, Richard Van Horne , makes plans to construct the Van Horne Gateway, an adjacent park-like "verdant buffer zone" by which the dean hopes "to keep knowledge in, and ignorance out." He dispatches Hoyt Ambrose  to free up the nearby properties, but when Bartleby refuses to relinquish the lease for the South Harmon property, Hoyt sets to work trying to reveal the college as a fake. The dispute turns personal, since Bartleby has been vying for the affections of Hoyt\'s ex-girlfriend, Monica Moreland . Hoyt exposes South Harmon as a fake institution through Sherman, who is attempting to join Hoyt\'s fraternity as a legacy, but is treated with humilation and abuse by his fraternity brothers. After having Sherman beaten up, Hoyt forces him to hand over all the files he has created for South Harmon. He then contacts all the students\' parents to expose the school as a fake. Soon after, the Institute is shut down, but Sherman\'s having taken the initiative to file for accreditation gives Bartleby a chance to make his school legitimate. At the State of Ohio educational accreditation hearing, Bartleby makes an impassioned speech about the failures of conventional education and the importance of following one\'s own passions instead of being dictated on what to do, convincing the board to grant his school a one-year probation to test his new system. The Institute reopens, with more students enrolling, including Sherman and Monica. Also, Bartleby finally earns the approval of his father, who is proud that his son actually owns a college. As the film closes, Van Horne is seen walking to his car in the Harmon College parking lot, only to watch it suddenly explode. The "mind-blowing" freak from earlier in the film is revealed as the culprit.'] ['Five children crawl from the wreckage of a deadly van accident in a snowy canyon.

They quickly begin arguing in front of a statue of the ancient Aztec god Tezcatlipoca.{{cite web}} As they argue, the statue casts a spell upon them — causing them to wake up in each other\'s bodies the next morning. When they arrive at school, they immediately blame each other for the body swap, but agree to pretend to be the other person until they can find a way to switch back.

Jezelle warns that one of them will die a horrible death, while the song "Jeepers Creepers" plays on a phonograph in the background. Darry demands to know which one of them, and she looks to Trish. The three are then discovered by the Creeper, and are separated. The Creeper heads towards Jezelle and sniffs her intently, but lets her go, and heads off to find Trish and Darry. After a lengthy chase, the Creeper corners both Trish and Darry in an upstairs room. After sniffing  them, the Creeper throws Trish aside and chooses Darry. Trish tries to reason with it, and offers to give her life for her brother\'s. The police burst in and take aim, but the Creeper escapes out the window, flying away with Darry. The next day, Trish, contemplating Darry\'s fate, is picked up by her parents, and Jezelle returns home in regret. The final scene shows the Creeper in its new hideout, an abandoned factory, where the audience finally learns what the Creeper wanted: by ripping out the back of Darry\'s head, it has taken his eyes, leaving Darry\'s body an eyeless, motionless corpse, while "Jeepers Creepers" is playing in the background. The film ends with Creeper looking at the audience through Darry\'s eye socket, now with Darry\'s brown eyes.

Morgan learns some valuable, hard lessons, and finds out how far he is really willing to go for Frankie\'s love. Ultimately, Morgan must face Nick and his gang to test the bounds of his honor, and his love for Frankie. The film begins at night with Morgan exploring the streets of his new neighborhood on his bicycle. The intro sequence features the song "Love Hates" programmed by Jonathan Elias and featuring vocals by Marianne Faithfull. It\'s a great electronic track with a dark edge, similar in vein to early Ministry  and sets the scene perfectly for the rest of the film; with small sequences of this song ocourring throughout the movie. On a local street in Reseda, CA, Frankie flirts with a business man waiting at a bus stop. She asks the man for change, and he pulls out a money clip full of cash to oblige. As they make small talk, Nick and his gang who\'ve been loitering at a nearby news stand; move in to mug the man. While the mugging is taking place, Morgan rides straight through the middle of it on his bicycle and foils the robbery by snatching a beer from one of the gang members. Morgan shakes it up and sprays beer on another gang member, who then sprays Nick in the face with spray paint; allowing the victim to escape. One final gang member manages to slash Morgan\'s jacket with a car antenna, but Morgan escapes into the night. The next day is the first day at a new school for Morgan. Upon leaving for school on his bike, Morgan has a chat with his father; who has just returned from a long night of work as a cab driver. At school, Morgan is quickly chastised by the school security guard, for riding his bike on campus. Nick notices Morgan as they loiter in the school parking lot before classes begin. Nick tells his gang, "I think we\'re going to school today." Morgan goes to the principal\'s office to register, and the principal asks Morgan what he plans on doing with his exceptional writing skills. Morgan says he doesn\'t know, and the principal informs Morgan that he won\'t put up with any of his prep-school parties; and roof top concerts he\'s conducted in the past. Jimmy Parker, a drummer in a local new wave/post punk band "The Crypt", has already caught word of Nick\'s intention to get back at Morgan for interfering in his business the night before. Jimmy asks his friend Feather for her blade. She says "Why? You\'re never gonna use it." He replies "Come on, maybe I wanna clean my teeth." She hands over her switchblade, and Jimmy quickly conceals it and heads off to class. In history class, the students are shown gunfighting clips from old westerns. Jimmy is seated behind Morgan and inadvertently opens up the switch blade, startling Morgan. Jimmy then tells Morgan to take it, because it\'s all over the school about him and Nick Hauser.

The Camaro stops right in front of Morgan and a gang member sprays Morgan in the face with red spray paint. Luckily, Morgan is wearing sunglasses. Nick asks the crowd of students if he should give Morgan his bike back. Nick lays the bike down, and Morgan picks it up. But before Morgan can leave, one gang member drives his car straight at Morgan in a game of chicken. All Morgan can do is squeeze the hand brake on his bike as the car hits the front wheel of his 10 speed, hurling it into the air. When the bike hits the pavement it\'s mangled and broken. Nick says he\'s sorry as Morgan carries his bike away on his shoulder. Back at home, Morgan argues with his mother after she walks into his room and sees his mangled bike. His mother asks if they had insurance and reminds him that the bike cost $500.00 She asks him if it is "happening again." Morgan\'s father comes in and asks him if the bike can be fixed. Frustrated, Morgan leaves for the warehouse to go see Jimmy\'s band. While on his walk to the warehouse he sees a Porsche 911 convertible, with the keys in the ignition. At the warehouse, The Crypt  is performing, and the warehouse is filled with teenagers dancing and having a good time.  When Morgan sees Frankie talking with a friend in between a song, he quickly grabs her and they rush into the crowd. Morgan repetedly asks what her name is. Frankie refuses to say, and asks to be let go. Morgan is persistent though, and each time Frankie tries to run away she somehow ends up back in Morgan\'s arms. Nick and his gang show up at the warehouse, and see Frankie dancing with Morgan. Nick tells his goons to get Morgan, but each time they get close to Morgan he spins them around and throws them to the floor. After the song is over, Nick instructs Frankie that the dance is over and tells her friend Ronnie to take her home. Morgan runs after Frankie but only sees her friends driving her away.

After school, Morgan is waiting at a bus stop and sees Nick\'s Camaro. He runs on foot, and the Camaro gives chase. Morgan runs down an alley where he is trapped. He tries to jump a fence but falls to the ground. Much to his surprise it is Jimmy who is driving the Camaro. He explains that Nick\'s bro called his bro, and Jimmy got the car. Morgan and Jimmy cruise the streets and Jimmy explains that his brother was in a gang, and he was barred from ever being in one. Jimmy tosses some of Nick\'s cassettes out the window. They spot Frankie, Ronnie, and Feather at a local burger joint and pull over. Thinking Nick is out of Jail, Frankie grabs Ronnie and runs to the car to get in. To their surprise it\'s Morgan and Jimmy. Frankie is not happy about the trickery, while Ronnie exclaims "Thank You God" because she has a huge crush on Jimmy. They drive around L.A. for a while, through Beverly Hills and sneak into a country club party to have lunch. When the cover band takes a break, Morgan plays piano and sings Frankie a song. Later that night, Frankie takes Morgan to a local club where Jack Mack and the Heart Attack are playing and she shows off her dancing skills. When Nick finds out about the night on the town, he has his goons attack Morgan at school the next day in the locker room.

That night, Nick bursts into Frankie\'s room with Frankie\'s father and a bottle of champagne and exclaims that she has said yes to marry him. Her father is happy, but doesn\'t know that she never said actually said yes; this is all Nick\'s controlling way to try and keep a hold on Frankie. Frankie had already promised to have dinner at Morgan\'s house, and meet his parents. She keeps her commitment, but the dinner goes bad when Morgan\'s mom asks about Frankie\'s mom, who is deceased. Frankie leaves despite Morgan\'s pleas that his mother didn\'t know. Nick and his goons then find Frankie walking down the street and decide to drink it up and cruise the streets all night. Nick sees Morgan\'s dad looking at a map on the hood of his cab, and lies about being out of gas. He hands Frankie his watch and tells her to ask the cab driver for some money for the watch. But after realizing it\'s Morgan\'s father, she gets back in the car and tells Nick she can\'t do it. Nick asks why and says, "It\'s because that\'s Hiller\'s father over there isn\'t it?" and "Maybe you should have thought about that before you got involved with him." Frankie runs over to Morgan\'s father and tells him to go, but it\'s too late and Nick\'s gang attacks Morgan\'s father. Morgan\'s father beats them down one by one, and even punches Nick. But Nick pulls a gun and shoots Morgan\'s father. Nick and the gang flee, leaving Frankie there with Morgan\'s wounded father on the sidewalk. Morgan meets Frankie at the hospital when he comes to see his dad. She breaks down in his arms, and they go back to Morgan\'s house. They make love as the sun comes up in Morgan\'s room. Later that day, Nick comes into Frankie\'s father\'s liquor store. Nick beats up Frankie\'s father, and makes Frankie call Morgan. Nick tells Morgan to meet him at the warehouse. Morgan goes to Jimmy\'s house to try and get help. Jimmy is not home, so Morgan leaves a note with Jimmy\'s brother. Morgan sneaks into the warehouse and slowly takes out Nick\'s gang one by one.

When he finally catches her, she awakens screaming in her own bed. However her nightgown has four slashes in it, identical to the ones given to her in the dream by the unknown man\'s razors, and is less than convinced it was just a nightmare. The next day, Nancy Thompson  recalls a nursery rhyme from Tina\'s description when they meet up with Nancy\'s boyfriend, Glen Lantz . Tina\'s boyfriend Rod Lane  shows up as well. Nancy admits she also had a bad dream and all of them dismiss the topic of the nightmare, though Tina is visibly disturbed. That night, Nancy and Glen go to Tina\'s house because her mother is out of town and Tina is still troubled by her nightmare. Tina describes the killer in her dream, which intrigues Nancy who adds to the description having seen the same killer herself, also getting Glen\'s silent attention. Rod crashes the party and he and Tina have sex while Glen and Nancy sleep in adjoining rooms. Rod also tells Tina he\'s been having nightmares, but neither of them think about it and go to sleep. Once asleep, Tina is once again stalked by the hideous figure, who taunts her repeatedly before attacking. This time, he catches and murders her. Her struggles awaken Rod who watches Tina get slashed by the glove and dragged up the wall and across the ceiling, screaming his name and alerting the others before she falls dead onto the bed. Because Rod was the only one in the same room as Tina, he is suspected of the murder and is arrested the next day. While at school, Nancy has a terrifying nightmare in class where she is attacked by the same figure that killed Tina. Nancy leaves the school early and goes to the jail to talk to Rod, who describes what he saw the night Tina was killed, which reminded him of his own nightmares where he was also stalked by the figure wearing the glove. To her shock, Nancy realizes that Rod did not kill Tina and leaves. Later, she begs Glen to watch her while she sleeps so she can investigate her dreams further. Glen hesitates, but accepts. When Nancy goes to sleep, she sees the killer enter Rod\'s jail cell and suspects that Rod is in danger. When she wakes up, she and Glen rush to the police station only to find Rod dead, hung by his own bed sheets. Everybody, except Nancy, believes that he committed suicide. At Rod\'s funeral, Nancy\'s mother, Marge Thompson  insists on getting her psychiatric help. But while at the clinic to evaluate her dreams, she has a violent encounter and awakens with a streak of white in her hair. Much to her horror, she also pulls the killer\'s battered hat out of the dream with her, which she recognizes. Marge begins to drink heavily and installs security bars on all the windows and the door. She reveals to Nancy that the owner of the hat and the burned figure from her nightmares is a man named Freddy Krueger . Years ago, he was arrested after murdering 20 children, but due to a technicality , he was released. Soon after, the enraged parents of the murdered children took the law into their hands by burning Freddy alive. It now appears that he is exacting revenge against the parents that killed him from beyond the grave by killing their children from within their dreams. Nancy tells this to Glen, who advises her to turn her back on her fear and to take the energy of the killer away from him, but she plans to pull Freddy from the dreamworld where she and Glen can gang up on him and surrender him to the authorities. However, both Glen and Nancy\'s parents lock them inside their respective houses, keeping them from meeting. Glen later falls asleep and is killed when Freddy pulls him into his bed and he is regurgitated as a geyser of blood. Nancy then receives a phone call from Freddy, who tells her: "I\'m your boyfriend now, Nancy.", indicating that he has killed Glen.

Nancy proves to be a match for him, setting up several booby traps and making him fall into every one, then lighting him on fire and trapping him in the basement to call her father. Don and his department arrive to put out the fires. He and Nancy then follow a trail of footsteps up to Marge\'s room and discover Freddy smothering her with his flaming body. They knock him out but he disappears, leaving the body of Marge Thompson vanishing slowly into the bed. Nancy sends her father from the room and turns her back as Freddy rises from the bed. She proclaims she is no longer afraid of him, causing him to lose his powers. Freddy lunges forward as she walks out of the room and vanishes. Nancy steps out into daylight from her front door and her mother appears well and sober, promising to stop drinking as her friends pull up in Glen\'s car.

After some drug use, video games, and sex between Donny, Heather, and Ali, the wayward teens make their first attempt, centered on luring Bobby into another sexual encounter with Ali. The idea is for Ali to shoot him during the encounter, but she backs out and passes the gun to Lisa, who is hiding in the room, while Bobby is distracted. While Ali and Bobby are having sex, Lisa takes out the gun and aims at Bobby\'s head, but she backs out when she realizes that the gun can be traced back to them because it belongs to her mother. This failed attempt does not dampen Lisa\'s determination, as she repeatedly tells the others that she wants Bobby dead. Realizing they need help, they hire a supposed "hitman" . The "hitman" refuses to help because he believes their plan will backfire easily; he says if they can come up with a better plan, he will assist them. As the story progresses, it becomes comically apparent that the "hitman" is just a tough-talking adolescent. Initially, much of the group dismisses the entire idea as a lark, but because Lisa is so adamant, eventually they all decide to go through with it. They come up with another plan - luring Bobby to a canal, where they plan to kill him. They go to the hitman with the new plan; when he asks for justification, Ali and Lisa tell him that Bobby raped them, and they relay details about his mistreatment of Marty. The hitman agrees someone like that deserves to die and says he will help them. Derek initially thinks they are simply going to size Bobby up, but Lisa makes it clear to him that she plans to see Bobby dead. It becomes apparent that while Lisa, Marty and the hitman are serious about carrying out the murder, the other teenagers are indifferent. As the teenagers arrive at the swamp, the hitman tells them what to do: Ali is to coax Bobby near the edge of the swamp away from the group. If Bobby does not suspect any trouble, Heather is to give the group a signal by going up to them and asking if there are any alligators in the canal. Donny and Marty are then supposed to attack Bobby when they hear Heather\'s signal. Lisa, Derek, and the hitman are waiting nearby to make sure Bobby does not escape. After the plan is set, Heather goes up to Ali and Bobby, and nervously asks about alligators in the canal. Bobby sarcastically tells her to go skinny-dipping to find out. After Heather mentions alligators again, Donny runs up behind Bobby and stabs him in the back of the neck. Shocked by the realness of the violence, Ali, Heather, and Derek run back to Ali\'s car, with Heather panicking in the backseat. When Bobby calls to Marty for help, Marty responds by running up and stabbing him in the abdomen. Bobby pleads with Marty, begging him for forgiveness shortly before Donny stabs him multiple times. Bobby tries to escape, but falls in front of Ali\'s car, where Marty finishes him by slitting his throat, followed by the hitman bludgeoning him with a baseball bat. Lisa witnesses it all, shocked but never turning away. Finally, the hitman drags Derek out of the car and demands his assistance in dumping the body in the swamp, to which he reluctantly agrees. They are shocked when Bobby flinches; they still decide to dump him in the canal, believing his wounds are fatal and that alligators will destroy any evidence. Ali, Heather, and Derek plan on going home, but the hitman stops them, stating they have to plan their alibi, and they drive to North Beach to talk it over. At the beach, Marty realizes he left his knife sheath at the canal, and the hitman states they have to go back anyway because they forgot to cover the tire marks on the sand. Marty, the hitman, and Ali go to retrieve the sheath, and while there they check up on the corpse, which is now being eaten by crabs. The three then rejoin the others at North Beach. The hitman says Marty will be the first suspect since he is Bobby\'s best friend. Everyone is aware that there are serious consequences for what they\'ve done; however Lisa, Derek, Ali, and Heather do not believe they did anything wrong since they did not directly participate in Bobby\'s actual death. The hitman threatens to murder anyone who reports details of the crime to the police. Their commitment eventually unravels, however, as Derek and then Lisa reveal what they\'ve done to others, while Ali phones in an anonymous tip, alerting the media to Bobby\'s death. Lisa calls Marty to tell him that people know Bobby is dead; he becomes upset and accuses Lisa of telling someone about what happened, although Lisa falsely insists she didn\'t. Lisa accuses Ali of ratting them out and tells her they have to hide, but Ali refuses. Lisa\'s mother overhears this conversation. The hitman then sees a news story about Bobby\'s death and realizes someone talked. Ali hides out in her house; due to her hysteria, her parents do not believe her when she says she\'s been involved in a murder. Lisa eventually calls the hitman and speaks to his younger brother, who says the hitman, whose real name is Derek Kaufman, is not a hitman at all. He tells Lisa that his brother has already been arrested for the murder, and suggests that Lisa and her friends turn themselves in. Eventually, all the teenagers do just that, with the exception of Marty. A few evenings later, police officers show up at Marty\'s home; he is asleep when they come into his room to arrest him. We later see the group in court wearing prison jumpsuits; Lisa is visibly pregnant by this time. When Heather asks if Lisa will even be let out to have the baby, an argument ensues and Marty reveals that his lawyer told him that Heather and Derek ratted them all out to lighten their sentences. When the hitman, knowing what Marty\'s talking about, begins to threaten Derek, Lisa tells him to back off. When Donny says he didn\'t do anything, Marty reminds him that he stabbed Bobby. Marty and Donny begin to argue, with the entire court taking notice as they inadvertently admit during the argument that they are responsible for Bobby\'s death. At the end of the film, subtitles show the prison sentences that the teenagers received: Donny, Lisa and the hitman  receive life sentences while Heather only got 7 years and Derek got 11 due to having problems with mental health, and Ali got 40 years while Marty is sentenced to death by the electric chair.'] ['{{Plot}} The film begins with a college sorority initiation ceremony, in which the sorority president tries to stab a pledge in the heart, but the knife mysteriously stops in mid-air. Eighteen years later, Trina Goodwin , and her twin daughters, Sarah  and Lindsay , are driving up to Temple Hill University, where Sarah and Lindsay are starting their first semester. Along the tour, they notice a "weird" house, Pi Epsilon Delta, , and after that, they see the house they want to pledge the most, Alpha Nu Gamma. Sarah meets a girl named Vita in a bathroom, and they become good friends, while Sarah  forces other girls to apologize to Vita -and give her their shampoo-, for mocking her earlier. Then Sarah goes into a stall, and removes her many bracelets, revealing cuts on her wrists. Later on, Sarah and Lindsay meet their Student-Advisor, Finn , who delivers them two invitations to Pi Epsilon Delta for a Rushing Ceremony. At the party, Lindsay ends up having a nice time, while Sarah can\'t wait to leave. But before they do, Sarah meets the Alpha Nu President, Corrine . When they shake hands, Corrine\'s glass of punch spills all over her own dress. Sarah leaves in tears, apologizing to Corrine, and Lindsay follows. After a long talk, and a few apologies, Lindsay trips and breaks her ankle on a tree root in front of the Pi Epsilon Delta house. The girls in the house look after Lindsay, while Sarah meets Dr. Eugenia Hunter , the president of P.E.D. After a short while, Lindsay\'s ankle heals extremely fast. As the girls are leaving, Sarah asks Hunter why she invited them. Dr. Hunter claims she was a friend of her mother. The next day, Lindsay is ecstatic to find out that both she and Sarah were asked back to Alpha Nu, and Sarah also received another invitation to P.E.D., but they decide to go to Alpha Nu Gamma, where they meet with Corrine, who promises to put in a good word for Lindsay about a guy she saw  while she brushes an eyelash off Lindsay. A while later, in Sarah and Finn\'s European Mysticism class,  Dr. Hunter mentions to Sarah that she knows Sarah has magical powers, and so does she. Sarah, shocked, leaves and walks into Corrine, who cheers her up. In the evening, Sarah goes to Finn\'s room to borrow notes, but before she can get there, Corrine meets him first and says she was double-dared to introduce herself to "the hottest guy I\'ve never met" and have sex with him. Sarah catches them and leaves, followed by Corrine. Moments later, it is revealed that Corrine never saw Finn: It was Dr. Hunter who had glamored herself to look like Corrine. The next day, Sarah unintentionally uses her powers on Corrine and pushes her into a muddy ditch, then goes to see Dr. Hunter, who tells her that Alpha Nu and P.E.D. are not only lifelong rivals, but mortal enemies, fighting Good versus Evil. Sarah\'s powers, which mark her as "the One", could disrupt the balance, and Alpha Nu wants to sacrifice her to the Eternal Flame so they will live and stay out of Hell. Later, Sarah tells Lindsay what she learned, and Lindsay angrily claims that ever since the day they were born it was always about Sarah, and never about her. She leaves in tears, refusing to believe anything. Back at Alpha Nu, for a minute, we see Corrine\'s true form, as an old woman, who shape-shifts into a beautiful 21 year old college student. Esme , the Alpha Nu vice president, warns Corrine of the fight between Sarah, and Lindsay. Corrine devices a plan, and while doing so, she reveals The Knife of Truth, . She uses the eyelash she took from Lindsay to brew a potion, and used it to make the man she likes, After Lindsay realizes it was all a gag, she confronts Esme, and Corrine, who show her what she wants the most in her life,  and they promise to make her look as full-figured as she wants, if she joins. Back at their dormitory, Sarah is packing all of her belonging, saying she wants to leave, but Lindsay refuses, and wants to join Alpha Nu. Suddenly, a fire starts in their dormitory,  and Sarah at first uses heavy pillows, and coffee to put it out, but it only makes the fire grow. Sarah eventually, uses her magic to put out the fire, and it works. But the entire dormitory is declared uninhabitable by smoke-damage. Lindsay moves out leaving Sarah, and joins Alpha Nu. While Sarah sleeps in P.E.D. with her friend, Vita, who was initiated into P.E.D. The next day, Sarah and Vita become more acquainted. Sarah meets up with Finn, and they patch up their relationship, and Sarah sees Lindsay, taller, and more full-figured. Corrine offers to do the same for Sarah, if she joins. But Sarah refuses. After, Lindsay is confronted by Esme, and told that she\'s had it very nicely compared to the other pledges. She is told, "sacrifices has to be made." And Lindsay swears to do whatever she\'s told. In P.E.D.. Sarah is practicing her magic with Dr. Hunter. After a while, Dr. Hunter tells Sarah all about what Alpha Nu is trying to do, and what they will do, if Sarah doesn\'t pledge Alpha Nu. "Most likely, they\'ll just try to kill you, so we can\'t have you." And mentions how it all began, eighteen years earlier. When, both Alpha Nu, and herself thought that Sarah\'s mother was the One, but in the middle of the sacrifice, the knife refused to cut her. It was because she wasn\'t the One. She was pregnant, with twins,  and that the woman in the beginning was Sarah\'s real mother, not Trina Goodwin. Later, at Alpha Nu, Trina Goodwin is called to the Sorority House. In a fit of rage, she reveals that she killed Sarah and Lindsay\'s mother with her bare hands, and refuses to let Sarah not be initiated, and let all her 18 years of raising the girls go to waste. The next day, at the Library, Sarah tries, once more to convince Lindsay to leave together, but Lindsay refuses. Soon after, Esme attacks Sarah, and mentions that until Sarah pledges, she will throw every possible virgin into the fire to keep it alive, and that countless lives will be gone because of her. Sarah escapes, but sees that Finn is gone. She runs to the Alpha Nu house, and sees Finn tied up, and gagged. She sneaks into he house to look for him, but is caught by Lindsay, who apologizes to her and admits to being wrong about everything, and warns Sarah of a trap waiting for her. Sarah begs for Lindsay\'s help. Lindsay says that Finn is in the basement, and shows her the way. When Sarah frees Finn, Lindsay says that this was the trap, following the entrance of Corrine, and Esme. Corrine takes out the Knife of Truth, and puts it at Lindsay\'s throat. She offers Sarah the chance to offer herself willingly, and if she refuses, she will cut Lindsay\'s throat. Sarah uses her magic to snatch the knife, and put it at Esme\'s throat. Sarah says she will do it. Suddenly a drop of blood falls from the Knife, and hits the floor, causing the Eternal Flame to rise and roar with hunger. Everyone immediately sees Lindsay\'s throat is bleeding, revealing that Sarah is not the One, Lindsay is, and was all along. Corrine forces Sarah and Finn out of the house, and locks Lindsay in a room, and prepares her for the Initiation Ceremony. She calls Trina Goodwin, and tells her about Lindsay. Corrine mentions that it\'s ironic that Trina spent the last eighteen years bleeding the wrong daughter. Sarah never tried suicide, Trina was draining her blood through her wrists. Corrine decides that Trina Goodwin\'s services are no longer needed, and Corrine demands every drop of blood from Trina back, she kills Trina Goodwin with the Knife of Truth.  Sarah sends Finn to his dormitory, and she runs to P.E.D. and tells her the news. Everyone prepares for Initiation. While Sarah, in order to keep Finn safe from Alpha Nu, has sex with him to take away both of their virginity, ensuring the fact that the Eternal Flame will not take either of them. At Initiation, Sarah is initiated into P.E.D., and Lindsay is initiated into Alpha Nu Gamma. After the vows, Lindsay is taken to the basement, and  begs for freedom, and ends up being chained down upon the altar. At the same time, all of P.E.D. uses their magic to destroy the Alpha Nu house. Corrine sends all of the girls after them, and she will sacrifice Lindsay alone. Sarah runs in to free her sister, but Corrine almost ends up choking Sarah to death with the shackles used to hold Lindsay. Lindsay, finally free, picks up the Knife of Truth, cuts her hand, and stabs Corrine in the back, only to be stabbed in turn. With a handful of Lindsay\'s blood, Sarah pushes Corrine into the Eternal Flame, causing the Flame to uproar, destroying Corrine and the entire house. Back at P.E.D., Lindsay is healed by Dr. Hunter again, her inner strength proving Lindsay does have power after all. The movie ends with Dr. Hunter placing the Knife of Truth safely away forever; Sarah and all of P.E.D. walking out to find the rest of the Alpha Nus; and Esme walking off with a little bit of the Eternal Fire in a small cauldron.'] ["{{plot}} When Curt Reynolds  steals his father's security key card, he and his girlfriend, Julie Walker , decide to explore the military base where his father works.

However, a terrifying event that he witnessed as a child has left him traumatized, where his father was taken by the Boogeyman, an evil creature which lives in all closets worldwide. Since then, he has taken precautions to ensure that the Boogeyman cannot get to him, such as sleeping on a mattress on the floor, and removing all closets from his home and keeping all his clothes in a dresser drawer. After a Thanksgiving trip with Jessica to her parents' house, Tim has a premonition in which his Mother tells him to return to the family home. Tim awakes and won't relax until he finds out what happened with his mother. When he phones the hospital, he discovers his mother has died. Upon returning to the psychiatric ward where he grew up after his father died, he discovers that one of the patients, a young girl, is being threatened by the Boogeyman, which this time lives in the ceiling of her room. Upon a suggestion by his psychiatrist that returning to his family home to spend the night in that house would be a good idea, Tim returns to his old Victorian style house in the open country, where he relives memories of his mother telling his father that the Boogeyman does not exist and therefore cannot possibly harm Tim. Tim is briefly attacked by the Boogeyman when he enters the downstairs closet. However, despite enjoying a reunion with Kate, his childhood friend, he becomes convinced that he is being watched by the same entity that has terrorized him his entire life. Tim meets a young girl in his woodshed, named Franny, who wants to know that if it's true that the Boogeyman murdered Tim's father.

He and his younger brother Duron ([[Chris Brown  compete in local dance competitions as members of a crew known as the "Goon Squad". During the battle there are backs and forths, but in the end of the battle the Goon Squad win a cash-prize, and the losing home crew responds by ambushing DJ and his crewmates after the show. A fight breaks out, and the leader of the rival crew starts beating up DJ. Duron pushes him away and starts fighting him, leading the rival to pull out a gun, killing Duron. Arrested for assault, DJ is subsequently sent by his mother to live with his aunt Jackie  and uncle Nate  in Atlanta, Georgia, where he is to attend historically black Truth University. Nate, the physical plant director at Truth, aims to teach DJ responsibility and puts him to work doing maintenance as part of a work-study program. While waiting in line to register for classes, DJ sees a fellow student, April Palmer , to whom he is immediately attracted. After registration, he moves into his dorm room, where he meets his new roommate Rich Brown . Rich meets DJ at a stepping competition on the green between the Truth chapters of rival fraternities Theta Nu Theta and Mu Gamma Xi. The Mu Gamma Xi crew, seven-time national stepping champions, easily steals the show until DJ sees April across the way and runs right through their step line in an attempt to speak to her. A fight nearly breaks out between the freshman and the Gamma steppers, whose best stepper, Grant  is April\'s boyfriend. That night, Rich and his friends go out to a local club called the Phoenix and invite DJ along. Hoping to impress April and upstage Grant and the Gammas , DJ takes to the floor. Despite the animosity between DJ and Grant, the Gammas recognize his skills as a dancer and their chapter president Zeke  invites him to pledge for Mu Gamma Xi. DJ turns down both Zeke\'s offer as well as an offer from the Theta Nu Theta chapter\'s leader Sylvester . After learning that April is a student history tutor, DJ signs himself up for tutoring so that he can spend time with her. The two slowly begin a friendship and DJ takes April out to dinner. During their date, April discusses the importance of black fraternities and sororities with DJ, and tells him to visit Heritage Hall on the campus\' Greek Row. The next day, DJ learns about the significant number of African-American historical figures and celebrities who were members of various Greek-letter organizations, and decides to pledge for the Theta chapter along with Rich and their friend Noel . After "crossing over" to become official Theta members, DJ, Rich, and Noel join the Thetas\' step crew. Dismissing the chapter\'s traditional step moves as old-fashioned, DJ teaches his frat brothers a few of his old krumping moves. Sly disapproves of DJ\'s attempts to modernize Thetas\' steps, and challenges DJ to a battle at the Phoenix between his line brothers and DJ\'s; the new moves against the old. DJ\'s line brothers lose the competition due to his show-boating, though Sly lets DJ teach the crew some new moves as a compromise. April eventually leaves Grant for DJ, angering her father, Dr. William Palmer , the school\'s Provost and a Gamma brother himself. A few of the Gammas run a background check on DJ, and learn about the fight in which DJ\'s brother was killed, and for which DJ was convicted for aggravated assault in an unfair trial. This information is forwarded to the school\'s Ethics Committee, which suspends DJ for the remainder of the year. Dr. Palmer, who has the authority to overturn the Ethics Committee\'s decision, later offers to reinstate DJ with the provision that he stop seeing April, which he refuses. When April learns from her father why DJ has been suspended, she questions DJ and learns first-hand the story behind his arrest. DJ\'s Aunt Jackie, an old girlfriend of Dr. Palmer\'s, confronts him and is joined by April who overheard the conversation, leading Dr. Palmer to overturn the Ethics Committee\'s decision. Reinstated thanks to April\'s help, DJ Arrives just in time to take part in the final round of the nationals stepping competition, which ends in a tie between the Thetas and Gammas, leading to a head-to-head competition between DJ and Grant. Unknown to DJ and the Thetas, the Gammas had recorded DJ practicing his moves prior to the competition. Going first, Grant does DJ\'s exact routine from the videotape. After he finishes, DJ matches Grant move for move, but tosses in something the Gammas didn\'t get on tape: a move Duron performed to win his last competition . The Theta Nu Theta crew win the competition, and DJ is congratulated by his frat brothers as April runs out to kiss him. The scene is captured in a still black-and-white photo, which is added to the wall at Heritage Hall. A quote of Martin Luther King appears just before the credits. "Intelligence plus character.

However, Jeanie finds the two, thanks Mr. Rooney for "driving Ferris back from the hospital" and shows him the wallet that he left behind when he broke in earlier, throwing it in the mud. Mr. Rooney gets attacked by the dog, leaving Ferris with enough time to get back into bed just before his parents check on him. As the credits are rolling, Mr. Rooney, in his disheveled state, is invited by a bus driver to hitch a ride back to school on a school bus as it drives students home. Later, at the end of the credits, Ferris emerges from the bathroom, saying directly to the audience, "You\'re still here? It\'s over. Go home. Go!"'] ['Foxfire is narrated by Maddie Wirtz, a high school senior living a rather normal life in the suburbs of Portland, Oregon. Maddie is in control of her life, with a boyfriend, and plans to go to art school. One day in science class, the students are watching the teacher Mr. Buttinger try to make Rita Faldes dissect a frog. A mysterious and beautiful leather jacket-clad "new student" stands up to Mr. Buttinger and releases Rita\'s frog. When Mr. Buttinger sentences them both to detention, the drifter reveals that she\'s not a new student after all, and escapes through the same window as the frog. Later, in the girls\' restroom, the drifter and some other girls are listening to Rita describe Mr. Buttinger\'s untoward advances. When the drifter says the only way to stop the teacher is to stick together, the only girls to stay are Rita, Violet, and Maddie. When detention time comes, Mr. Buttinger indeed begins his advances toward Rita, but is startled by Violet\'s entry. When Maddie and the drifter come in soon after, he realizes the situation is becoming serious. The girls confront the teacher about his abuse, and they become involved in a physical altercation, which ends when the ordinarily shy Rita slams his face against a lab bench and tells him "if you ever put your hands on me again, I\'m gonna snip your little nuts off with my toenail clippers." At this point Goldie Goldberg walks in, and joins the assault by declaring "this is great; Buttinger is such a fuck." The girls run from the school and then decide to go home. At Maddie\'s house, Maddie is surprised by a knock at the window, which turns out to be the stranger from the earlier assault, there to return Maddie\'s dropped address book. The girl tells Maddie she\'s a drifter who got kicked out of school "for thinking for herself." Maddie agrees to let her sleep on the floor. The next morning, Maddie catches up with the girl on a bridge. The girl tells Maddie her name is "Legs", and brings Maddie\'s art supplies up onto the bridge. Maddie, who is afraid of heights, can\'t join her. A truck startles Legs, who drops the art portfolio over the edge of the bridge. Legs climbs over the edge of the bridge to retrieve the bag, which deeply impresses Maddie. As they part, Maddie tells Legs of an abandoned house up the river where Legs could stay. At school, the girls are called in to the principal\'s office, where their claims of sexual harassment fall on deaf ears, and they are suspended for three weeks. The girls are escorted off campus, and Maddie is not allowed to retrieve her art school portfolio. Instead of going home with the news of their suspension, they all decide to go to the abandoned house up the river. There they meet Legs, who suggests they break into the school to get Maddie\'s portfolio. The girls sneak into the high school through a vent, and go into the art room. While the other girls are busy collecting Maddie\'s work, Goldie is put off by an unflattering Polaroid, and moves into a side room to smoke a joint. She throws her match into a pile of oily rags, starting a fire, and setting off the sprinklers. The girls have to escape the police who come to investigate, and eventually reconvene at the house. Back at the house, Legs decides to commemorate the night by giving herself a tattoo of a flame on her breast. One by one, the other girls ask Legs to give them the same tattoo. This act dictates the final bond that tie the girls together. However, things start to go terribly wrong. First, Maddie is threatened by a group of jocks who dislike the idea of the girls reporting their abusive teacher, since he is also the coach of their football team. During an attempt to "teach her" a lesson, she is rescued by the rest of the group and they steal Dana\'s  car, with Legs driving. Eventually, after running into some cops on patrol, they continue their run after Legs refuses to stop, leading to an accident which in turn leads to Legs being put in a correctional facility. The girls continue on, but aren\'t as close-knit anymore. Goldie gives in to the pressure and runs away from home. Maddie somehow finds her and brings her back to the abandoned house. After Legs gets out, she returns to the "hang out", and is shocked to see Goldie\'s state. She, together with Maddie, go to Goldie\'s  parents home, demanding 10 grand for rehabilitation purposes for Goldie. When her father refuses, Legs threatens him with his own gun and takes him hostage to the house, where they tie him to a chair and pressure him for the money. Goldie, oblivious to this, is startled to see her dad and calls out to him in surprise. This however, surprises Rita, who accidentally shoots Goldie\'s father in the chest. Chaos ensues, but the girls keep calm and decide to take him to the hospital. Rita drives the others while Maddie and Legs stay back. The scene towards the end of the film centers around Legs and her relationship with Maddie. Legs is done with her current circumstances and surroundings and is shown walking the highway again, looking for a ride. It is this same highway upon where Maddie almost lost her art portfolio. Maddie finds Legs and calls out to her in an attempt to make her stay. Legs is hesitant, but holds to her decision to leave. Upon Maddie\'s disappointment, Legs asks her to come along. After thinking for a while about her future, Maddie decides to stay but assures Legs that she will never forget her. Legs, hopeful that Maddie will choose to come along, is slightly overwhelmed, but understands and reciprocates, by telling Maddie she will always be in her heart. As Legs\' boards the truck that stopped, Maddie watches it disappear down the road and walks over to climb the bridge (in the same way that Legs did, thus conquering her fear of heights. In a voice-over, we hear that Maddie has graduated high school, got accepted into art school, and has traveled half way around the world, stopping at airports and bus stops along the way. She has not seen Legs again, but she meets the others once in a while, and they get together to reminisce about the past.'] ['Jamie McGregor  is a virginal sixth-former in suburbia delivering groceries for the local supermarket, but he is more interested in other matters - Mary, Linda, Paula and Caroline. He tries to seduce the girls of his dreams in the swinging sixties.'] ['Steve Clark  is a high school senior whose family moves to Cradle Bay, a picturesque coastal town in Washington state. Steve soon befriends three outcast students, Gavin Strick , U.V. , and Rachel Wagner . Gavin tries to tell Steve that he believes there is something evil about the "Blue Ribbons"— a clique of students taking part in a "special program" led by the school psychologist, Dr. Caldicott . Steve is understandably skeptical. The following day at lunch, Gavin walks in looking like a Blue Ribbon. When Steve tries to confront Gavin, he gets punched in the stomach for his impertinence. Now Steve and Rachel must find the source of the Blue Ribbons as well as try and save the rest of the school before it\'s too late. They find a DVD-rom disc that Gavin hid for them in the boiler room, before his "transformation," which tells them about the club and about the history that he learned about Dr. Caldicott. During this, Steve also befriends Dorian ([[William Sadler , the school janitor, who appears to be mentally handicapped and hunts rats for the city for some exta cash. Dorian demonstrates a device called an E-Rat-icator which emits a soft, high pitched whine that is supposed to be innocuous but annoying to rats, which is an abysmal failure. Steve discovers that Dorian is actually highly intelligent, and carries classical literature pieces with him, and that he\'s hiding because he wishes to be left alone and does not trust society. Dorian also tells Steve that he suspects that the entire community of Cradle Bay is part of a massive conspiracy made up of nearly all of the parents, as well as the local police chief and the school principal, who hired Dr. Caldicott to "re-program" their own children to become the perfect people that they want them to be and not free thinkers. A little later, during an encounter where a Blue Ribbon assaults Rachel, the E-Rat-icator goes off, and immediately sends the student into a psychotic fit, driving him away. During their personal investigation, Steve and Rachel try to find out what has been happening to these Blue Ribbon kids, which leads them to a mental hospital called Bishop Flats following a lead on the DVD that Gavin left behind. Here, they find out that mind control is being used to make depressed, awkward and unruly teens become perfect so they can function properly in life, but the programming has some glitches that lead to momentary relapses which cause violent fits. Also at Bishop Flats, they find Caldicott\'s daughter, Betty , a failed project who spends her time repeating the same phrase: "Meet the musical little creatures that hide among the flowers". When Rachel and Steve return, they plan to get out of town along with Steve\'s little sister, Lindsay , but when they get back, Steve\'s parents (Terry David Mulligan and [[Susan Hogan  reveal that they are also part of the conspiracy and that they moved to Cradle Bay for the sole purpose to sign him up for Caldicott\'s program. Steve and Lindsay try to get out but they get ambushed by a group of Blue Ribbons waiting for them. They drag Steve and Rachel to the programming center, but Steve escapes and rescues Rachel. They try to get out of town again with Lindsay and U.V., but the Blue Ribbons and Caldicott are waiting for them on the road near the ferry out of town. When hope seems lost, Dorian the school janitor drives up, his car hooked up with multiple E-Rat-icators that scramble the mind control tech inside the Blue Ribbons\' heads. They chase after Dorian and try to destroy the E-Rat-icators, but, having been fatally wounded after being shot by Caldicott, he drives his car off a cliff with several Blue Ribbons hanging onto his car. This leads to a final battle between Steve and Caldicott, which Steve wins by kicking Caldicott off the cliff. Steve and Rachel then leave town on the ferry with Lindsay and U.V. to begin a new life elsewhere. The final scene shows a classroom in an urban high school with kids playing loud music, cursing, and acting up. They are informed that they have a new teacher. The well-groomed substitute turns around, and it\'s Gavin, with the blue ribbon "twinkle" still active in his eye.'] ['{{plot}} A couple, Halley Smith  and Rich Stoker  are rock climbing in the remote West Virginia forest. As Rich prepares to help Halley, he is suddenly murdered. Someone begins to pull Halley up the cliff so she cuts the rope and falls to the ground.

He stops at an old rundown gas station and meets an old man . The old man is not helpful, but Chris views a map detailing another possible route that heads straight towards the city to which he needs to go. Chris decides to take the road and as he is driving he crashes into a Range Rover stranded in the middle of the road. The car belongs to a group of friends on a hiking trip: Jessie Burlingame , Carly , her fiancé Scott , and a couple - Evan and Francine . Their tires have been punctured by a piece of barbed wire in the woods. Jessie, Carly, and Scott go to find help and Chris joins them. Evan and Francine stay to watch the cars, and as Evan starts to fix their car he hears a strange noise. He goes to the woods to investigate. After a while, Francine notices that he is missing, and she goes into the woods to look for him. As Francine ventures further into the woods, she finds his sneaker, and his severed ear. She stumbles back, horrifed, as a figure kills her with a strip of barbed wire. As Chris, Jessie, Carly and Scott try to find help, they find an isolated cabin. They go inside and discover miscellaneous objects and human body parts. Horrified they attempt to escape, but they hear the occupants coming back and are forced to hide. Three cannibalistic mountain men, all of whom are extremely disfigured, enter the cabin and bring in Francine\'s dead body. Chris, Jessie, Carly and Scott silently watch in horror, as her body is brutally butchered and messily eaten. As the cannibals fall asleep, Chris, Jessie, Scott and Carly silently escape.

They find an old watchtower and begin to climb up and find a radio and use it to call for help, but do not get a response. Later they see the cannibals armed with torches, and reaching the foot of the watchtower. The radio starts responding to their call, alerting the cannibals. Carly tries to make an urgent response but is interrupted when "Three Finger" tries to climb into the watchtower. He tries to get through the panel on the floor of the tower but is stopped by Chris. The cannibals set the tower on fire. Chris, Carly and Jessie escape by jumping out of the window into a nearby tree. They begin to climb up, but Three-Finger starts to climb up a tree near them. Chris and Jessie begin to climb higher as Carly attempts to climb further. Chris and Jessie make it to another tree, but Three-Finger sneaks up behind Carly and decapitates her. Three Finger begins to pursue Jessie, but Chris manages to hit him with a tree branch and he falls out of the tree. They manage to escape and hide in a cave near a waterfall until the next morning. Just as they find a road out of the woods, the mountain men find them and push Chris down the hill and capture Jessie and take her back to their cabin. Chris survives the fall and meets a sheriff, but before he is able to convince the Sheriff of what is happening, the Sheriff is shot with an arrow. Chris attempts to drive away in the car, but can not find the key, so instead hitches a ride underneath the car as the cannibal drives it back to the cabin. When the cannibals arrive at the cabin, Jessie is tied to a bed and gagged with a leash, crying for help. After Saw-Tooth goes inside with the sheriff\'s body, Chris gets down from the bottom of the police truck. As Jessie is about to be killed, Chris, who is driving the police truck, breaks through the cabin and runs into "One-Eye". Chris unties Jessie and they fight the cannibals. They escape quickly as Chris manages to kill the cannibals by blowing up their cabin with a shotgun. Chris and Jessie, driving the cannibals\' truck, stop back at the gas station.

He then gets back into the truck, he and Jessie drive down the road, as the credits roll. The credits are interrupted by a scene showing a deputy sheriff investigating and picking over the remains of the destroyed cabin. Three-Finger, who survived the explosion, comes up behind the deputy. Three-Finger kills him.

Wanting a break from his home life, Zack makes little effort to escape. Johnny, meanwhile, pawns Zack off on his right-hand man Frankie, who initially offers him a chance to get away. Zack declines the offer, not wanting to cause any trouble for his brother and the two strike up an unlikely friendship. Zack stays with Frankie at his father\'s house, does chores, and ingratiates himself with Frankie\'s friends, including Keith Stratten , and Julie , the youngest member of the group. By this point a number of hangers-on and friends of the gang know of Zack\'s kidnapping, though only Susan  seems concerned about it. Frankie grows nervous when Johnny hypothetically offers Frankie $2,500 to murder Zack and dispose of his body. Frankie furiously declines and Johnny claims it was a joke. Instead, Johnny agrees to Frankie\'s plan to pay Zack to keep his mouth shut. However, after a conversation with his lawyer and threatening phone calls from Jake, Johnny decides the risk of ending up in prison or getting killed is too great to let Zack go. Johnny calls Elvis and offers to erase a drug debt if he kills Zack. Meanwhile, at a raucous going-away party, Zack demonstrates his martial arts skills on Frankie, who realizes he could have escaped at any time. Frankie and his friends still believe Zack will be returning home at the end of the night.

Zack is not aware of what\'s going on and grows suspicious when a deeply saddened Keith silently tells Frankie he can\'t go through with it, and, after giving Zack a goodbye hug, goes to wait in the car. Zack sees the grave and begins to break down, sobbing and begging Frankie and Elvis to let him go. Frankie tells Elvis that they shouldn\'t do it, but Elvis is keen on the job he\'s been given. Realizing now that there\'s no going back, Frankie calms Zack down and tells him that he would never hurt him, and ties a weeping Zack up with tape. He is astonished when Elvis violently knocks Zack into the grave with the shovel and then fires at Zack with a submachine gun, killing him. Frankie and Elvis then silently leave.

Several miles in, the tire gets a flat and they are unable to get cell phone signals to call for help. While repairing the car, Sam confronts Nick about how he thinks Nick is wasting his life being a musician, his latest fling with Christine being another mistake on his judgement list. As they are arguing, they are approached by a grizzly bear.

He tricks them into leaving for the car again and attacks again; this time he is able to catch Christine who is killed then dragged away while the others watch. Nick begins to think that the bear is taking out his revenge on them one-by-one due to a native American legend that bears are actually the reincarnated spirits of shaman and are capable of human thoughts and emotion. Sam dismisses this and they set a trap to try to keep the bear in the car in order for them to escape. The trap is sprung, but Nick is nearly killed by the bear, forcing Sam and Liz to release the bear and retreat back into the vehicle themselves. Sam opts as a marathon runner to jog the several miles to the restaurant, but when he arrives he is attacked before he can get help by the bear who followed him. Meanwhile, Liz tells Nick that she and Sam have been having serious financial troubles which has caused a rift in their marriage putting him into extraordinary debt and possibly under scrutiny for embezzlement from Sam's company, which is the reason he gave their father a Porsche . Sam is returned rather violently by the bear and released to climb into the car. Nick surmises there must be a reason Sam had been returned, and Liz reveals to him that she's pregnant. But it was established earlier that due to the rift in their marriage, they hadn't slept together in about six months while she is two months pregnant. Nick realizes that he is the father, due to an affair he and Liz had months prior which breaks Sam's heart and Nick realizes the true reason the bear had locked all three of them together; Sam, realizing that Liz might be happier with Nick offers to sacrifice himself and attack the bear so the other two can escape, as he is dying, Nick rushes to help and is killed as well. The bear approaches Liz, who sinks to her knees as the bear sniffs her, closing her eyes ready to die. But the attack never comes, and the bear instead leaves her alone, likely having sensed her pregnancy.

They are brothers--fraternal twins Robbie ([[Aaron Johnson  and Tom ([[Sean Bourke . Georgia announces to her mates that it is "Boy stalking time", and soon the girls follow the boys, who are exploring Eastbourne with their friend Dave "the Laugh" . Jas and Georgia find out that Robbie and Tom\'s mother owns a small, local, and organic vegetable store. They go there, pretending to be customers, and Jas and Tom quickly bond. Jas quickly tells Georgia that she\'s interested in Tom, and Georgia agrees because she soon realizes that Robbie, the other brother, has a cat and plays in a band. Soon after, Georgia hatches a plan to get closer to Robbie, by pretending that her cat, Angus, has gone missing. Jas has had Angus on a leash in another part of town the whole time, but he escapes while she is watching Tom playing sports, and Tom ends up rescuing him. Georgia had discovered that Robbie\'s parents were divorced while they were "looking" for Angus. Soon after the rescue, Tom asks Jas out and the pair begin dating while  Georgia discovers that Robbie is seeing Georgia\'s rival - Lindsay. In the midst of all this, Georgia\'s father has been offered a job in New Zealand, and he goes to New Zealand to prepare for the family to move out with him. During his absence, Georgia\'s mum hires a handsome builder called Jem to re-do the living room, and begins to spend increasingly longer periods of time with him, making Georgia worried as to the state of her parents marriage. Also, Georgia becomes the unofficial head of the house by doing a vast majority of the cooking, and the looking after of Libby, her sister. Georgia is upset with Jas one day at school because Jas is constantly abandoning the Ace Gang to hang out with Tom. She won\'t walk into school with them, eat lunch with them, or leave school with them. During gym class, Georgia explains this to her, and Jas quickly tells them later that she\'s gotten them all invited to an exclusive party. The Ace Gang goes to a local boy\'s house  named Peter Dyer who would "help out", so to speak, girls who were having trouble kissing. Peter Dyer took a severe liking to Georgia, and kept calling her and not leaving her alone. He confronts her at the party, by practically forcing her to dance with him, and tells her that he needs to talk to her. In so doing, he drags her outside against her will, and begins talking to her. He claims that Georgia drives him crazy and that she\'s his best student, whereupon he grabs her again and kisses her. Georgia, in an attempt not to kiss him back, falls backwards and into some bushes. At that same time, Robbie and Lindsay, and Jas and Tom arrive at the party together. Robbie sees the exchange and angrily goes inside, while Lindsay pokes fun at the situation by rudely commenting on the size of Georgia\'s underwear for, when Peter and Georgia fell, her skirt came up. Jas looks apologetically at Georgia as Georgia tries her best to get out of there with dignity. Tom invites Jas to go swimming with him and Robbie. In the previous scene, Georgia expressed her humiliation of the events at the party the other night. Jas explains that she will be going to the pool, and tells Georgia that this will be the perfect opportunity for Georgia to explain the events to Robbie herself. When Georgia wants to know where Lindsay will be, she hears from Jas that Lindsay doesn\'t like the water. Georgia meets them at the pool and brings her sister along as she is stuck babysitting her. Georgia manages to get Jas to come into the changing room with her, and while Libby is changing, she shows Jas what she has accidentally done to her legs. In an effort to make her legs look less pale, she put some spray tan onto them and they turned orange because she used too much. When they all come out again, and after Georgia hastily introduces Libby to Robbie  Jas helpfully asks Tom to take Libby swimming with the two of them. Robbie asks Georgia to swim with him, and then Georgia tells Robbie that she\'s not dating Peter, and that it was all a big misunderstanding. Robbie is pleased, and they enjoy a brief splash play-fight. Then, Georgia suggests that they do handstands. While she does hers, Robbie gets a good look at Georgia\'s legs. Georgia, embarrassed, says that she is a pathetic excuse for a girl, and Robbie playfully comments that they look like "giant cheezy puffs". Georgia covers her face in slight humiliation and Robbie pulls Georgia\'s hands away, leading to the kiss that Georgia has been wanting. Robbie awkwardly pulls away from her, then leaves, claiming that he has to "sort some things out" but that he will call Georgia later. Georgia calls Jas and tells her about it, and Jas is very happy for her. Then, Georgia tells Jas where she and Robbie left their conversation, and Jas doesn\'t understand what Robbie meant by "sort some some things out" either. Then, Georgia tells Jas that Robbie said that he would call her, and Jas tells Georgia that Tom called her the same day he\'d told her that he would be calling her. Georgia says goodbye to Jas, and then the phone rings, but it is her dad, telling her that he\'s really enjoying New Zealand, but that he only wants to speak to her mother. Georgia hangs up when the doorbell rings, and she goes to see who it is. It is Peter, who is very happy to see Georgia, and goes in to kiss her again. Georgia steps outside and closes the door behind her so her mum, or Libby won\'t hear. She tells Peter that she is "still recovering from her injuries" and that she can\'t go out with him. When Peter demands to know why, Georgia says the only thing that she can come up with: "I can\'t go out with you because I\'m a lesbian!" which makes Peter drop the flowers he brought for her in shock. In the next few days, Dave the Laugh passes Georgia notes in the library, asking Georgia if she is really a lesbian. Georgia, after finding out who sent the note, says that she isn\'t. Then, Dave says that Robbie said that she wasn\'t. This sparks new interest for Georgia, and then Dave tells her that the Stiff Dylan\'s are having a gig in Brighton, which upsets Georgia because Robbie didn\'t tell her about it. Georgia ends up asking Dave the Laugh to the gig, after reading Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus Georgia hatches a plan to make Robbie to realize his feelings for her by going to the gig with Dave the Laugh. Robbie tries to talk to Georgia at the gig, but is stopped by Lindsay, who tells him that she is holding a party. Dave walks Georgia home, and Dave confesses to Georgia that he really likes her. He tries to kiss her, but Georgia makes him give her a handshake instead. He then respectfully kisses her on the cheek, and says "see you around, beautiful" which upsets Georgia. The next day at school, Dave won\'t talk to Georgia, as he\'s found out that she was only using him to make Robbie jealous. When Georgia confronts Dave on this, he calls Georgia a "heartless user" and tells her that he is upset that she tested her "elastic band theory" on him. Dave ends up telling Robbie that Georgia was only using him, and he stops talking to her as well, due to the fact that he and Dave are best friends. Georgia soon finds out during gym class that it was Jas that leaked this information, and they have an argument, which quickly turns physical  and they vow never to speak to each other again. Feeling like there is no point in staying in England, because she no longer has any friends and is very upset in general, Georgia decides that it is best for everyone if they would move to New Zealand. She makes major changes in her life, including taking better care of the house due to her mother\'s frequent absences, cooking and looking after Libby, throwing out her teen magazines, listening to dolphins, and doing yoga for relaxation purposes. She even dyes a streak of her hair a shocking blonde. Before she leaves she goes to the beach for a walk knowing Robbie would be there and apologizes to him. Robbie tells her that he dumped Lindsay, which makes Georgia sit down to take in the news. Robbie also tells her that he wrote a song about her called "Bitch in a Uniform" and that he wrote it when he was pissed off at her, but that he still likes her. He stands up and she does the same, and he offers her his hand, and Georgia thinks that he is merely calling a truce. Robbie laughs and calls her a "moppet" and tells her to hold his hand so that they can walk together. They are about to kiss for the second time, but Robbie discovers her blonde streak, and tells Georgia not to dye her hair. In the end Georgia\'s mum takes her to a club for the first time and it turns out to be a surprise fifteenth birthday party, which Jas had secretly organized with Georgia\'s mum. She is greeted by all her friends and her family, with Jas and Georgia befriending each other again. Georgia\'s mother tells her that she must also thank Jem for the party as well, and, after doing so, begs her mother not to get a divorce. Her mother doesn\'t know what she\'s talking about, and reveals something else. Upon turning around, Georgia realizes that, as a surprise, Georgia\'s father has returned from New Zealand, deciding to stay in Eastbourne for a better job opportunity. When her mother asks Georgia to clarify what she was talking about when she mentioned divorce, another man comes up and stands with Jem. He wishes Georgia a happy birthday, and Georgia\'s mother says that this man, who is Jem\'s boyfriend, owns the club, and they\'ve all become friends so Georgia could have the party that she wanted. The Stiff Dylans are performing the song "Ultraviolet" which Robbie had written about Georgia. During the song, Georgia introduces Ellen  to Dave, who is still upset with Georgia. They are immediately attracted to one another, and end up sharing a kiss. Georgia also introduces an unnamed girl to Peter, and we don\'t know what happens between them. The Stiff Dylan\'s are interrupted mid-song by an angry Lindsay who had come from her own party  and tells Robbie that he would either have to take her back or lose her forever. Lindsay calls Georgia several rude names, and calls herself perfect, and declares that it\'s perfectly obvious which one he should choose. Robbie takes Georgia\'s hand and pulls her on-stage, tells her that Georgia is the one he wants, and that she\'s perfect for him. Jas, and the other members of the Ace Gang join them on-stage, and Jas says that Robbie prefers girls that are "un-fake" and pulls Lindsay\'s "jellies" out of her bra. Robbie apologizes to Georgia that Lindsay tried to ruin her party, and Georgia asks Robbie if he really thinks she\'s perfect. Robbie says that he thinks she\'s mad, but that she\'s perfect for him, and he kisses Georgia on-stage. The movie ends with a scene that begins at Georgia\'s breakfast table with her parents, Libby, and Angus. She tells us that now she is very happy with her life, and that she doesn\'t mind if her parents show their affection in front of them, and she doesn\'t mind Libby\'s weirdness, and she doesn\'t mind having a big nose. As she walks out of the house to go to school, we see Robbie waiting for her, so that they can walk to school together. The scene changes to them on a date, simply walking around London and laughing together.'] ["A boy obsessed with football finds his life changing dramatically once he adds a little Samba.

Vicky later accuses Kevin of being with her only for sex, and he must try and repair his relationship with her before the upcoming prom night, when the four plan to lose their virginity. He eventually succeeds. Oz, meanwhile, joins the jazz choir in an effort to lose his reputation as an insensitive jock and finds a girlfriend there. He soon wins the attention of Heather , a girl in the choir. However, he runs into problems when Heather comes to learn about Oz\'s reputation and subsequently breaks up with him, although he later manages to regain some of her trust, and later most of it when he leaves the lacrosse championship to perform a duet with her in a choir competition. Jim, meanwhile, attempts to pursue Nadia , an exchange student from Czechoslovakia who asks Jim for help to study for an upcoming test. Stifler persuades him to set up a webcam in his room so that they can all watch it together. The plan suffers a hiccup, though, when Nadia discovers Jim\'s pornography collection and sits half-naked on his bed to read and masturbate to it. Jim is persuaded to return to his room, where he joins Nadia, unaware that he accidentally sent the weblink to the entire school directory and the members of the pop-punk band Blink-182. As Nadia is preparing to have sex with him, he prematurely ejaculates twice, humiliating himself live in front of the entire school. Shortly afterwards Nadia leaves school and goes back home, now leaving Jim completely dateless for prom, and his likeliness of losing his virginity before high school is over. In sheer desperation, Jim asks band camp geek Michelle Flaherty  to the senior prom as she is apparently the only girl at his school who did not see what happened. Finch, meanwhile, pays Vicky\'s friend, Jessica , $200 to spread rumors around the school of his sexual prowess, hoping that it will increase his chances of success. Unfortunately, he runs into trouble when Stifler, angry that a girl turned him down for the prom because she was waiting for Finch to ask her, puts a laxative into Finch\'s cappuccino. Finch, being paranoid about the lack of cleanliness in the school restrooms, and unable to go home to use the toilet as he usually does, is tricked by Stifler into using the girls\' restroom.

Kevin and Vicky have sex in an upstairs bedroom. Vicky breaks up with Kevin afterwards on the grounds that they will drift apart when they go to college, with him attending the University of Michigan and her at Cornell University; he tries to persuade her otherwise but quickly realizes that the distance between the two schools will be too much of a burden. Oz confesses the pact to Heather, and renounces it, saying that just by them being together makes him a winner. They reconcile and wind up making love together on the dock. Oz, honoring his newfound sensitivity, never confesses to what they did. Jim and Michelle have sex after he finds out that she is actually not as naïve as she let on and that she saw the "Nadia Incident" after all.

Jim is surprised to discover that Michelle behaves unexpectedly aggressively in bed. In the morning he wakes up to find her gone and realizes that she had used him for a one-night stand, which Jim thinks is "cool." Dateless, Finch strays downstairs to the basement recreation room where he meets Stifler\'s Mom . She is aroused by his precociousness, and they have sex on the pool table. In the morning, Stifler enters the room, realizes that his mom has had sex with Finch and faints, unable to believe that his mom and "Shit-break" are together.

Slannen joins Ella on her quest, but they are captured by a group of ogres, who prepare to cook and eat them. They are rescued by Prince Charmont. He then accompanies her to a wedding in the land of giants, where Ella hopes to find Lucinda. As they make their way there, the prince and Ella begin to fall in love.

Sir Edgar also reveals that he murdered Prince Charmont\'s father. To prevent the murder of Char, Ella asks Slannen to tie her to a tree outside the city and to find the giants so they can help. Lucinda now appears before Ella, who asks her to undo the "gift" of obedience. Offended by the request, Lucinda refuses, saying that if Ella no longer wants the spell, she must remove it herself. She unties Ella from the tree and gives her a fancy dress and tells her to attend the ball. When Ella gets to the ball, Charmont almost immediately takes her to the Hall of Mirrors and asks her to marry him. Ella is about to stab him with the dagger Edgar provided, when she realizes how to free herself from the curse: looking into a mirror, she orders herself to no longer be obedient. This saves Prince Charmont from his uncle\'s treachery. But Edgar is watching the entire scene behind a two-way mirror, and before Ella can explain to Char why she tried to kill him, he orders the guards in, to lock her up and have her executed in a few days. Meanwhile, Slannen gets the giants, and the ogres come to help as well. They sneak into the castle just before the coronation. They rescue Ella and find out that Sir Edgar is poisoning the crown that is to be put on Char\'s head in the ceremony.

The film begins with Carl Willat  and his friends, Ritchie White , Claude Zachary , and Johnny  hanging out at the rec, which is the only place in the community where young people  can spend time and be somewhat supervised by rec counselor Julia . From a vantage point above an overpass, Mark Perry  and his friend shoot a hole in the windshield of a passing patrol car with a BB gun and flee through New Grenada on their bikes. They pass Carl and Ritchie and tell them to hide because the police are on their way. Sgt. Ed Doberman , arrives shortly, spots the boys, and pulls them from their hiding place in the weeds behind an electrical control box. He searches them and finds a three-inch pocket knife in Ritchie\'s pocket, so he shoves the pair into the patrol car, takes them to the station, and calls Carl\'s father Fred , to come pick up the boy and warns him about the pair\'s delinquent behavior. Carls father Fred Willat is the owner of the local Cadillac dealership and is well-connected within New Grenada\'s business community. Before getting Doberman\'s call, he is talking to Homeowner\'s Association president Jerry Cole  about getting wealthy Texas landowner Mr. Sloan  to come to see the land across the street from the rec, and hopefully build an industrial park there instead of the planned twin cinema and roller rink, thereby making the community friendlier to business at the expense of the local kids. Back at the police station, Doberman is questioning Ritchie and Carl about who had the BB gun when Ritchie utters the most famous quote from the movie: "I only got one law: a kid who tells on another kid... is a dead kid." Ritchie is then taken out of the room while Doberman continues lecturing Carl and warns him that, if he continues his bad behavior, he will likely end up at the hill, an infamous juvenile detention facility in the area. Once home, Carl goes upstairs to his bedroom and blares Cheap trick on his headphones. The next day at school, Carl and Ritchie tell Claude about their misadventure with the police, and Claude announces that he took speed  to prepare for an upcoming test: a surprise creative writing assignment related to the slide of a painting that was projected onto the classroom wall. The audience is not sure if the image shown in the film is the actual painting or merely Claude\'s ghastly, nightmarish hallucination. Afterward, the students are assembled in the school\'s Cafeterium for a presentation about the recent shooting of the police car, where Carl exchanges looks and smiles with Cory . That evening, Carl gets dressed to go out  and then goes downstairs and asks his father about the land across from the rec. Fred tells him about the new proposal for an industrial park, telling him that it would be a better reason for peopel to move to New Grenada than "a bowling alley," [sic] and the apoplectic Carl storms out to go join his friends over at the rec. The kids have brought pot, alcohol, and music to an impromptu party at the rec\'s playground, where Claude buys a gram of hash from his friend Tip . An announcement about a party at a boy\'s nearby house spreads through the crowd of kids, and the group migrates there to encounter a burgeoning party replete with everything teens are into: sex, drugs, beer, and Van Halen. Carl is handed a joint on his way to the basement, where he sees Mark making out with Cory on a couch. Coming over for a hit from the joint, Mark threatens Carl by saying that if he mentions his name to the cops, he\'ll be eating through a tube, then melts away into the party. Carl gets upset with Cory, telling her that she could do a lot better than Mark. Carl then leaves, followed  by Mark and his friend. While Carl is walking home alone, they jump him, beat him up, and take his money. When Carl gets home, he tries to avoid his parents seeing the cuts and bruises, but fails. Carl gets questioned, but, when refusing to tell them who jumped him, runs upstairs and locks himself in his room. Fred and Jerry Cole then talk about making sure The Rec is closed the next day, when Sloan comes to visit. The next day at The Rec, everyone is talking about Carl\'s event, but he only releases the names of his attackers to Claude, Ritchie, Johnny, and Alan , another friend of theirs. While they\'re talking, Julia , The Rec counselor, goes outside to talk to Doberman about The Rec staying open. Doberman goes inside and searches Claude, finding the gram of hash in his pocket, and taking him in. However, when they walk outside, Ritchie is standing on the cop car, and makes the cops chase him around the grounds. When the cops finally leave, Carl, and Ritchie go to get sodas, where Ritchie gives Carl firecrackers. They then get on their bikes and ride around the neighborhood, where they find Cory and her best friend Abby  running out of a house, carrying a plastic bag. They stop them, and grab the bag, finding a gun in it, which the girls stole from the house. They then all go to a half-finished town home, which Carl and Ritchie call their condo. After planning a picnic with a gun Cory gets up and starts dancing, with the gun in her hand, pointing it at Carl playfully, but the gun goes off, and Carl scares everyone into thinking he is shot. The group then goes their separate ways. When Carl gets home, he sees Sloan\'s car in the driveway, and, upset at his father, places the firecrackers given to him by Ritchie in the car\'s engine, so that when the car is turned on, they will light. Sloan and his boys, scared, then leave, but not before warning Fred that if he doesn\'t stop to listen to his son, it will come back to bite him. The next day, Carl calls Claude and Johnny, telling them to come to the picnic. They all show up, and after shooting the gun, and realizing that Carl is the only one with any sense of aim at all, they start walking. During the walk, Claude tells them that it was Tip who sold him the hash, and Cory announces that Tip had recently gotten busted for possession. They then decide to pay Tip a visit, and while the boys hold Tip down and interrogate him, the girls ransack his kitchen. Tip tells them that he told Doberman who he sold the hash to, because he was arrested last month. Ritchie then points the gun at him, preparing to shoot Tip, but Johnny lights a firecracker that makes a gun sound, which Tip\'s mother interprets as her son being fatally shot. Before leaving, the boys throw Tip in the water under his porch. Before Cory and Abby leave Carl and Ritchie, Cory runs over to Carl and gives him a kiss, showing him that she likes him as much as he likes her. When Carl gets home, his mother tells him that he is forbidden to see Claude or Ritchie any longer, and that The Rec will be closed until a new counselor can be found. Carl gets in a fight with his father, and when Carl takes a swing at him, he smacks him across the face, causing him to, once again, lock himself in his room. The next day at school, in science class, Carl overhears Tip\'s mother and the school\'s principal  talking in a connected classroom. Tip\'s mother tells the principal the names of the boys that assaulted her son, and this causes Carl to snap. He then grabs Ritchie in the hallway and they run home. Ritchie grabs his gun, and they steal his mother\'s car, leaving town. However, Doberman sees them leave, and chases them. During the chase, Carl begs Ritchie to throw the gun out of the car, but he refuses. The car then gets flipped over, the two boys running in opposite directions. Ritchie points the gun at Doberman, who mistakes it for loaded, so Doberman shoots and kills Ritchie.

She brings a sleeping bag, and they spend the night together. After Cory leaves in the morning, Carl runs home to grab money, and along the way he sees Mark riding his dirt bike. He takes Mark\'s B.B. gun, and shoots him in the shoulder , causing him to flip over his bike. Mark then sits down with Carl, talking about what they\'re going to do about the parent situation.

Then Carl goes home, and upon climbing into the house through an upstairs window, he sees his mother on the phone with his father about a big meeting at the school that night, to talk about the new trend of violence with the children. He then locks himself in his mother\'s room, and gets on the phone, asking his parents if they wish he got shot, too. After leaving his home that night, Carl goes to The Rec, where, all of his friends are. They then make a plan to show the parents that they need to listen to them: lock them in the school\'s auditorium, and wreck the school. Carl climbs onto the roof, entering the school through a sun window above a science classroom. The kids then take their bike chains and lock the gates surrounding the auditorium. The children decide that the only thing that will make them feel better is to trash the school, and all of the cars in the parking lot. However, when they find guns, all hell breaks loose. The kids run around shooting cars and lighting firecrackers in school-owned property, causing massive explosions and fiery mayhem. When Cory almost gets blown up by an explosion caused by Mark, and can\'t find Carl, Claude and Johnny agree to take her home, but not before Johnny gives a phone to Julia, who is sitting by a gate in the school.

However, Mark, who is waiting down the road with his B.B. gun, shoots the car, causing Doberman to run it off the road into The Rec. Doberman gets knocked out, and The Rec catches on fire. Carl grabs Doberman\'s keys, and unlocks himself from the car. He runs away, and stops and turns around just in time to see The Rec blow up, killing Doberman.

Carl then turns around to face the front of the bus, quite content with the fact that his friends are safe, and that Cory still loves him.'] ['After leaving a party at a women\'s dormitory , Matthew  is trapped in an elevator with an unknown, and unseen, woman when the power goes out. Matthew and this unknown woman have sex in the dark. When Matthew wakes up in the morning—still in the elevator—he finds himself alone with a pair of her panties.http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0214388/synopsis On a mission to find his mystery maiden by finding a matching bra for the panties, Matthew becomes the maintenance man of the virgin vault. After releasing mice, he goes room to room, setting traps. He convinces the panicked women to leave their rooms and then starts to look for a match. When he is unsuccessful, he continues to break things  in an effort to find his woman. He also fixes the television set, which is greatly received by women he refers to as "Jane-ites", as they have a great interest in films adapted from books by Jane Austen. He doesn\'t get much help from his roommate Rod , who keeps telling him to give up, and together they philosophize about men and women. Rod tells him that he doesn\'t need a girlfriend and that it\'s futile to try to find the "bra matching the panties", and Matthew accuses him of being too machismo. Rod introduces Matthew to the "penile power", which involves the use of weights attached to his penis as a means of increasing the organ\'s size. He does this and insults women to make himself feel better about the problem he has with his manhood; he suffers from hypospadias, a condition in which the urethra opens on the underside of the penis rather than at the tip of the glans. Early on, Matthew watches as a woman named Patty  and her boyfriend Crick fight. Crick is the epitome of the macho man stereotype, with his big pectorals, conceited attitude, and abusiveness. He wears a pony-tail, a manicured goatee, "male make-up", and chews nicotine gum, much to Matthew\'s dismay. Matthew tries to save Patty, but is hurt by Crick. Crick leaves, and Patty tries to help Matthew, but Matthew can\'t help but think of Patty\'s reputation as a "slut." While searching one room, Matthew finds himself trapped in the bathroom when the occupant returns. Matthew is attacked by Wendy , until she recognizes him as a high school classmate.

Matthew puts an advertisement in the school newspaper asking the girl he\'s seeking to meet him in the basement on a Thursday night. He sits in the dark every Thursday night, waiting for her to show up. The door opens one night, and he thinks it\'s her, but it\'s Wendy, coming to check up on him. Finally, the mystery maiden does show up, only to tell him to stop looking for her. Despite the approach of the end of the semester, Matthew isn\'t deterred. He disguises himself in drag, as Francesca, as a means to continue his search. In drag, he is actually able to talk to Cynthia one on one which, , he is not able to do because he is intimidated by her good looks. Rod flirts with Francesca and later brags to Matthew that he had sex with Francesca. This makes Matthew so angry that he adds another weight onto Rod\'s "penile power" device, hurting him. Crick makes a pass at Matthew in drag while he fights with Patty. Matthew bites off part of Crick\'s tongue. As a result, Crick is unable to speak without lisping. Desperation sets in, so Matthew appeals to his mystery maiden by proclaiming his love for her to the whole dormitory. He finally determines his mystery maiden is Patty. She initially rejects him because she thought that he would see her only as a slut. Crick sees that Matthew wants Patty, but Matthew has him arrested for sexually assaulting him . Matthew introduces Rod and Dora, and Arlene and Wendy hook up. Cynthia shows off her newly found martial art abilities, and Ms. Stern learns a valuable lesson on gender equality, as Matthew stands up to her in front of the class, to an ovation.

Eric meets up with him, and they have a brief conversation, which ends when Alex shoots Eric in mid-sentence.

The film follows the fate of two boys, Pinki and Švaba, growing up in Novi Beograd during the 1991-1996 period. Pinki was born on 4 May 1980, the day Yugoslav president Josip Broz Tito died, and was given his unusual name by his father Stojan Mučibabić, an idealistic, impulsive, and patriotic officer of the Yugoslav People\'s Army  who is deeply devoted to communist ideals and Marshal Tito. Father\'s first choice for his firstborn\'s name was actually Tito, but the officials at the municipal office thought it provocative and inappropriate in the time of grieving so he eventually settled on Pinki after local communist Partisan fighter. Meanwhile, Pinki\'s best friend Švaba is raised and cared for only by his grandmother, Serb from Croatia who escaped to Serbia during World War II after persecution from the Croatian fascist movement Ustaše. Living in the block of apartment buildings in Novi Beograd\'s neighbourhood of Paviljoni, both kids are extremely juvenile, though Pinki is a bit more thoughtful and articulate while Švaba is moody, impulsive, and prone to anger outbursts. The duo also has another friend in the neighbourhood — Dijabola, an eager, geeky, and bespectacled outsider whose sexy and aloof mother Lidija is a well-known television host. Though they hang out with him, Pinki and Švaba mostly treat Dijabola poorly. He is constantly the butt of their insults and occasionally even gets beaten up by them. The story begins in the late summer of 1991 as the kids watch Serbian troops  going off to war in neighbouring Croatia where the Battle of Vukovar is raging. Pinki\'s father Stojan is extremely frustrated about being forced into early retirement by the JNA army and thus missing the chance to go to war. He spends his days glued to the television set, watching news reports from Vukovar and cheering on the JNA. By now he has transformed into a nationalist and has become extremely irritable, getting into petty quarrels with neighbours and venting his anger along the ethnic and political lines. He has also found a new idol - instead of Tito he\'s now a huge supporter of Slobodan Milošević. Pinki, for his part, is mostly oblivious to the events around him as he spends most of his time compulsively masturbating. By 1992 and 1993, Serbia is under a UN trade embargo, and the war has spread from Croatia to Bosnia as well. Entering their early teens, Pinki, Švaba and Dijabola begin their fascination with a neighbour across the street Kure who drives a nice car, makes regular robbing excursions to Germany while dating a trashy kafana singer. They\'re deeply impressed with his swagger and lifestyle and are ecstatic one day when he invites them to unload his car that\'s full of stuff he brought over from Germany. In fact, he sends Dijabola away and picks only Švaba, but then upon Švaba\'s suggestion tells Pinki to come along as well. Like many of their peers, Pinki and Švaba enter the world of crime at fourteen years of age in an ex-communist community that is in hyper-transition, which, because of war and sanctions, reminds the two friends of a theater of the absurd. The idols of the main characters are famous Belgrade gangsters and a TV show called Puls Asfalta  which features criminals and turns them into media stars. Pinki and Švaba fantasize of being on the show one day and they attempt to be noticed by its producers by committing crimes. After they succeed in establishing themselves as influential criminals and drug dealers, their uprising in the world of crime is cut by mutual conflict. Švaba shoots Pinki five times in the same places that Jesus was wounded two thousand years ago. Pinki manages to survive and after some time he escapes from the hospital, and calls his friend to make peace. The truce is more than terrible, as the wounded boy has, after an unwritten rule, to inflict five identical wounds to his friend, so the friendship can be rebuilt. After shooting Švaba three times, he considers wounding him one more time instead of the required two. They are suddenly interrupted by a furious Dijabola who shoots at them, especially Švaba, for killing his mother. A shootout occurs and Švaba and Dijabola are killed. In the end, Pinki, who is wounded and is lying on the ground, laughs at the audience by claiming that he "made out better than you."'] ['Mild-mannered teen Jim "Jimmy" Wilson  appears before a judge on charges of manslaughter. When asked to speak in his own defense, Jim pauses and reflects to say, "I accuse my parents" for not giving him the home life he should have had. The film flashes back to a day in high school when Jim was given an award for an essay describing the ideal home he supposedly has. Eager to tell his parents, he goes home to a house full of empty alcohol bottles and parents distracted by arguing with each other. Jim is embarrassed when his mother  shows up drunk to the graduation planning committee. Later, his father  gives him money instead of celebrating his birthday with him. Jim gets a job selling shoes after school and meets torch singer Kitty Reed . He delivers a pair of shoes to her house and then meets her later at the nightclub where she works. The two begin dating, Jim unaware that Kitty is also the moll of gangster Charles Blake , who specializes in fencing stolen jewelry. Blake identifies Jimmy as sufficiently gullible and recruits him to deliver packages and messages after work and school. Jim gets paid highly for his errands, so he never questions what exactly he is delivering. Charles forces Kitty to break up with Jimmy after he realizes that their relationship is becoming serious. Shortly afterward, Jim drives two of Charlie\'s henchmen to a late-night "errand," which turns out to be a robbery where a night watchman is shot. Realizing what he\'s gotten involved in, Jimmy turns to his father, who ignores him. Jimmy confronts Blake himself, but Blake threatens to kill him if he doesn\'t continue working for him. Later, after the police identify Jimmy as the driver of the getaway car, Blake sends his men to kill Jimmy, but the execution is interrupted by a couple who stumbles upon the scene, causing the men to flee and leave behind a wounded Jimmy. Fearing for his life, Jimmy packs a suitcase and spends an indeterminate amount of time hitchhiking and train-hopping. He eventually ends up in a small town where he attempts to rob a diner, but the kindly owner, Al ([[George Lloyd , recognizes Jimmy as a good boy in a bad situation and offers him safe harbor and a job, as long as he agrees to give up crime and start going to church. After a period of living and working for Al, Jimmy\'s life straightens up and he confesses to his crimes. Al agrees to accompany Jimmy back home to turn himself in. Back in Jimmy\'s hometown, Al takes him to confront Kitty, who confesses that she was forced to break up with him. Jimmy then goes to confront Blake one more time, in the hopes that Blake will also turn himself in to help clear Jimmy\'s name. Blake refuses and instead pulls a gun on Jimmy; Jimmy attempts to wrestle the gun away, accidentally shooting and killing Blake in the process. The police, alerted by Al, storm Blake\'s hideout and arrest his men, along with Jimmy. Back in the present, the judge, understanding why Jimmy accuses his parents, acquits Jimmy of manslaughter. However, the judge also finds him guilty on charges of possession of stolen property and gives him a five year suspended sentence and two years probation and remands him to the custody of his parents until he is twenty-one. The judge then addresses Jimmy\'s parents , warning that any young man could suffer the same fate as Jimmy if left to neglectful parents.

Needy and popular cheerleader Jennifer Check  have been best friends since childhood, despite having little in common. One night, Jennifer takes Needy to a local dive bar to attend a concert by indie rock band Low Shoulder. A suspicious fire engulfs the bar, killing several, and Jennifer agrees to leave with the band despite Needy\'s attempts to stop her. Later that evening, Jennifer, covered in blood, appears in Needy\'s kitchen and proceeds to eat food from the refrigerator. Unable to digest the matter, she vomits a trail of black, spiny fluid and then leaves in a hurry as Needy calls after her. The next morning at school, Jennifer appears fine and shrugs off Needy\'s concerns. While the small town is devastated by the deaths caused by the fire, Jennifer seduces the school\'s football captain in the woods and then attacks him; his disemboweled corpse is later found. Meanwhile, the members of Low Shoulder gain popularity due to their rumored heroism during the fire and offer to make a charity appearance at the school\'s spring formal. A month later, Jennifer is beginning to look pale, and accepts a date with school goth/emo Colin , whom she brutally kills that night. While Needy and her boyfriend, Chip  have sex, Needy senses something dreadful has happened. She leaves in a panic and almost runs over Jennifer, drenched in blood. She rushes home and finds Jennifer in her bedroom, who then begins to make out with Needy and soon explains what happened after the fire: Low Shoulder took her into the woods and offered her as a virgin sacrifice to Satan in exchange for fame and fortune. However, although the sacrifice and greedy exchange were a success, Jennifer was not a virgin, and when the lead singer Nikolai  murdered her, a demonic spirit took over her body. It is revealed then that Jennifer knew she needed human flesh and blood to survive. In addition to the known murdered townspeople, Jennifer also encountered the exchange student Ahmet after the fire and upon hearing that no one knew he had survived, she took him into the woods and ate him, making him her first victim. The next day at school, as the town is stunned by Colin\'s death, Needy goes to the school library\'s occult section and surmises that Jennifer is a succubus; she is weakest when she is hungry, and must eat flesh in order to sustain her life and appearance. Needy tells Chip about her discoveries and warns him not to attend the dance. He does not believe her and she subsequently breaks up with him in order to protect him. Chip goes to the dance, hoping to meet with Needy, but is instead intercepted by Jennifer, who seduces him and takes him to an abandoned pool house. Needy arrives there and finds Jennifer feeding on Chip. Needy tries to drown Jennifer but Jennifer, hovering in the air, attacks her. She is then stabbed by Chip with a pool skimmer.

Culminating with a stab to the heart, Needy finally destroys the demon and kills her. Jennifer\'s mother  comes in and finds Needy with the utility knife on top of her daughter\'s body. Soon after, Needy is brought to an asylum. Since she was bitten by Jennifer, she has obtained some of Jennifer\'s supernatural powers. Set upon revenge for what was done to Jennifer and her, she escapes the mental facility and hitchhikes a ride to the hotel where Low Shoulder are staying; she then brutally murders them all.'] [' The Power Rangers, Adam , Kimberly , Billy , Aisha , Rocky  and Tommy  participate with Bulk and Skull in a charity sky dive for Angel Grove in anticipation of Ryan\'s Comet which will be passing near the planet in two days. After the Rangers jump, Bulk and Skull finally work up the nerve to dive as well, landing in the middle of a construction site in midtown. Before they are admonished the construction workers are distracted by a giant egg that had been uncovered where they were digging. The unearthing of this egg alerts Zordon who contacts the Rangers; he explains that 6,000 years ago he tricked a shapeshifting being known as Ivan Ooze by trapping him in the egg and buried it to prevent him from taking over the universe. He sends them to recover the egg before it is opened, but Rita Repulsa, Lord Zedd, Goldar, and Mordant find the egg and release Ivan before the Rangers arrive. Ivan summons several subordinate "oozelings" on the Rangers. While the Rangers are busy defeating them, Ivan infiltrates the Command Center and destroys its equipment, incapacitating Alpha and sending Zordon outside of the timewarp tube that keeps him alive as a result. With the destruction of the Command Center having disabled the Rangers\' morphing powers, Alpha sends them to the planet Phaedos in search of a greater power to defeat Ivan and save Zordon. After they leave, Ivan traps Rita and Zedd in a snowglobe; not wanting to meet the same fate, Goldar and Mordant submit to him. Ivan decides to recruit the parents of Angel Grove to dig up his Ectomorphicon Titans, massive zord-like machines that were buried long ago. Disguising himself as a carnival wizard, Ivan gives out free jars of ooze to the children of Angel Grove, one of whom is a young friend of the rangers Fred Kelman . Fred\'s father discovers the ooze, which promptly hypnotizes him, along with the rest of the parents, into working for Ivan. Fred discovers this and follows the parents to uncover Ivan\'s intentions. Meanwhile, the Rangers arrive at a plateau on Phaedos and after facing an attack from Ivan\'s minions, the Tengoo, they meet Dulcea  a warrior who wants to help Zordon by leading the Rangers to the great power. She teaches them to harness their animal spirits, and directs them to a monolith which houses the power. The Rangers overcome many deadly obstacles and uncover the power along with new zords to match their animal spirits. With their power restored, they return to Earth to face Ivan. Having restored his Ectomorphicon machines, Ivan orders the parents to leap to their deaths at the construction site; Fred recruits the now-parentless kids to help him save them. The Rangers arrive and summon their zords to stop the Ectomorphicons, saving the kids who are nearly killed in a monorail derailment allowing them to continue their mission as the Rangers battle Ivan\'s machines. When they destroy one of his two machines, Ivan merges with the other becoming a massive robotic version of himself. The Rangers form the Ninja Megazord, but are heavily outmatched in the fight. Billy suggests they drag Ivan into the path of Ryan\'s Comet to destroy him. They form the Ninja Falcon Megazord and trick Ivan into chasing them into space and with a trick maneuver from Aisha, they are able to safely avoid the explosion when the comet destroys Ivan. His destruction reverses the hypnotic effects of the ooze, and the parents, who have been stalled by Fred, Bulk and Skull, and the other kids, are saved. The Rangers return to the Command Center where they learn that Zordon had died. Tommy suggests using their powers to revive him, and they are able to do so, restoring the Command Center and his timewarp tube all at the same time. In a celebratory festival, Bulk and Skull are offended that the Power Rangers are given credit for saving the city yet again even though they legitimately had a part in helping to save lives, but their embellished tales only lead to laughter from the teens. Meanwhile, in Rita and Lord Zedd\'s Moon Base, Goldar decides to proclaim himself "King Goldar, The Ruler of the Universe" but when Rita and Lord Zedd enter the chamber, growling at their turncoat behavior, Goldar and Mordant look at each other in shock.'] ["The film chronicles nerdy high school senior Danny Stein ([[Steven Kaplan  and his unsuccessful attempts to secure a prom date while his divorced father and mother  are on their own unsuccessful quests to find love.

They all failed and have to go to summer school for remedial English. The original remedial English teacher  wins the lottery and immediately quits work. Gills has no choice but to give the job to Shoop. Gills implies that not taking the job could keep him from getting tenure. On the first day, Shoop meets Robin Bishop , who is teaching next door. Shoop falls head over heels for her, but she is already dating Gills. Shoop\'s first day is a disaster. Most of the students ditch and one, Jerome , goes to the lavatory and doesn\'t return.

After the leftover students attempt to ditch as well, Shoop admits he has no idea how to teach. They spend their first few days having fun and going to the beach, a theme park and the petting zoo until Gills finds out. Gills threatens to fire Shoop unless his students pass the end-of-term test.

Larry is fired from his stripper job when he is found out first by his aunt  and then by his mother . The students make more demands on Shoop and he quits his job in anger. He is then convinced to come back when his students start feeling guilty about what they did and they scare off Shoop\'s replacement with a series of stunts eerily reminiscent of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. Shoop and his students then begin preparing for the test in earnest. The student who "went to the lavatory" finally returns, with his only explanation being, "My zipper got stuck." He ends up getting the highest score in the class with a 91. The exam goes smoothly despite Rhonda going into labor near the end . Not all pass, so Gills is ready to follow through with his firing threat. However, the parents of the students come to Shoop\'s defense. Because of the students\' great improvement, Principal Kelban  grants Shoop tenure for his positive effect. Shoop and Robin end up happily together; a la From Here to Eternity, they kiss in the surf.'] ["Billie is a 15-year-old girl who is not like every other teen.

Unscrupulous news anchor Robert Campbell, who is dating Jessica, enters and reveals on a phone call that he stole Diana\'s body, planted it in the house to be revealed during an upcoming investigative show to boost his ratings. Jason bursts in and possesses Robert and then leaves with Steven in pursuit. Jessica, who is unaware that her boyfriend is the undead killer, is attacked by him so he can be reborn through her but is disrupted by Steven, who manages to stop him and get Jessica into a car. He runs over Jason and explains the situation, but Jessica does not believe him and throws him out of the car and goes to the police. Steven turns himself into police and arrives at the station as Jason does; he frees himself again to protect Jessica, who now realizes that Duke was telling the truth. In the chaos, Duke makes his escape. The two make their way to the diner where Diana worked and where baby Stephanie is. As they do, Jason arrives and a violent melee ensues leaving much of the staff dead and Jason presumably so. Jessica and Steven discover a note from Duke, telling them that he has the baby and ordering Jessica to meet him at the Voorhees house alone. Jessica meets Duke at the Voorhees house. Duke throws her a knife, and when she catches it, the knife turns into a mystical dagger which can be used to permanently kill Jason. Meanwhile, Steven\'s friend Randy a police officer, is attacked by Robert at the diner. Back at the house, Duke falls through the floor, and Jessica is confronted by two police officers. One is killed accidentally with the dagger, and Jessica drops it under a dresser. The second is revealed to be Jason, and attempts to be reborn through Stephanie, but Steven arrives and severs his neck with a machete. The creature crawls out of Randy\'s neck, and makes its way to the basement, where Diana\'s body was planted. As Steven, Jessica, and Duke realize what is happening, as Jason can be reborn from any Voorhees relative, alive or dead, Jason explodes through the floor in his classic form. As Jessica attempts to retrieve the dagger the two men alternately fight with Jason. Duke is killed when Jason snaps his back in a bear hug, the fight between Jason and Steven ends up outside in a yard. As Jason prepares to kill Steven, Jessica jumps behind him and stabs him in the chest. This releases the tortured souls of Jason\'s victims into Heaven as light is shined upon him.

In addition to Veronica, the popular clique consists of three wealthy and beautiful  girls with the same first name: the malicious leader, Heather Chandler ([[Kim Walker ; the bookish bulimic Heather Duke  and the weak-willed cheerleader Heather McNamara . These three rule Westerburg through cruelty. Though they are the most "popular" students, the Heathers are feared and hated. Veronica has had enough of their shallow behavior and longs to return to her old life and her nerdy friends. When a new student, a rebellious outsider named Jason Dean , or J.D. for short, pulls a gun on school bullies Kurt Kelly  and Ram Sweeney  and fires blanks at them, Veronica finds herself fascinated with him. Veronica attends a frat party with Heather Chandler; when Veronica refuses sex and throws up spiked punch, Heather vows to destroy her reputation. J.D. shows up at Veronica\'s house and after some flirting they end up having sex outside, after which Veronica tells J.D. she wants to make Heather Chandler puke her guts out. The next morning, Veronica and J.D. break into The Chandler home. J.D. serves Heather a liquid he claims is a hangover cure but is actually drain cleaner, killing her. J.D. urges Veronica to forge a dramatic suicide note in Heather Chandler\'s handwriting. The school and community look on Heather Chandler\'s apparent suicide as a tragic but admirable decision made by a popular but sadly troubled teenager. Heather Duke soon steps into Heather Chandler\'s former role as clique leader and begins wearing a red scrunchie that had belonged to Chandler. Several days later, the oafish Kurt and Ram spread a false rumor about Veronica giving oral sex to them at the same time during a double date with Heather McNamara, ruining her reputation at school. J.D. proposes that Veronica lure them into the woods behind the school with the promise to "make the rumors true"; then shoot them with "special" nonfatal German World War II bullets. J.D. offers to plant materials beside the other boys suggesting they were homosexuals, as well as a suicide note stating the two were lovers participating in a suicide pact. Ram is shot but Veronica misses Kurt, who runs away. J.D. chases Kurt back towards Veronica, who panics and shoots him. The next day, J.D. and Veronica wake up in J.D\'s car and Veronica, realising that the bullets were real, intentionally burns herself on the car\'s cigarette lighter. J.D. accuses Veronica of knowing that the bullets were real, which she denies loudly as the argument descends into childishness, with Veronica and J.D. screaming \'Did not/did too\' at each other, as the Heathers look on. At their funeral, the boys are made into martyrs against homophobia. Although she keeps dating J.D., Veronica is alarmed by his behavior and his relationship with his father ; she also learns that J.D.\'s mother may have killed herself to escape his father. Martha Dunnstock, an obese, regularly bullied student known as "Martha Dumptruck", pins a suicide note to her chest and walks into traffic.

Veronica tells J.D. that she will not participate in any more killings. He climbs into her room with a revolver to kill her, but Veronica instead tricks J.D., having used a harness to make it look like she has hanged herself. Thinking she is dead, he rambles about his plan to blow up the entire school during a pep rally. A petition he has been circulating via Heather Duke, to get the band Big Fun to perform on campus was actually a disguised mass suicide note. Most of the students had already signed, so the mass murder would appear to be a mass suicide instead. Veronica confronts J.D. in the boiler room, where he is rigging timed explosives. She shoots him when he refuses to stop the bomb. As J.D. collapses, he stabs the timer and it stops. Veronica walks out through the pep rally with everyone cheering, unaware there is still a bomb under the bleachers.

Alexia\'s  days revolve around being popular, dressing stylishly, and spending time with her jock boyfriend, while exerting minimal effort academically. Hayley  is socially reserved, admiring her older sister\'s popularity from a distance while excelling in her studies, particularly science and math. Hayley and Alexia don\'t get along well at all, with Hayley resenting her reliance on her frequently late sister for a ride to school and Alexia preferring not to be seen with her less-than-cool younger sister. One night, Hayley is outside studying the night sky for her science class, while Alexia relaxes in the outdoor hot tub with her boyfriend, Kyle . When Hayley sees a shooting star, she wishes aloud to become her sister Alexia, then turns to see Alexia also watching the sky. The two of them awaken the next morning to find themselves trapped in each other\'s body. Hayley assumes responsibility for the swap, mentioning her wish. Distraught, Alexia forbids Hayley to go to school in her place, and she instigates a variety of wish-making attempts for Hayley to reverse their condition, all of which are unsuccessful. Hayley is content to fill her sister\'s role for the day, as she can now experience the glamor of Alexia\'s life firsthand. After the first day ends, they realize that they may be stuck like this for a while. They each spend the next few days purposely trying to ruin anything important to the other, such as their social reputation and extra-curricular activities. One day, Hayley  wears the same outfit that she had worn the day before, and Alexia  goes to school dressed up as a dominatrix. Their parents choose not to interfere, as they had just started a "hands-off" approach to parenting. Eventually, however, Hayley and Alexia learn to look at their lives with new perspective. As they each become accustomed to the other\'s life, they begin to relate to one another better and become closer as sisters. While spending an evening outside searching for a shooting star to make their wish to switch back, they decide to spend one more day as each other. Hayley\'s task  is to help convince her teachers that Alexia is not an "airhead," and Alexia  is to help show Hayley how easily Hayley can get a guy. Hayley\'s and Alexia\'s plans work, and they decide that it\'s time for them to switch back. As they lay outside watching for a shooting star, they fall asleep early; Hayley wakes up during the night in time to wish on a star. When she awakens the next morning, she finds that they didn\'t switch back and believes that they will never be able to return to their own bodies, but she doesn\'t tell Alexia. Alexia and Hayley attend the Winter Festival dance, where Hayley breaks down and tells Alexia that they can\'t switch back. Alexia then confesses that she saw the first shooting star when she was with Kyle and wished to be Hayley, since she had been jealous of Hayley\'s intellect and well-structured plans for her future. Realizing that it was their combined wishing that caused their switch, they sit outside and, seeing a shooting star, wish together to be themselves again. Opening their eyes, they are delighted to see their wish has come true. They return to the Winter Festival, where Alexia is crowned queen. She then dances on stage with her boyfriend, while Hayley finds their new neighbor Simon and dances with him.'] ['The film begins with a video presentation of a top-secret project called "Crossbow": a high tech space shuttle mounted with a computer-guided laser weapon that is shown to incinerate a man on the ground with pinpoint accuracy. The film ends and a group of CIA agents discuss the project, noting that the researchers developing the laser have not yet been able to generate the power needed. It is also stated that it has no wartime applications and is designed solely for illegal assassinations. One agent has moral qualms about this and quits the program. It is strongly implied that this agent is himself assassinated. Meanwhile, Professor Jerry Hathaway  meets up with fifteen year old genius Mitch Taylor . Hathaway lets him know that he\'s been admitted to Pacific Tech, and also that he\'ll be rooming and working with with physics "legend" Chris Knight on Dr. Hathaway\'s laser project. We later learn that Hathaway is the researcher contracted by the CIA to develop the laser weapon, and that instead of doing the research himself, he\'s subbed the job out to his students and used his funding to remodel his house. Arriving on campus, Mitch meets Chris and is surprised and bit irritated to learn that Chris, while brilliant, is also an irreverent slacker who spends his time constructing elaborate pranks, such as freezing the dorm floors to go ice skating. Mitch also meets Jordan , a hyperkinetic female student with whom he falls in love, and the mysterious Lazlo Hollyfeld , who seems to live in Chris and Mitch\'s dorm room closet. Hathaway\'s subservient graduate assistant Kent , becomes hostile when Hathaway puts Mitch in charge of the project. Hathaway, under increasing pressure from the CIA to get results, cracks down on Chris, giving him an unrealistic timetable. Chris dismisses this, and increasingly distracts Mitch from his work. After Hathaway brutally scolds Mitch for joining Chris\'s pool party and Kent records Mitch\'s tearful telephone call to his mother and plays it over the cafeteria PA system at lunchtime, Mitch is ready to quit. Chris convinces him to stay by telling him of Lazlo\'s story: He was the top genius at Pacific Tech until he learned of the misuse of his theories and became a recluse, living in the steam tunnels under the dorm behind a secret passageway in the closet. Chris tells Mitch that if he doesn\'t want to crack, he needs to learn to have fun, and the first order of business is to get even with Kent. The two disassemble Kent\'s car and reassemble it in his dorm room, much to his horror. Hathaway, now nearly desperate to show the CIA some progress, berates Chris and lets him know that no matter what he does, he will be flunked out of school. Chris, with encouragement from Mitch decides to not only fix the power problem, but also to ace Hathaway\'s exam. His efforts appear to be ruined when Kent sabotages the laser, but, in a fit of anger at the laser\'s destruction, he has an epiphany that solves the project\'s power problem. The beam of the redesigned laser is "hotter than the sun", has an unlimited range and produces the required five megawatts of power. Hathaway forgives Chris completely. When the laser team celebrate their success, Laslo shows up, having overheard Chris\'s solution, and points out that the high-energy laser can only be used as a weapon, and in fact that it must have been conceptualized for this purpose. Chris is devastated. In the research lab, Hathaway has removed both the laser and a tracking system to aim it . Their first step is to implant a radio transceiver in Kent\'s braces. Posing as Jesus, Mitch tricks Kent into revealing that the laser is going to be tested soon. The group tail Hathaway to a nearby Air Force base. While Chris and Mitch talk their way into the base, Laslo remotely cracks the laser\'s computer and changes its target coordinates to Hathaway\'s house, where the gang have placed a huge tin of popcorn. They call the Dean and the local congressman to witness the weapon firing, and Mitch, as Jesus, orders Kent to visit the house. When the laser hits the house, it shines through a stained-glass window and Kent becomes convinced that he is having a religious experience. The popcorn heats and expands, the house bursts at the seams, and popcorn pours out, pushing Kent along with it into the street. Meanwhile, the laser overheats and destroys itself. Lazlo states his intention to get married and retire to the midwest while the rest of the group watch as Dr. Hathaway\'s newly destroyed house is ransacked by kids playing in the popcorn. The final shot during the credits shows Hathaway pulling up to his house and seeing the damage up close.'] ['Jane Coslaw , the narrator of the film, is the oldest sister in a dysfunctional family of four. Her narration centers on her strained relationship with her younger, paraplegic brother Marty  and their parents Nan and Bob. Their rocky relationship changes after a series of murders in their small rural town of Tarker\'s Mills, Maine. First, a railroad worker, Arnie Westrum , is killed by a werewolf. The county coroner believes that Arnie passed out on the railroad tracks and was run over by a train. Soon after, a local woman, Stella Randolph , prepares to commit suicide because she is unmarried and pregnant. Before she can act, she is murdered. This murder goes unsolved and the townsfolk become worried. The next victim, Milt Sturmfuller , whose daughter is Marty\'s girlfriend, hears a racket in his shed. Believing teenagers are making mischief, Sturmfuller plans to scare them off with a shotgun. Instead, he encounters the werewolf and is killed. His family leaves town. Next to die is teenager Brady Kincaid , Marty\'s best friend, who stayed out too late one night while flying a kite. After Brady\'s death, citizens led by local gun shop owner Andy Fairton  form a vigilante justice group. Although local Sheriff Joe Haller  and his lone deputy  attempt to stop the citizens, the officers relent after being berated by Brady\'s father . In the middle of the melee, Baptist Reverend Lester Lowe  attempts to prevent the townsfolk from causing further bloodshed. After the vigilantes go out hunting for the killer, several are attacked and killed, including Owen Knopfler . The survivors later deny seeing anything unusual. After the vigilantes are attacked, Reverend Lowe dreams that he is presiding over a mass funeral when his congregation -- including the dead bodies in the caskets -- begins to transform into werewolves before his eyes. He awakes and asks God to "let it end." As a result of the mounting unsolved murders, curfews are put in place and the annual fair and fireworks show is canceled. The Coslaws decide to have their own backyard party and invite Nan\'s alcoholic black sheep brother, Uncle Red . Red builds a wheelchair/motorcycle for his nephew, which he nicknames the "Silver Bullet". He also gives Marty a pile of fireworks so that he can have his own celebration. Marty uses the Silver Bullet to go out in the middle of the night to a small bridge where he lights the fireworks. Marty is confronted by the werewolf and barely escapes with his life by launching a rocket into the left eye of the creature. Marty enlists Jane\'s help to look for someone with a newly injured or missing left eye. The search is conducted under the cover of the church\'s bottle drive, so as not to arouse suspicion. When Jane turns her bottles in, she discovers that Reverend Lowe is missing his left eye. Realizing that no adult would believe his fantastic story, Marty begins sending anonymous notes to Reverend Lowe telling him that he knows who he is, what he is, and that he should commit suicide in order to stop the killings. A cat-and-mouse chase ensues between the Reverend and the siblings. At one point Lowe tries to run Marty, who is driving the Silver Bullet, off the road with his car. When Marty is trapped under a closed covered bridge, Lowe, who has more or less gone insane, uses Judeo-Christian logic to rationalize the murders he has committed: he cites Randolph\'s murder during her suicide attempt as his effort to save her soul ; Westrum was a severe alcoholic; he implies that Sturmfuller was abusing his wife and possibly his daughter ; and the vigilantes intended to murder someone in cold blood . Lowe then apologizes and tells Marty that he is going to drown him in the river when Marty is unwittingly saved by local farmer Elmer Zinneman. The siblings tell Red about their letter-writing campaign to Reverend Lowe. After calming down the furious Red, they manage to convince him that Lowe is connected to the murders and attempted to kill Marty: The Silver Bullet has dents and a scrape of blue paint that matches Lowe\'s car. Unable to deny the evidence in front of him, Red heads straight to Sheriff Haller. Although Red admits that he has his doubts, and Haller does not believe Lowe to be a killer, Red nonetheless persuades the sheriff to investigate. That night, Haller, still skeptical but desperate to find the killer, is shocked to discover evidence that at least some of Marty\'s story may be true. Haller finds Lowe, who has locked himself in his garage, but before Haller can arrest him, Lowe transforms and kills Haller. Marty and Jane realize that with Haller out of the way, the werewolf now has an easy path to come after them. They convince Red to take Jane\'s silver cross and Marty\'s silver medallion and melt it down into a silver bullet. Under the guise of Marty having just "discovered the Lone Ranger", Red has a local gunsmith make the bullet, after which, while admiring his handiwork, the gunsmith tells Red that the bullet should have no problem killing a werewolf. On Halloween, Red shows up at the Coslaws with some fortuitous news: He has won a romantic getaway to New York, but since he got separated from his wife, he gives the tickets to Nan and Bob. Questioned by Marty and Jane, Red reveals that he bought the tickets as a ruse to get their parents to safety. With the now full moon in the sky, they head inside to wait for the werewolf. Despite their best efforts, the trio fall asleep and are startled when Red  burns himself and drops the gun, nearly setting it off. Jane screams in horror  as she sees the werewolf looking at her from the living room window, although when Red looks he finds nothing. Red begins to doubt that the werewolf is real, much less going to show up, and orders Marty and Jane to bed. The werewolf meanwhile cuts the power to the house, leaving the trio in darkness. The werewolf then smashes into the house, attacking Red, Marty and Jane. Despite Red\'s best efforts he is overpowered by the werewolf and tossed around like a rag doll. Marty manages to find the bullet  and shoots the werewolf in the right eye with the silver bullet, killing him. The corpse turns back into Reverend Lowe, and Marty and Jane realize that the ordeal has strengthened their love for each other.'] ['On graduation day at Buffalo Glenn High School in Tacoma, Washington, valedictorian Denis Cooverman  confesses his love for head cheerleader and long time crush, Beth Cooper  in his speech while also taunting a girl, Valli Wooley , with an eating disorder, an ignorant bully, Beth\'s Army soldier boyfriend Kevin ; and urging his best friend Rich Munsch ([[Jack Carpenter  to admit he is gay.

Denis informs Rich that he was just playing about waiting until the reunion to talk to Beth again. He tells Rich that he is going to leave Beth a message on Facebook and ask her out.

He sees the girl he likes, and his bandmates try to get him to sing to her and ask her out. He becomes nervous, ends up seeing himself naked in front of everyone, and faints. Fast-forward 7 years, and Kevin\'s in advertising. He makes a pitch for Reebok that gets shot down. The pitch is later used in the meeting by his "partner" Jackie  who presents it as hers at the last minute. As he takes the train home from work, he meets Abbey . They hit it off talking about their similar interests . As they go their separate ways, they hesitate but eventually leave. They each go home and discuss the encounter with their friends. He decides to try to find Abbey by making posters and placing them all over town. He goes out with a few random women who answer the call, none of which are Abbey. The local newspaper finds out about his search and sets up an interview. The reporter, Brady Frances , is an old classmate who hates him; in high school Brady asked a girl out to prom and she promptly asked Kevin who was standing nearby, then returned to Brady and said she was taken. The article comes out in the paper and Kevin gets hundreds of calls, which leads to his dateless roommates — aspiring musician Rod ; Eric ([[GQ ; and art nut Randy  — suggesting they date all the callers to help. Eric has the idea shot down when he originally pitches it to Kevin, but while Kevin is at work one day, Eric calls and asks him to reconsider. It is poor timing, as Kevin is having a conversation with his boss, Higgins . When he gives a "Yes" answer to a question from Higgins, Eric hears him on the other end of the line, and hangs up. A follow up article comes out in which Brady presents Kevin as a loser, which makes even more girls call. Brady gets more upset when his girlfriend Julie ([[Amanda Foreman , who is rather bothered by his still-intense grudge against Kevin, takes Kevin\'s side. While the search is going on Abbey is having problems with her boyfriend of 3 years, whom she was visiting when she met Kevin. Her boyfriend buys tickets to an Al Green concert and flakes out on her. Kevin is also at the concert but they never see each other, despite several close calls. Soon, Eric, Rod, and Randy begin taking calls from many girls, and going on dates with them, for their own enjoyment  and to find Abbey. One of the girls is actually Abbey, who gets mad when she finds out Kevin\'s friends are taking the dates. Another girl who answers the call is Brady\'s girlfriend, Julie. When she tells him the friends are answering the calls and dating the girls Brady writes another article declaring the scam. At work, Reebok decides they won\'t work with Kevin once the article comes out and he is taken off the project, even though it was his idea. After work Kevin sees Abbey waiting for the train. He tries to get her attention but she doesn\'t see him till she\'s getting on the train. He runs to get on but the doors close. As he knocks on her window she smacks the paper with the headline "Train Man Scam" against the window as the train pulls away. He talks to Eric about it and Eric finally tells him she did answer the call and they went out. Kevin punches Eric and leaves. His friends, who feel guilty about the whole situation, decide to search for Abbey themselves. They put up their own posters, with a hand drawn image of her, and ride the train for days. At first people aren\'t interested in helping, until Eric makes a speech about being in love, ending it with, "Love may not make the world go \'round, but it\'s what makes the ride worthwhile." He gets a standing ovation from everyone on the train except Abbey, sitting in stunned silence behind the other passengers. Things continue going downhill when Kevin learns his best friend at the agency, Nathan , suffers a heart attack. Kevin goes to see Nathan at a rehab facility, where Nathan tells him the story of both meeting his wife at a Chicago Cubs game, and catching a home run from Cubs legend Ernie Banks the same day, and how the two tied together. He gives Kevin the baseball and tells him to try to find Abbey again. Things soon start going uphill for Kevin. For starters, he is put back on the ad campaign project . He gets put in charge of the billboards for the ad, and changes it to an apology for Abbey asking her to meet him at the station at 7. The billboard is all over town and the media wait with him at the scheduled time. After 15 minutes of Abbey not showing up, the TV crews start packing up and the spectators begin to disperse, but all stop when Kevin picks up a paper airplane thrown by Abbey telling him to look up. Kevin races up a flight of stairs to a breezeway over the tracks, where he asks Abbey for her name, and number. Abbey responds with, "Abbey, and I\'d thought you\'d never ask." They then kiss, much to the delight of the crowd at the station, and to the television viewers at home, and in a bar where his roommates are watching. Life also gets better for Rod and Randy. Randy meets a girl at the bar while watching Kevin\'s meeting with Abbey, and finds that she, too, is interested in art. Meanwhile, Julie dumps Brady for Rod, who is offered a contract to the record label owned by his idol, Mick Silver , saying he liked Rod\'s demo tape, which Kevin sent in. Brady is given an advice column in the Living section of the Chicago Times.'] ["{{Plot}} The story starts out with the regular lives of three friends - Dave ([[Barry Watson , Adam , and Doofer  - who are head Social Committee in a frat house called KOK .

Rufus  is tasked by the leaders to travel back to San Dimas, California of 1988 using a time machine shaped like a phone booth to ensure that the Bill and Ted, then dim-witted high school students, successfully pass a history class. Should they fail, Ted\'s father, police captain Logan , plans to ship Ted to a military academy in Alaska, ending Bill & Ted\'s fledgling band, the "Wyld Stallyns", and altering the future. Rufus finds the two teenagers struggling to finish their history paper, which tasks them to describe how three historical figures would view San Dimas of the present, trying to obtain help from customers at a local Circle K convenience store. Rufus initially has difficulty convincing the two of his help when a copy of the phone booth time machine arrives, and versions of Bill and Ted from some hours in the future step out. They are able to convince their earlier selves that Rufus can be trusted by correctly guessing the number the two were thinking of, sixty-nine.

After a brief stop in prehistoric times to repair the booth, Bill and Ted program the machine to return to the present, but end up outside the Circle K on the night before, where Rufus was introducing himself to them.

Her life changes dramatically when her father loses his job, and the family must relocate to the fictional city, Crenshaw Heights, which Britney being the "White Girl" takes quite a while to adjust to. She meets Camille, head cheerleader of the Crenshaw Heights \'Warriors\' and her friends and fellow cheerleaders, Kirresha and Leti. She also meets Jesse, a male cheerleader, the only person who is nice to her on her first day. Britney, at the urging of Winnie, has already vowed to never cheer for another team , but after being dared by Camille and Jesse to show up at cheerleading tryouts, Britney impresses everyone with her cheer experience and skills and Camille, after being persuaded by her friends to "do it for the squad", reluctantly invites her into the squad. Britney and Jesse become close and eventually kiss. While in the gym, Tyson gropes Britney, and she grabs his testicles and squeezes them. She tells him she will "pluck his grapes or in your case, raisins" if he does it again. Around this time, singer Rihanna announces a TV special where all high school cheerleading squads can compete, with the winners appearing in a music video with her and winning new computers for their school. Winnie finds out that Britney is cheering with the Warriors and reveals this to her friends. A week later, Britney lies to Camille, telling her that she cannot cheer at the next game as she is holding a memorial service for her dead dog; she is actually Brad\'s date for Pacific Vista\'s Homecoming dance. Camille and Jesse arrive at Britney\'s to offer their condolences and when they see Britney and Brad dressed up, Camille kicks her off the squad. At the dance, Winnie reveals to everyone that she has been sleeping with Brad behind Britney\'s back and Britney dumps Brad on the spot, telling Winnie that she is "too much of a backstabber to have any real friends". The next day, the day of the auditions, Britney arrives at the Warrior\'s bus and comes to wish them good luck. When Winnie, with the rest of her team, makes fun of the Warriors, Britney stands up to Winnie and defends them. Camille, impressed by this, lets Britney cheer with them again. Jesse, however, is still mad at her for not admitting that she had a boyfriend, not even when they kissed. Both of the rivaling teams show their performances. At the auditions, the two finalists are Pacific Vista and Crenshaw Heights. PV wows the audience with their routine and Camille begins to get worried. Then Britney points out that all their steps are repetitive and that they have their secret weapon: krumping. CH, now dressed in cargos, steps on stage during PV\'s performance and begins mirroring their steps. Finally, they begin krumping, wiping PV off the stage and impressing Rihanna with their own demonstration. After CH\'s performance ends, Winnie approaches Rihanna and insists that the Crenshaw Heights squad should be disqualified  for interrupting PV\'s routine. This leads to an argument between Winnie and the rest of the Pacific Vista squad, during which Britney notes that the squad can choose to replace Winnie as Captain of the PV squad effective immediately; everyone present  votes in favor of replacing Winnie as Captain. Winnie protests, dismissing CH\'s style as "ghetto", and Rihanna responds that she will judge the squad by what they bring to the table and not by where they come from. Rihanna ultimately selects Crenshaw Heights as the winners, and the Pacific Vista squad  come forward to congratulate them. At the credits, CH team performs in Rihanna\'s video. Britney and Jesse make up, kissing backstage after their first performance. The movie ends with a made-for-movie music video of Rihanna\'s Pon De Replay with the Crenshaw Heights squad dancing in the background.'] ['The film opens with Michelle Mancini  driving at night during a storm. She realises that her fuel is low and pulls by a gas station. She is startled by the gas attendant who begins to refill her tank. Michelle hands her card to the attendant, however he returns and convinces Michelle that her credit card is not working and wants her to come into his office to speak to the credit card company on the phone. However, when Michelle gets inside the station and picks up the phone, there is no one on the other line. Convinced the attendant means her harm, Michelle sprays mace in his face and, as the door is locked, she smashes the window with the telephone and speeds away. The attendant shouts after her "Someone\'s in the back seat!" On the road, Michelle relaxes a little bit until someone sits up in the back seat and swings an axe at her. Inside a coffee shop lounge at Pendleton University, college student Parker Riley  is telling an urban legend called the \'Stanley Hall Massacre\' about 25 years ago when a crazy professor killed a dozen students at a closed down dorm on campus. Two of the students, Natalie Simon  and Brenda , listen with skepticism while they listen to Parker\'s girlfriend, Sasha Thomas , who operates a local radio call-in show, finish her broadcast. Paul Gardener , a pompous college reporter, joins the group and sneers at Parker\'s yarn. Brenda is obviously attracted to Paul. Natalie and Brenda walk towards the closed down Stanley Hall dorm building, where they suggest they chant Bloody Mary as a gag, when they are surprised by Damon Brooks , a misfit student who taunts them over going inside the boarded up building. Natalie and Brenda split up where Natalie goes home to her dorm room where she interrupts her Goth roommate, Tosh Guaneri , having sex with a guy. During a class, Professor William Wexler  is discussing folklore and urban legends. Wexler sees Brenda and Natalie laughing and confronts Brenda, telling if she doesn\'t believe in urban legends then she should come up to the front of the class and drink soda and pop rocks candy. She walks to the front but is hesitant on mixing the soda and the pop rocks. Damon walks up to the front of the class and tries drinking soda and pop rocks candy to prove the urban legend that his stomach will not explode. He then fakes going into a seizure and playing dead, much to the annoyance of Wexler and the amusement of his friends. Later that day, Natalie and Brenda see Paul distributing newspapers detailing the decapitation murder the previous night. The stuffy Dean Adams  and the campus security guard, Reese Wilson , seize copies of the school paper about the recent murder. Paul protests to the dean about a possible murder on the campus. But Adams tells Paul that there is no killer and the only crazy person is him. Natalie is shaken by Michelle\'s death, Damon Brooks  offers to talk and the two drive into the woods for privacy. Natalie soon realises that the only reason Damon brought her out into the woods was to have sex with her, and she rejects him. Before they leave Damon leaves the vehicle to urinate. Damon is attacked by the killer when he enters the woods, who hangs him from a tree with the rope attached to the car. When Natalie exits the car to search for Damon the killer approaches her, leading to her getting back in the car and driving away, strangling Damon in the process. Natalie goes to the campus security office and tells Reese about the killing, but when both arrive at the scene, the body and Damon\'s car are gone. The next day, after failing to locate Damon, Natalie\'s friends are skeptical of her claims of a murder and think that Damon\'s disappearance is one of his practical jokes. Natalie goes to the library to research urban legends by reading a book titled \'The Encyclopedia of Urban Legends\' and sees that Damon took it out last. While she is away, her roommate Tosh Guaneri is chatting to an anonymous guy online, organising a place to meet up for sex. She leaves the room to prepare but unknowingly leaves the door open. When she returns she finds that her anonymous guy has written that he is in her room. The killer attacks Tosh and begins to strangle her in the dark. Natalie walks in but thinks she is having sex again as she dismisses turning on the light and goes to bed with her head phones as Tosh dies. The next morning, Natalie wakes up and sees her roommate dead from slashed wrists and a message left by the killer written on a wall in blood saying: "Aren\'t you glad you didn\'t turn on the lights?" Everyone thinks that Tosh committed suicide and the message on the wall was "a very morbid suicide note". Natalie convinces Paul that Tosh\'s death was not a suicide and they look for evidence about the Stanley Hall Massacre, but they find no evidence and all the old newspaper clippings in the library from 1972 when the killings took place are gone. Natalie and Paul run into the creepy-looking janitor. They ask him questions about the Stanley Hall Massacre and the janitor tells them to \'talk to Wexler\'. Natalie and Paul sneak into Wexler\'s office for evidence and are caught by the professor. Brought before Dean Adams, Paul asks about the Stanley Hall Massacre, but the dean avoids the question by telling Paul that he\'s fired from the school newspaper and tells both of them to stop investigating something that never happened. Adams further tells Natalie that she has a criminal record for "reckless endangerment" and served a year of probation, and that she too is to stop investigating the urban legend about the Stanley Hall Massacre if she wants to stay at the college. Outside, Paul becomes angry when Natalie continues to avoid his questions about her past or if she knew Michelle. Later, Natalie walks into the campus swimming pool where Brenda is doing laps when she thinks she sees the killer approach, but the figure in the winter coat is only a fellow student. In the locker room, Natalie confides in Brenda that she did know Michelle. She tells the story of how she and Michelle were out driving one night on a dark road without their car\'s headlights on when a passing car flashed them and, with Michelle driving, the chased down the car in which the car went off the road and the driver was killed. That evening, Dean Adams is in the parking garage to drive home when the killer ambushes him and kills him by slashing his ankles and driving over him with his own car. At a fraternity party Parker is throwing, Paul arrives with an old newspaper article given to him by the janitor, which tells that Wexler was the sole survivor of the 1972 Stanley Hall Massacre and that he may be responsible for the killings. When Natalie admits to having feelings for Paul, they kiss. Brenda sees this and in a jealous rage, leaves the party. A little later, during the party, Parker gets a phone call and is told about what happened to his pet dog . He runs into a nearby bathroom to throw up when the killer attacks him and kills him by pouring pop rocks and liquid drain drown his throat. While Natalie is trying to reach Paul who ran off, Sasha is attacked at the radio station by the killer, who chases her through the building with an axe. Natalie hears Sasha screaming over the radio and runs over to the station but is too late, as the killer catches up to Sasha and axes her to death. Meanwhile, Reese searches Wexler\'s office but finds the floor covered with blood. She calls the police, but because of a serious thunderstorm, the roads are washed out. Reese goes off to find the killer on her own. Natalie runs into Paul outside her doom room and becomes suspicious of where he went during the time Sasha was killed. They both find Brenda, and they become suspicious about her. They drive away from the campus to look for help and stop at another gas station. While Paul goes to a phone to call the police, Brenda and Natalie notice a strange odor and upon opening the car trunk, discover the dead and mangled body of Professor Wexler. They both run away and into the nearby woods where they split up. On a back road, Natalie is picked up by the eerie janitor . But the killer chases them in another car and the janitor\'s truck runs off the road and the janitor hits his head and is killed. Natalie returns to the campus and tries calling for help on a police phone, but she hears screams from inside the abandoned Stanley Hall building, where there is a light on the third floor. Natalie breaks in to look around and finds the dead bodies of Parker, Adams, and Damon. She finds Brenda lying motionless on a bed in a room lit with hundreds of different candles. But before she can react, Natalie is knocked out. Waking up later, Natalie finds herself tied to the bed with the killer standing over her—the hood comes off to reveal..... Brenda. No longer acting like the casually nice and friendly girl as seen thorough the movie, the sneering and wild-eyed Brenda explains to Natalie that the boy who was killed in the accident by Michelle and Natalie years before was Brenda\'s boyfriend. Brenda befriended Natalie this whole time to torment her with urban legends as her insane way of getting even. Just as Brenda is about to kill Natalie by removing her kidneys as in the "kidney heist" urban legend, Reese appears to come to Natalie\'s rescue, but Brenda attacks Reese with a knife and wrestles her gun away. Just then, Paul appears, applauding Brenda for her revenge plan and saying he will to help cover up Brenda\'s guilt in return for the opportunity to help his career by writing a false story of how Wexler committed the murders. But Brenda is not fooled and before she can shoot either one of them, Reese revives and shoots Brenda, leaving Natalie to finish off her best friend as Brenda kept saying in a sad voice,"What kind of friend are you". After Brenda kept tempting Natalie to shoot her, Natalie decided to do so. Paul, who takes the gun away and also the 2 of them ran close to Reese and also she told them that she couldn\'t wait to be a cop before a bullet could hit her. Then Paul told Reese to stay here while they go and get help. However, as Paul and Natalie are driving away to find help and safety, Brenda sits up in the back seat of their car and attacks them in the same manner she killed Michelle in the opening scene. Paul smashes the car into a guardrail and Brenda smashes through the windshield and off a bridge into a river far below. Some time later at another college campus, a group of college students are discussing the recent Pendleton Massacre and urban legends when one student, who is the alive and well Brenda with a different haircut, offers to tell them the real story about it all.'] ['{{Plot}} Timothy "Dildo/Dunph" Dunphy , is a high school senior living in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, in 1974. He hangs out with a group of friends, mainly to smoke marijuana at the water tower overlooking town. His friend, Drugs Delaney , suggests going out to a local bar called "The Edge,", which a sexually promiscuous classmate known as Bunny Cote is known to frequent. Accepting the idea, Dunph and his friends head back to his house to pick up his bong. Dunph tries to get his wheelchair-using younger brother, Jackie , to smuggle it out of the house, but they are slowed down by Dunph\'s father Pat , who insists that they all come inside and greet his poker-playing friends. While they are exchanging pleasantries, Jackie shows up with the bong wrapped in Dunph\'s jacket. The bong falls on the floor, and Pat picks it up asking what it is. Jackie tries to fool him by saying it is a horn..."a music horn". Pat\'s friend, Joey , asks Dunph to demonstrate his playing abilities. Dunph tries, but blows air, and Pat, having heard enough, lets them leave. Pat\'s friends all know what the device is, but choose not to inform on Dunph and his friends. After "The Edge", Dunph and his friends get into a car  and drive off, with a big cloud of marijuana smoke fogging up the passenger compartment. Unable to see where he is going, Dunph rear-ends the back of a marked police car, with its occupant inside. Kaveech, one of Pat\'s poker-playing friends, has influence with a local judge, and manages to negotiate a plea to keep Dunph out of reform school. He is shipped off to Cornwall Academy, a Connecticut boys\' boarding school with a segregated all-girls school nearby under the same name. As a condition of parole, Dunph must finish his senior year and graduate from Cornwall, or spend a year in jail. Though Dunph makes a sincere effort to stay out of trouble, it quickly catches up with him. The first incident is when Jack Wheeler , a preppy blonde student who comes from an obviously privileged life, introduces Dunph to Billy Fu, a middle eastern exchange student with "the best reefer on campus". The trio fashions a bong out of a 55-gallon drum hidden in a large bush, and smokes about half a bag of marijuana. Dunph later learns that Billy Fu routinely misses classes and gets away with it, because his father promises to donate a large amount of money to the school, on condition that Billy graduates. It does not take long for Dunphy to incur the wrath of Mr Funderburk , his rigid dorm master, and Dean Bill Mort, who receives a letter simply addressed to the school, but meant for Dunph\'s eyes. The letter is from Drugs Delaney, revealing Dunph\'s hatred of the school and of Funderburk, who routinely assigns "work hours" to students who misbehave. Eventually, Dunph accumulates more work hours than he has class days. Dunph also manages to make friends with Jane Weston , whom Wheeler calls "hands down, the coolest girl in school". The pair eventually develop their relationship from friendship to romance, but the relationship is brought to a screeching halt one day. This is the second part of an earlier incident when Dunph\'s room, shared by a boy named Irving , is raided by Funderburk. Wheeler\'s room is also raided. The incident bringing Dunph\'s and Jane\'s relationship to a stop occurs when Dunph, Jane, Billy Fu, Jizz and Wheeler are in Dunph\'s room smoking marijuana with a bottle of alcohol present. Wheeler excuses himself to make a phone call. Moments later, Funderburk bursts into the room, catching everyone in the act of getting high and drunk. Funderburk orders Jane out of the room just as Wheeler shows up, innocently saying he was checking to see if anyone was studying. Funderburk orders him out as well. In the midst of a morality lecture on how he intends to turn everyone in as an incentive for them not to repeat such an incident in the future, Dunph stops Funderburk in mid-sentence, telling him to "shut the fuck up". Funderburk calls Dunph outside. Dunph reveals his knowledge of the deal with Billy Fu\'s father, and if Funderburk reports everyone but Billy, Dunph will in turn, report Billy. Funderburk counters by producing the marijuana he confiscated in the earlier raid. Dunph offers Funderburk a deal, he will let himself be expelled if everyone else gets work hours. Funderburk accepts. When the boys are called to the Dean\'s office, they are surprised to learn that the only punishment was probation and work hours. Dunph eventually puts everything together and learns why: Funderburk gave him an even worse deal than they had worked out by having had Jane expelled from the school. Funderburk\'s actions also reversed her acceptance to Brown University the following year. Not long after, Dunph learns that Wheeler is accepted into Yale University by a letter of recommendation from Funderburk. Knowing that Wheeler was caught with marijuana during the first raid, Dunph concludes that Wheeler made his own deal with Funderburk to inform on everyone and have Jane expelled. Wheeler denies it, and Dunph threatens to throw Wheeler off the roof, where they are smoking marijuana one evening and Dunph reveals his knowledge of the situation. "Your life\'s gonna suck anyway," Dunph says to a visibly defeated and weak Wheeler. Dunph later makes his way into the Dean\'s office at Brown University, where he tells the Dean that he was the one responsible for Jane\'s expulsion from Cornwall, and that she was innocent of any wrongdoing. He convinces the Dean of Jane\'s innocence, which the Dean uses to influence the review board to overturn their decision to revoke Jane\'s admission. The movie ends with Dunph graduating and even publicly defying Funderburk by refusing to shake his hand as customary at graduation, with his father and Jackie coming to school to pick him up. Dunph is given an acceptance letter from Rhode Island Junior College by his father. Dunph also reveals his intention to transfer to a "senior college...where people sleep over and shit."'] ["Five women, Linda , Jessica , Kimberly , Suzanne  and Janey  buy the old Hokstedter place for their new sorority house.

The kids all see Ray and begin to run and Ricky is caught by Ray when his leg is pinned to the stairs by a crowbar. His arm is then ripped off, causing him to bleed to death. As the others panic inside, they look and it seems as if Ray is gone. Sean leaves the house to confront Ray, while Eden grabs a rifle from the bedroom. Ray slashes Sean's face with his crowbar and then impales him through the chest. Eden and Eric drag Sean inside and try in vain to stop the bleeding, but he dies on the floor. Rachel cries over the loss of her boyfriend, while Eden talks CeCe into turning Sean's body into a human voodoo doll to control Ray. Meanwhile, Ray hooks the towing hook to the foundation of the house and pulls the front porch off, dragging Eden with it. Eden gets back to CeCe who finishes the spell, despite her leg being crushed by a support beam. Ray begins to climb the wreckage toward CeCe, but CeCe stabs Sean's body several times to slow Ray down in his advance. Ray finally reaches her and slashes CeCe's throat, while Eden, Eric and Rachel escape. As the remaining three try to escape, Ray follows in his truck and pulls beside them. He tosses a chain around Rachel's neck and drags her half way out of the car, but Eden grabs hold of her legs. As both cars are accelerating, Rachel screams and is impaled on a dead log. Eric and Eden then try to pass through the swamp to escape Ray, who dives beneath the murky water. As Eric and Eden headed for dry land, Ray attacks, missing them both, but separating them. Eden ends up in the graveyard, and Eric deeper in the swamp. Eden makes her way into a crypt where she finds an altar and an open casket where all the victims are kept. Eden tries to leave but Ray comes and locks her in. In panic, Eden hides beneath Tammy's body. Eric is then thrown into the crypt by Ray, who then goes to the altar. Eden starts to cry until Eric opens his eyes. Eden can't hide her gasp, unknowingly drawing Ray's attention. As Ray looks in to inspect the bodies, he grabs Eden's foot, but Eric began to breathe to protect Eden. Ray then stabs Eric in the head with a screwdriver. Eden then fights Ray by setting him on fire and pushing him down a chute, but he drags her with him. She then uses a charm she got from CeCe that protects against evil. Ray submits, but the snakes possessing his body emerge to try to take the charm from her. Eden escapes up the chute, using the charm as a diversion. Eden then traps Ray and the snakes in the chute. As she tries to drive off in his tow truck, she hears an inhuman shriek, signaling Ray is back. Ray chases Eden out of the truck before she can do anything and she runs to hide in the bayou. She hides behind a bush close to Ray. He hears a rustling and hacks the bush, revealing she's not there. Just then the tow truck emerges through the underbrush and crushes Ray in half against a tree, killing him. Eden then staggers off into the trees, and the two snakes can be seen crawling out of Ray's decomposing torso to find another host."] ['A group of teenage friends travel to Camp Placid Pines to be camp counselors for the summer, Julie , Dean , Whitney , Jason  and Tobe .

Kathryn\'s real intention, however, is to use Cecile to indirectly take revenge on Court Reynolds, her ex-lover, who had dumped her for Cecile. Kathryn asks her step-brother, Sebastian Valmont  to seduce Cecile; he refuses as he is planning to seduce virgin Annette Hargrove  - a \'paradigm of chastity and virtue\' and spoil her social reputation.

Their apartment\'s handyman is an eccentric but kindly and humble Okinawan immigrant named Mr. Miyagi . Daniel befriends Ali Mills , an attractive high school cheerleader, at the same time angering her arrogant ex-boyfriend, Johnny Lawrence . Johnny is the best student at the Cobra Kai dojo, where he is taught an unethical, vicious form of martial arts. Daniel knows a little karate from books and a few classes at the YMCA, but Johnny easily defeats him in their first encounter. Thereafter, Johnny and his gang of Cobra Kai students torment Daniel at every opportunity. When Miyagi witnesses the gang giving Daniel a savage beating, he intervenes and single-handedly defeats all five boys with ease. Awed, Daniel asks Miyagi to be his teacher. Miyagi refuses, but agrees to go with Daniel to the Cobra Kai dojo in order to resolve the conflict. They confront the sensei, John Kreese , an ex-Special Forces Vietnam Veteran who sneers at the concepts of mercy and restraint. Kreese and Miyagi agree to a match between Johnny and Daniel in two months\' time at the "All Valley Karate Tournament," where the Cobra Kai students can fight Daniel on equal terms. Miyagi also requests that the bullying stop while Daniel trains. Kreese orders his students to leave Daniel alone, but under the condition that if Daniel does not show up for the tournament, the harassment will resume and Miyagi himself will also become a target. Miyagi becomes Daniel\'s teacher and, slowly, a surrogate father figure. He begins Daniel\'s training by having him perform laborious chores such as waxing cars, sanding a wooden floor, refinishing a fence, and painting Miyagi\'s house. Each chore is accompanied with a specific movement, such as clockwise/counter-clockwise hand motions. Daniel fails to see any connection to his training from these hard chores and eventually feels frustrated, believing he has learned nothing of karate. When he expresses his frustration, Miyagi reveals that Daniel has been learning defensive blocks through muscle memory learned by performing the chores. As Daniel\'s training continues more overtly, his bond with Miyagi becomes closer. He learns that Miyagi lost his wife and son in childbirth at Manzanar internment camp while he was serving overseas with the United States Army during World War II. The loss of his family and Daniel\'s loss of his father further strengthens the father-son surrogacy. Daniel also discovers that the outwardly peaceful and serene Miyagi was a recipient of the Medal of Honor for valor against German forces in Europe. Through the teaching, Daniel learns not only karate but also important life lessons such as the importance of balance, reflected by the belief that martial arts training is as much about training the spirit as the body. Daniel applies the life lessons that Miyagi has taught him to strengthen his relationship with Ali. At the tournament, Daniel surprises everyone by reaching the semi-finals. Johnny advances to the finals, scoring three unanswered points against a highly skilled opponent. Kreese instructs Bobby Brown, one of his more compassionate students and the least vicious of Daniel\'s tormentors, to disable Daniel with an illegal attack to the knee. Bobby reluctantly does so, severely injuring Daniel and getting disqualified in the process. As Daniel writhes in pain on the ground, Bobby profusely apologizes before he is pulled away. Daniel is taken to the locker room and checked out, with the physician determining that he cannot continue. Although Miyagi assures him he has already proven himself, Daniel believes that if he does not continue, his tormentors will have gotten the best of him. He persuades Miyagi to use a pain suppression technique to allow him to finish the tournament. As Johnny is about to be declared the winner by default, Daniel hobbles into the ring. The Championship match is a seesaw battle, as neither Johnny nor Daniel is able to break through either\'s defenses. At one point Daniel succeeds in a scissor leg technique tripping Johnny and delivers a blow to the back of the head, giving Johnny a nose bleed. The match is paused for Johnny to be looked at by Kreese. Kreese directs Johnny to sweep Daniel\'s injured leg, an unethical move. Johnny looks horrified at the order but reluctantly agrees after Kreese\'s intimidation. Despite the moves, Daniel gets up each time. At last, Daniel and Johnny are tied, with the next point deciding victory. Daniel, barely able to stand, assumes the "Crane" stance, a technique he observed Miyagi performing on the beach during his training. The referee signals to begin, and Johnny lunges in. Daniel jumps and delivers a front kick to Johnny\'s chin, winning the tournament. Johnny, having gained newfound respect for his adversary, takes Daniel\'s trophy from the Master of Ceremonies and presents it to Daniel himself, sincerely proclaiming "You\'re all right, LaRusso! Good match!" Miyagi looks on proudly as Daniel celebrates his victory.'] ['The storyline is told through a series of flashbacks.

Justin saves the two for a chance to be praised at using magic to save Alex once again after Alex does something wrong. Once in the Caribbean, the family meets a boy working at the hotel that Alex instantly develops a crush on. The family then visits a street fair, where they meet a street magician and former wizard   named Archie who wants to turn his girlfriend, Giselle, from a parrot back into a human by finding the Stone of Dreams, which has the power to grant any wish or reverse any spell. Jerry considers it crazy since many wizards have gone on the quest and never returned. Later, after Alex was about to use a spell on her mother to convince her to let Alex hang out with the boy from the hotel, she gets caught, grounded and forbidden to use magic for two months. After a heated argument with Theresa, Alex, in a fit of rage, wishes that her parents had never met. The smuggled full-wizard wand and spell book, which Alex was holding at the time, grants her wish. As a result, Jerry and Theresa do not remember Justin, Alex, Max, and they don\'t know each other. Alex, Max and Justin attempt to get a spell-book from Jerry by levitating it out of his pocket, but he catches it.

Eventually, Alex and Justin succeed in finding the Stone of Dreams, but Giselle steals the stone. The kids tell Theresa and Jerry their story. Theresa doesn\'t believe them because she thinks she would never forget her own children. While trying to figure out how to reverse the spell without the stone of dreams, Jerry mentions that if one of the kids was a full wizard, they might be able to cast a spell to reverse it. While preparing to begin the full-wizard contest, Max finally loses all memory of who he is and gets sucked into the vortex of non-existence. Theresa remembers him slightly, and realizes that they were telling the truth.

However, Justin has lost all his memory . Alex tells him that even though they pick on each other, she looks up to him and begs Justin not leave her here alone. Justin tells her that he\'d never leave her and that even though he doesn\'t know her, he believes her, and wants to help, but he cannot and is sucked into the same vortex that Max was. Meanwhile Theresa is back at the resort and sees that Giselle has returned to human form with the Stone of Dreams hanging by her neck. She wanted to leave Archie now that she was in human form.

Soon after, they return to Forks and Bella forgives Edward for leaving her. The Cullens vote in favor of Bella being transformed into a vampire, much to Edward and Rosalie's dismay.

Jake was a star athlete on the football team at home, but in this new city, he is an outsider with a reputation for being a quick tempered brawler after a video of him on the Internet starting a fight in a football game, because one of his opponents made a rash comment about Jake\'s dead father, circulates around his new school. Making an attempt to fit in, at the invitation of a flirtatious classmate, Baja Miller , Jake goes to a party where he is unwillingly pulled into a fight with the fighting champion at the school, Ryan McCarthy . Originally, Jake does not wish to fight until Ryan taunts him about his father who died while driving drunk with Jake in the car. Unsurprisingly, Jake is defeated in the fight, but a classmate, Max Cooperman , who later becomes one of his best friends introduces himself to Jake and tells him about the sport known as Mixed Martial Arts. He sees a star in Jake and asks that he meet with his mentor, Jean Roqua . It is immediately apparent to Jake that MMA is not street fighting, but rather an art form he wants to master. Roqua agrees to take Jake as a pupil, but under the condition of Jake being unable to fight outside of the gym which Jake agrees to, though knowing he wishes to confront Ryan anyway. Baja attempts to apologize to Jake, but he does not sympathize with her and refuses to forgive her. Baja then confronts Ryan about the fight with Jake and then proceeds to end their relationship.

After Ryan insults him again and leaves, Jake attends training with Roqua while still angry about the incident; Roqua asks Jake to leave to "cool off". After he and Max leave the gym Jake gets into a brawl with a group of guys in a Hummer whom Jake easily disposes of while Max films. This video again circulates around the school raising Jake\'s social status but in the process only annoying Ryan. Ryan then proceeds to challenge Jake to compete in the Beatdown, an underground fighting tournament of which Ryan is the reigning champion. After having been banished from the gym by Roqua after his fight is discovered, Jake begs for forgiveness saying his anger is quelled when he is training with Roqua. Roqua agrees to allow Jake to train at his gym again, but does not take it easy on him anymore. He then prepares to compete in the Beatdown. Jake apologizes to Baja for not listening when she first apologized and the two proceed to begin a relationship. While training with Roqua, Jake inquires why he lives in the gym. Jake discovers that Roqua is from Brazil and he is in exile because he believes he is the reason his brother, Joseph the favorite son, was killed and his father had disowned him for this. After being informed that Jake has decided not to compete in the Beatdown, Ryan invites Max to hang out at his house; there he begins to spar with Max before brutally assaulting him and leaving him at Jake\'s door. Jake and Baja take Max to the hospital where Jake decides to fight and when Baja begs him not to, he states that doing nothing has consequences. Before he goes to the tournament, he has a brief argument with Roqua about his decision to fight. Roqua eventually assents and tells him to "control the outcome" of the fight. Jake arrives at the tournament where it is about to begin. After a mix-up where Jake and Ryan almost fight in the first round, they both proceed to make their way through each leg.

He rigs the auditions for the school prom, and they enact his plan, winning the audition in the absence of Vadar. Thinking they're on drugs, Vadar institutes drug tests which provides no solution to dealing with the Eradicators. However, they are set up by Vadar, Whitney and Marget and made unable to participate through vandalism of school property .

Driving her car through the school grounds, she has no regard for the safety of anyone on the school grounds. During the aftermath, she tries to kill The Eradicators, as well as Eaglebauer, and even substitute teacher Rita. Not so easily defeated, however, the Eradicators continue to fight back even against the vehicular attempt at manslaughter, and slick a section of the school with chemical extinguishers, which cause Vadar to crash into the school, causing it to explode, and the school catches fire for the second time in 12 years.

Mark is a loner, an outsider, whose only outlet for his teenage angst and aggression is his unauthorized radio station. His pirate station\'s theme song is "Everybody Knows" by Leonard Cohen and there are glimpses of cassettes by such alternative musicians as The Jesus and Mary Chain, Camper Van Beethoven, Primal Scream, Soundgarden, Ice-T, Bad Brains, Concrete Blonde, Henry Rollins, and The Pixies. By day, Mark is seen as a loner, hardly talking to anyone around him; by night, he expresses his outsider views about what is wrong with American society. When he speaks his mind about what is going on at his school and in the community, more and more of his fellow students tune in to hear his show. Nobody knows the true identity of "Hard Harry" or "Happy Harry Hard-on," as Mark refers to himself, until Nora Diniro , a fellow student, tracks him down and confronts him the day after a student named Malcolm commits suicide after Harry attempts to reason with him. The radio show becomes increasingly popular and influential after Harry confronts the suicide head-on, exhorting his listeners to do something about their problems instead of surrendering to them through suicide—at the crescendo of his yelled speech, an overachieving student named Paige Woodward  jams her various medals and accolades into a microwave and turns it on. She then sits, watching the awards cook until the microwave explodes, injuring her. While this is happening, other students act out in cathartic release. Eventually, the radio show causes so much trouble in the community that the FCC is called in to investigate. During the fracas, it is revealed that the school\'s principal  has been expelling "problem students," namely, students with below-average SAT scores, such as an unwed mother, in an effort to boost the district\'s test scores while still keeping their names on the rolls  in order to keep the government money. Realizing he has started something huge, Mark decides it is up to him to end it. He dismantles his radio station and attaches it to his mother\'s old jeep, creating a mobile transmitter so his position can\'t be triangulated. Pursued by the police and the FCC, Nora drives the jeep around while Mark broadcasts. The harmonizer he uses to disguise his voice breaks, and with no time left to fix it, Mark decides to broadcast his final message as himself. They finally drive up to the crowd of protesting students, and Mark tells them that the world belongs to them and that they should make their own future. The police step in and arrest Mark and Nora. As they are taken away, Mark reminds the students to "talk hard." As the film ends, the voices of other students  speak as intros for their own independent stations, which can be heard broadcasting across the country.'] ['Sean , Ritch , Wes , and Lauren  celebrate their college graduation by breaking into Saranoc Grotto, a forest heavily marked with "No Trespassing" signs and surrounded by a tall fence.

The recently divorced teacher, super-passive Larry Pearl, is on thin ice with the football fanatic principal, Principal Paulson, who is being pressured by the district superintendent to raise driver’s education completion rates or lose his coveted football program. With this in mind, Principal Paulson and his assistant, with a secret desire for his job, Abner Frasier, hire an outside driver’s education instructor with a very tough reputation, Edna Savage, aka E.W. Savage, who quickly takes control of the class. The plot focuses mostly on the students and their interactions with their teachers and each other. In the beginning, Rico is the loner with just a few friends, Chadley is the bookish nerd with few friends who longs to be cool and also longs to be a part of Vanessa’s life who is the young, friendly and attractive girl who had to fake her mother’s signature on her driver’s education permission slip. Kichi is the hip-hop Asian kid who often raps what he has to say and constantly flirts with Maria, the rich foreign girl who thinks that the right-of-way on the roadways always goes to  “my father’s limo”. Finally you have stereotypical football meathead J.J., who needs to pass his English exam to keep his eligibility and constantly asks out and gets rejected by Alice, the tomboy whose father owns “Santini & Son” Concrete Company. Alice is portrayed as being the “son” her father wanted. As the movie progresses, the students’ relationships with their teacher, each other and their driving abilities all begin to improve. Friendships are formed in and out of the classroom. All the while Abner, Acting Principal while Paulson is out of town, is spying on the entire bunch, teachers and students, and constantly calling the superintendent with the purpose of smearing the reputation of Principal Paulson in hopes of taking his job. In the meantime, Edna, who was initially cool and somewhat hostile to Larry, begins to see him in a new light. At the same time, Larry, who was initially a nervous and passive man due mainly to stress involving his ex-wife and their divorce proceedings, becomes more assertive and confident in himself, which Edna finds very attractive. Just as things start to look up for the class in school and at home, an untimely accident involving Chad, Vanessa and the driver’s education car brings the entire class closer together. Literally, each character, save for Abner whose attempts to take over as principal are thwarted by the progression of all the characters and the timely return of Principal Paulson, reaches a point in their life where they seem happy with themselves, their relationships with their friends and their relationships with their parents. Ultimately, all the kids pass the course with flying colors, and Larry and Edna end up falling in love and entering into a romantic relationship.'] ['A group of Florida high school students plan on losing their virginity. They go to Porky\'s nightclub believing that they can hire a prostitute to satisfy their sexual desires. Porky takes their money but humiliates the kids by dumping them in the swamp. When the group demand their money back, the sheriff, who turns out to be Porky\'s brother, arrives to drive them away, but not before his minions extort the rest of their money and cause them more embarrassment. After Mickey  is beaten so badly he has to be hospitalized, the gang becomes hellbent on exacting revenge on Porky and his brother, eventually succeeding in sinking his establishment in the swamp. Porky and his men, joined by the sheriff, chase after the group, but they make it across the county line , where they are met by a group of the local police officers, one of whom is Mickey\'s older brother Ted, and the high school band. After Ted repeatedly damages Porky\'s car, he says that all charges against Porky for driving an unsafe vehicle will be dropped if the night\'s events are forgiven. Because the boys were too young to be legally allowed in Porky\'s in the first place, Porky and his brother have no choice but to agree.

While a few girls run out, most stay, finding the situation funny. To test their attitude, Tommy sticks his tongue out through his peephole, but gets it smeared with soap. Infuriated, he drops his pants and sticks his penis through the opening just before female coach Beulah Balbricker  walks into the shower area. Spotting the protruding member, she sneaks up on Tommy, grabs his protruding part and pulls with all her might. Tommy manages to pull free and escape, but Beulah is now determined to prove that the offending member  belongs to Tommy, going so far as to request that Principal Carter hold a police-type line-up of the boys in the nude so she can identify it. However, Carter balks at such a request, and while the other basketball coaches laugh almost uncontrollably, Coach Brackett suggests getting the police involved. When this gets even Carter laughing, Balbricker leaves in a huff. The film ends with Ms. Balbricker sneaking out of the bushes to ambush Tommy and actually dragging his pants down, but she is pulled off of him by police and dragged away screaming that she saw "it" and that she can identify him.'] ["Clay Easton  is a college freshman who returns home to Los Angeles, California, for Christmas to find things very different from the way he left them.

Grace points the gun at him and tells him to stop the truck. The hitchhiker keeps hitting the gas, brutally hurting Jim. The police, who still think Grace and Jim are the killers, then show up and see Grace with the hitchhiker at gunpoint.

He also informs her that he will be taking her for psychiatric care and released to her parents. The hitchhiker is bound in handcuffs with a bulletproof vest and placed in the back of a police van, with Grace and Esteridge driving behind them in an SUV. During the ride, the hitchhiker is able to break free of his restraints, kills the guard who is watching him, and shoots the policeman in the passenger seat. The driver loses control and rolls the van, taking out an oncoming car, which crashes into Esteridge\'s SUV. Lieutenant Esteridge\'s leg has been trapped in the accident. Grace takes Esteridge\'s gun, leaving him unarmed and helpless, and slowly makes her way to the van in which Ryder is caught. Grace opens the back door, whereupon the hitchhiker takes her gun and locks her in the back. The hitchhiker sees a pool of gasoline near the van, and shoots it, igniting the van. Grace manages to get a shotgun from the front seat of the van right before the gasoline explodes. The hitchhiker shoots Esteridge in the head and walks away. However, Grace survives the explosion and shoots the hitchhiker several times, finally killing him and ending his rampage.'] ['The film continues the story of Sara (now being played by Izabella Miko.

Milly makes friends with her new neighbor Geneva, and Milly and her eight-year-old brother Louis  have difficulty adjusting to their new schools, while their mother Charlene  copes with a demotion at work and her inability to learn how to use a computer. Louis is also plagued by bullies down the street who won't let him get around the block. During the first night at the house, Charlene tells Milly she will need her help to make this work. Milly returns to her bedroom and is talking to her pet bird when something flies past the window, but when Milly goes to investigate she sees nothing. Milly and Geneva observe Eric Gibb , an autistic boy living next door with his alcoholic uncle Hugo . Eric has never spoken a word in his life, doesn't like to be around people and exhibits bizarre behavior related to flying, such as balancing on the roof of his house with his arms spread out like an airplane. Milly hears that Eric's parents died in a plane crash, and that somehow, in the instant of their death, he knew; and that he did the only thing he could think of to try to save them, which was to become an airplane. Later that night, Milly and her family watch as Eric  and three adults appear outside with Eric in a straight jacket and being restrained by two men, with Mrs. Sherman arguing with a woman there about what is best for Eric. Milly later reveals to Geneva one night when Milly's mother is out for the evening that she finds Eric attractive. Although Eric cannot communicate with anyone, he begins to react to Milly, first by mimicking her movements and facial expressions. Mrs. Sherman observes this interaction and asks Milly to keep an eye on Eric, explaining that because of Uncle Hugo's drinking, Eric is in constant danger of being taken by authorities and placed in a hospital; but that when Eric was taken away before, he became so sick that he almost died. Milly works with Eric over the course of the school year and takes notes on his progress, which is slow at first. Milly notes excitedly the first time Eric smiles on his own rather than merely copying her own smile. Eric does nothing when Milly throws balls to him, except for one day when he spontaneously reaches out and catches a stray baseball flying toward Milly's head. However, strange occurrences, like Eric's apparent ability to appear in his own window one instant and in Milly's the next without any link between their homes, begin to make Milly question reality. In her notes, Milly wonders whether Eric is becoming more like her, or the other way around. On a school field trip, with no one present except Eric, Milly falls off a bridge while trying to pick a rose. Knocked unconscious, she dreams that she wakes up in the hospital, with Eric sitting on the windowsill. After a conversation with him , she becomes convinced he can fly. Eric gives her the rose she was trying to reach and then, taking her hand, leads her out of the window and the two begin flying. The two watch a fireworks display from a cloud before they share a kiss and return to the hospital window. After watching Eric fly off, Milly's dream becomes a nightmare as she sees her Dad in a hospital bed, dead, with a girl called Mona  throwing a volleyball at her which knocks her out of the window. Milly then wakes up in a hospital and tells her mother that Eric can fly and that he caught her as she fell. A shrink, Dr. Grenader, talks to Milly and tells her that Eric caught her as she only has a concussion and no serious injuries. Dr Grenader, however, puts forth a more logical explanation and explains her belief that Eric can fly may be due to stress caused by the death of her father as he died from cancer. Upon returning home, Milly notices the rose on her windowsill and now becomes truly convinced that Eric can fly. When she shouts to Uncle Hugo about Eric's whereabouts, he replies by saying the institute has taken him away as Hugo was found drunk again. Despite the efforts of Milly and her family, they are not allowed to see Eric when they visit the institute. As they leave due to not been allowed in, Eric tries to force the window open and is restrained by two men who try to sedate him. Another attempt by Louis to get around the block fails as the bullies tear his tricycle apart and to make matters worse, his dog Max is hit by a passing car and is taken to an animal hospital. Later that evening, Milly thinks she spots Eric on his roof during a thunderstorm and after climbing into the attic, she finds Eric, who is shivering with cold and still wearing a strait-jacket after managing to somehow escape the institute. As Milly helps him, he pulls out a box and from within it, he takes out a ring which he gives to Milly. When the authorities arrive at Eric's house the next day, Milly sneaks Eric out and the police chase them to the roof of the school during a carnival. Eric turns to Milly and speaks her name, the first word he has spoken thus far. Milly asks Eric if he really can fly, and he smiles and nods his head. He holds her hand and the two fall off the building. Just before hitting the ground, Milly and Eric begin flying in plain view of the crowd around the carnival, which follows Milly and Eric down the streets of their town, shocking Charlene, Louis, Geneva, and Uncle Hugo. Eric brings Milly to her own window, tells her he loves her, and kisses her before he says goodbye and flies away. Milly is heartbroken, but quickly realizes why Eric had to leave: Over the following weeks, spectators, policemen, and scientists mob the town, looking for an explanation and taking all of Eric's belongings away to be analyzed. Milly speculates that Eric too would have been taken by scientists had he remained. It is revealed that Milly's father knew he had cancer, but kept it a secret from his family because he did not want them to worry. Rather than seek treatment, he said goodbye and committed suicide. His refusal to fight for his life left the Michaelsons feeling helpless and hopeless, but Eric's ability to fly shows them that anything is possible if you believe. Unlike Milly's father, Eric's uncle and the remaining Michaelsons refuse to give up: Eric's uncle beats his drinking problem and gets an excellent job; the Michaelson's dog Max gets better; Louis dominates the bullies down the street ; Charlene masters the computer at work; and Milly regains interest in her life and relationships with those around her. The movie ends with Milly looking out the window waiting for Eric. As the sun sets, she throws out a paper airplane which flies ever upward."] ["Ka Fu  and Natalie  , are from two different family backgrounds.

However, his clumsy, bumbling, hazardous nature prevents him from doing so. In one such instance shown at the film\'s beginning, while he picks up a banana peel on the ground and describing how hazardous is it, a kid trips over his backpack, causing his marbles to roll out and the kids to slip on them, one girl sending her lunchbox flying and it hits the principal on the head. As Scout swings his backpack to put the banana peel in the garbage, he knocks a kid off his bike, setting off a chain reaction that ends with a plastic squirrel the bike crashed into hitting a truck full of giant frozen tuna, which slide on the road and eat the last member of the safety patrol, "Joe Lobes" Lobenick, leaving him severely traumatized, and deleting the list of safety patrol until he recovers. The teachers try to convince Principal Tromp to put Scout on safety patrol, as he is the only one left on the list. Tromp agrees, but gets the school boundaries changed, transferring Scout to Laurelview Middle School. Laurelview is currently experiencing petty theft, on a grand scale.

When fellow patrolman Coop asks Scout to get his gloves, he discovers Mrs. Marlowe\'s office is on fire, so he puts the fire out and saves the hamster; however, when the key and the lighter fall out of his pocket, it appears as though Scout stole the key and started the fire, so he is kicked off of safety patrol and forbidden to attend the Fall Ball.

But when the blood turns out to be real and people start disappearing, everyone quickly realizes that the only way out of this killer game is to be the last one left alive."] ['Cher Horowitz  is a good-natured but superficial girl who is attractive, popular, and extremely wealthy. At a few months shy of sixteen, she has risen to the top of the high school social scene and is happy and self-assured in her insular, fashion-obsessed world. She lives in a Beverly Hills mansion with her father, Mel , a ferocious $500-an-hour litigator; her mother has long since died, having succumbed to complications while undergoing liposuction. Cher\'s best friend is Dionne Davenport , who is also rich, pretty, and hip, and understands what it\'s like to be envied. Among the few people to find much fault with Cher is Josh , her socially conscious ex-stepbrother who visits during a break from college. Josh and Cher spar continually but without malice; she refers to him as "granola breath" and mocks his scruffy idealism, while he teases her for being selfish, vain, and superficial, and says that her only direction in life is "toward the mall." Illustrating that Cher\'s selfishness is usually innocent and relatively harmless, Cher plays matchmaker for two lonely, nerdy, hard-grading teachers, Mr. Hall  and Miss Geist . She achieves her original purpose – to make them relax their grading standards so she can renegotiate a bad report card – but when she sees their newfound happiness, she realizes she likes doing good deeds. Cher now decides that the ultimate way she can give back to the community would be to "adopt" a "tragically unhip" new girl at school, Tai Frasier . Cher and Dionne give Tai a makeover and initiate her into the mysteries of popularity. Cher also tries to extinguish the strong mutual attraction between Tai and Travis , an amiable skateboarding slacker, and to steer her toward Elton , a rich snob. Her second matchmaking scheme backfires when Elton rejects Tai and makes a play for Cher. Matters worsen, however, when Cher\'s "project" works a bit too well and Tai\'s popularity begins to surpass Cher\'s, especially after Tai has a "near-death" adventure at the mall that helps to skyrocket her to fame at school. Other classmates, including Dionne and Cher\'s longtime rival, Amber , soon gravitate toward Tai, and Cher finds herself demoted from queen to courtier at high school. Meanwhile, Cher has a couple of romantic mishaps with boys at school. The first involves Elton; the next concerns Christian ([[Justin Walker , a handsome classmate with great fashion sense who turns out to be gay. Cher naively and repeatedly fails to recognize Christian\'s homosexual tendencies, and tries unsuccessfully to seduce him while they are alone one night watching Spartacus. The next day, Dionne\'s boyfriend, Murray , roars with laughter, which makes Cher\'s mistake clear to her at last. Events reach a crisis after Cher fails her driver\'s test and can\'t "renegotiate" the result. When Cher goes home, crushed, Tai confides that she\'s taken a fancy to Josh and wants Cher to help her "get" him. Cher says she doesn\'t think Josh is right for her, and they quarrel. Cher, left all alone, begins to think she has created a monster in her own image. Feeling "totally clueless", she reflects on her priorities and her repeated failures to understand or appreciate the people in her life. Most of all, she keeps thinking about Josh and Tai, and wonders why she cares so much. After much soul-searching , Cher discovers she has fallen in love with Josh. She begins making awkward but sincere efforts to live a more useful life, even captaining the school\'s Pismo Beach disaster relief effort. A scene near the end of the film finds Cher and Josh stumbling over how to admit their mutual feelings for each other, finally culminating in a tender kiss on the stairs of her home. The film has a happy Hollywood ending for Cher: Mr. Hall and Miss Geist get married; her friendships with Tai and Dionne are reaffirmed; Tai and Travis are in love; and, in Josh\'s arms, she too has now finally found love.'] ["{{plot}} A tourist, Vera Brandt , is chased and beheaded in the Swiss countryside.

Later on Tommy learns about the reasons why Romano and Lincoln continue the fight, the former to send his father\'s body to Cuba and to make money, the latter to support his girlfriend and their baby daughter. Tommy continues to build up his reputation when Romano has a match against "Shortcut". Initially out boxing "Shortcut" with his footwork and speed, Romano is confident during the start of the fourth round. However, "Shortcut" secretly has his corner man apply a blinding fluid to his gloves in hopes of slowing down Romano. During the fourth round, Romano once again dominates "Shortcut" while Tommy watches and cheers him on. "Shortcut" then puts Romano in a headlock and rubs the fluid onto Romano\'s eyes giving him blurred vision. Unable to defend himself, "Shortcut" brutally beats Romano, until Tommy rings the bell in place of the distracted judges. Enraged by Short Cut\'s lack of sportsmanship, Tommy attacks Short Cut until they are broken apart. After this match, Tommy begins to search for Romano by searching through hospitals. It is not until Noah advises Tommy to search the hospital for the poor and indigent where he finally finds a beat up Romano in a coma and declared brain dead. Enraged by this, Tommy fights Short Cut in his next match. However, before the match starts, Tommy notices Short Cut rubbing his gloves together. When Shortcut tries to put Tommy into a headlock, Tommy lifts him up and slams him on the ground before fluid gets into his eyes. Defending himself from a kick, Tommy then punches Shortcut under the belt and proceeds to beat him into submission, but he stops short of the savagry Horn and Pappy Jack want him to display and he lets Short Cup drop to the mat. Later, Lincoln shows signs of possible brain damage as a result of a kick to the head, and is told to quit fighting for at least 60 days or else suffer permanent brain damage. Despite this, Horn arranges a match between Lincoln and Tommy with 20 grand to the winner. Afraid of killing Lincoln, Tommy takes a beating until Lincoln is unwilling to kill Tommy as he was earlier saved by him, saying "damn you to hell" due to his loss of his only livelihood. In revenge, Horn, a former boxer himself who lost only one fight, punches Lincoln severely enough to knock him out of the ring. Furious, Tommy challenges Horn to a match: If Horn wins, Tommy will continue to work for him indefinitely, but if Tommy wins, his father\'s debt is wiped clean. Horn accepts on the condition that they fight bare-knuckle. Horn\'s vast experience with boxing initially gives him the upper hand, and Horn\'s confidence influences him to play with and humiliate Tommy as a result. Tommy eventually uses the various forms of advice he\'s received throughout his brief boxing experience to outthink Horn: he fakes a broken hand to give Horn even more confidence, and then uses the element of surprise to finish him off, freeing himself from Horn\'s contract. Tommy and Lincoln shake hands, affirming their friendship. Tommy tells Noah, "Make your enemy think you are weak when you are really strong." Noah smiles as he hugs the champion Tommy.'] ["Brian Kelly  is a slacker at heart.

Most are preparing for university or far-off travel except for Joey Jeremiah  who is preparing for another year in high school. His longtime girlfriend Caitlin Ryan  has taken a number of extra classes and completed high school in three years and has graduated with Joey\'s former peers. Eager to hold on to her before she leaves for university to study journalism, Joey proposes to Caitlin at a graduation party hosted by Lucy Fernandez . Caitlin demurs, explaining that she is not ready for that kind of commitment. Joey storms out, only to run into classmate Tessa Campanelli  fresh from an argument with her boyfriend Todd , and agrees to give her a ride home. Arriving at the Campanelli house, Tessa pulls Joey toward her for a kiss. The next day, on a break from the photo shop where she works, Tessa visits Joey next door at the drug store where he works and asks him on a date. Joey, though initially hesitant, accepts Tessa\'s offer, has a great time, and, as he tells Wheels  the next day, gets to "third base." Tessa confides in her co-worker, Spike , the details of the relationship. Spike reminds her that Joey and Caitlin have a pattern of breaking up and reuniting. Tessa rejects Spike\'s argument, noting that Caitlin will be leaving for university in a matter of weeks anyway. With Caitlin working most evenings and weekends and Joey working days, they spend little time together and Joey starts seeing Tessa more frequently and they soon go all the way. As the summer goes on, Joey sees both Tessa and Caitlin with neither realizing he is dating them both. By the middle of August, Tessa discovers she is pregnant and decides to have an abortion. When she realizes that Joey is still with Caitlin with no intention of breaking up with her, she dumps him. Joey and Caitlin finally make love on his nineteenth birthday, approximately a week before Caitlin, Lucy, and Snake are all scheduled to depart for university. It\'s Caitlin\'s first time, though she is unaware that it is not Joey\'s. Unbeknownst to Joey, Caitlin has decided to attend a local university in order to remain close to him. The next day, at a lake house party, hosted by Lucy\'s boyfriend Bronco , Caitlin accepts Joey\'s earlier marriage proposal.

Immediately after unintentionally breaking up Joey and Caitlin, Snake realises that former classmate Allison Hunter  is drowning and rushes in to the lake to rescue her. Everyone congratulates him for saving her life, but he breaks down in a flood of emotion and anxiety. Wheels, who had been drinking heavily, leaves the party with Lucy to get more chips but ends up crashing into another car. The crash kills a two-year-old boy in the other car, and seriously injures Lucy. The next day, Joey visits Wheels in jail, where Wheels tells him he has been charged with one count of criminal negligence causing death, two counts of criminal negligence causing injury, and drunk driving. He asserts that it was not his fault that the child was not wearing a seatbelt or that Lucy wanted to get more chips. Caitlin visits Lucy at the hospital where she is immobilized and unsure if she will ever see or walk again. Later, Joey stops to see Snake as he prepares to leave for university and asks why he won\'t accept Wheels\' phone calls. Snake is disgusted by Wheels, particularly in light of Wheels having lost his own parents to a drunk driver. He apologizes to Joey for saying what he said at Bronco\'s place. Joey accepts his apology, saying that Caitlin would have found out sooner or later. Two months later, most of the gang get together for the wedding of Alexa Pappadopoulos  and Simon Dexter . Absent are Wheels, Erica , and Lucy. Wheels, still incarcerated, is planning to plead guilty for his crimes. Erica is teaching abroad in the Dominican Republic and has met a new boyfriend in the process.

Snake is accompanied by his girlfriend Pam  whom he met at university, and he appears considerably more self-assured; he is still vocally disgusted by Wheels. Both Snake and Caitlin are receptive to Joey\'s apologies for the way he had behaved toward them.

Haley was once considered one of the most talented gymnasts in the US. She made it to the World Championships, but she walked out of competition in the middle of the finals, costing the American team the gold medal and leaving many people hurt and crushed, making her one of the most hated people in gymnastics. Haley goes to the elite Vickerman Gymnastics Academy , her ultimate nightmare, run by legendary coach Burt Vickerman . Haley has a talk with Coach Vickerman, who convinces her to take up the sport once again&nbsp;– at least until she can enter an upcoming invitational competition. Vickerman convinces her that she can use the prize money from the competition to repay some property damage debts she still owes and leave gymnastics once and for all. Disliking the sport\'s rigid rules and intense training schedule, Haley is reluctant to come out of retirement. Her attitude toward her fellow gymnasts&nbsp;– as well as her past&nbsp;– causes conflicts. After getting the cold shoulder the first day at the gym, Haley realizes what she is up against. At the invitational, Haley\'s talent shines and her return from gymnastics retirement seems for the better. But all is not what it seems in the scoring system. She starts to remember one of the many reasons she retired&nbsp;– the flaws in judging. The panels do not look at the difficulty of the move nor do they look at the technique; they merely take deductions for unimportant minor errors. As Haley Graham says, "It doesn\'t matter how well you do. It\'s how well you follow their rules." In addition, Haley is severely stressed by her dominating mother, who has arrived to watch the meet. Her conduct at the World Championship  has not been forgotten by the other athletes, and they treat her with open hostility. Haley finally breaks down in the middle of her balance beam routine and, in a repeat of the World Championships, leaves the arena before completing the competition. Before she leaves, she reveals to Vickerman the reason she walked out of Worlds: she had just discovered that her mother was having an affair with her then-coach, and her parents were divorcing as a result. Although she did not complete the invitational, Haley continues to train and, with three of her teammates Mina , Wei Wei  and Joanne , qualifies for the National Championships. The biased judging leaves her far back in the all-around standings, but this does not keep her out of the event finals. In the first event final, vault, Mina executes an extremely difficult maneuver perfectly but receives a low score . When Vickerman questions the judges, he learns that Mina was deducted on the technicality of showing a bra strap. Haley is next up, however, instead of vaulting, she shows her bra strap to the judges and forfeits her turn in disgust . The other gymnasts follow suit, earning a string of zeroes and forcing the judges to award Mina the vault gold medal anyway. Haley\'s bold action sparks a movement. The gymnasts talk amongst themselves and realize that if they could choose the winner, the judging would be fair. They convince all the others in the competition to do the same, choosing one person from each event who they deem the best to be the "winner". The winner completes her routine; the others jump on and off the apparatus and scratch, while bra is not continuously out. It seems the movement will be ruined when Trisha Skilken, a long-time judges\' favorite, arrives and threatens the choice of winners by competing herself. Trisha finally comes to her senses, though, and realizes that scratching is for the good of the competition to make a point. What started out as a gymnastics competition turns into a small revolution for the rules and Haley. Her talents are recognized once more and her future seems to be set with numerous colleges offering her athletic scholarships to compete in NCAA gymnastics.'] ['The movie centers around Sabrina Sawyer , who is sent to live with her eccentric aunts in Riverdale.

Both Neil and Todd are under harsh parental pressure to become a doctor and a lawyer respectively, but Todd wants to be a writer, and Neil discovers a passion for acting. The teaching methods of their new English teacher, John Keating , are unorthodox by Welton standards, whistling the 1812 Overture and taking them out of the classroom to focus on the idea of carpe diem. He tells the students that they may call him "O Captain! My Captain!," in reference to a Walt Whitman poem, if they feel daring.

Lightning strikes a headstone, and when the smoke clears, they find a book without a name at the base of it. Ursula opens it to find that the pages contain no writing, except for a message inside the book’s cover that reads: “Who shall ever freely give thy soul to these pages will be requited with a power beyond their worth. Thy written word is thy bond.” Ursula decides to take it home, believing that fate has meant for her to find it. At school, Dominique, Ursula, and their friends Andy , Craig  and Effi ([[Lisa Tucker  are bullied by the antagonistic cheerleaders Heather , Georgia , and Lisa . Ursula wishes that Heather would fall on her head during a school pep rally, but Dominique says that she would be content if Heather just had both of her legs broken. After school, Ursula goes home and examines the book and its message again, and she writes, "I hate Heather and I wish she\'d break both of her perfect legs." Meanwhile, Dominique pays a visit to her father\'s grave and pours out her feelings to him. He had died a year earlier, and her mother Rene  is now married to Frank , a man she considers to be a creep. He recently got laid off from his job, forcing Rene to take up work as a stripper, and now she hardly sees her due to the hours she works. At school the next day, Dominique and Ursula witness Heather getting her legs crushed by two cars. Heather is taken to the hospital, and the principal decides to close the school for the day. The two girls go to Ursula\'s home, and upon arriving, Ursula admits that she is the one who broke Heather\'s legs because she wrote it in the book they found, and she doesn\'t feel any guilt over it. She tells Dominique that it happened because she believed in the book\'s power. Dominique mocks Ursula by asking her to write down that she wants bigger breasts, as well as give Heather\'s boyfriend, Kyle , a wicked case of acne. Though Ursula knows she is teasing her, she agrees to, anyway, to prove the book\'s powers to her. However, she writes for Kyle to get bad blisters instead. Dominique goes home, but finds that her breasts haven\'t grown larger, causing her to dismiss Ursula\'s notions. The next day, in Chemistry class, the class is doing an exam where they are handling corrosive liquids. As Kyle is heading towards his seat with some equipment needed for the exam, Joey  shoots a spitball at his face. This disorients him and makes him fall, and he knocks over a test tube containing one of the liquids, which splashes all over his face and badly burns him. The paramedics come and take him to the hospital, and Ursula laughs out loud over this, annoying Georgia and Joey. They confront her, but Ursula laughs at them, and Dominique tries to usher her away. Georgia throws an insult at Ursula, and she gets in Georgia\'s face and growls that she could cause her more pain than she could ever imagine. Dominique grabs Ursula and leaves. She takes her into a bathroom and comes down on her verbally for basically confessing to harming Kyle. Ursula takes the book out from her bag, where they notice that its cover now reads "Ephemeris Diaboli", and Ursula mentions that that name didn\'t appear there until she started writing in it. She then decides to write something for Joey, but Dominique tries to take the book away. Ursula holds it close and yells that she can\'t touch the book. Dominique then tells her that that book is having a negative effect on her, and shows her in the mirror that her skin has become pale and her eyes are now enveloped by black circles. Her true self comes through for a moment, reacting with shock at these changes, but when Dominique suggests that she get help, Ursula reverts back to her more sinister self and tells her that she won\'t give up the book. She then leaves, and Dominique takes off after her. Then, Lisa comes out of one of the stalls, having eavesdropped on the whole conversation. At home, Dominique finds out through a web search that "Ephemeris Diaboli" is Latin for "Devil\'s Diary", and this book only lands in the hands of the ambitious. Meanwhile, Georgia and Lisa pay Heather a visit at the hospital and tell her about what happened to Kyle and also about Ursula\'s book and the power it apparently possesses. Heather realizes that Ursula must have used it on her, and she tells the two that they need to come up with a plan to get the book. Dominique visits the local church headed by Father Mark Mulligan  to seek his help. She shows him a picture she printed off of the Internet of the Ephemeris Diaboli and asks if he\'s seen it. He says no, but his eyes clearly say something else. She tells him about how she learned that Satan had crafted the book and given it to the Pharaoh when Moses led his people out of Egypt, and whatever evil is written in it manifests itself in the real world. She points out that Ursula found it in the graveyard nearby, but Mulligan doesn\'t believe it, because if it were the real Ephemeris Diaboli, it would be thousands of years old now. Dominique insists that it is the same book, and Ursula has already written things in it and it was changing her for the worse. All Mulligan can tell her is to stop her from writing in the book, and even get it away from her if possible, and gives her some comfort by saying that he will call for someone in the church who would know more about this. Around the same time, Ursula, once again, writes inside the Ephemeris Diaboli, wishing for Joey to lose his eyes. At a pool hall, Joey is playing with some friends, and a friend accidentally stabs him in the eyes with a broken cue. The next day, Dominique goes to school, where her friend Effi tells her about what happened to Joey. Ursula, meanwhile, is at home, and she targets Steve Kowalski next, writing for him to burn in Hell. Dominique meets with Effi, Andy, and Craig at lunchtime and fills them in on the Ephemeris Diaboli. They find it hard to believe, but then a fire alarm sounds, and they all soon find out that Steve had suddenly burst into flames while welding and ended up being burned alive. Andy, Craig, and Effi now believe Dominique and ask her to fill them in again on the book. Later on, Father Mulligan greets arriving priest Father Sanchez , an expert on the Ephemeris Diaboli, and fills him in on the situation. Father Sanchez warns that the book has started spreading its evil and will soon move into the hands of one with more ambition. Georgia, Lisa, and their friend Nate  drive up to Ursula\'s home, where the girls plan to distract her while Nate sneaks into her bedroom and snatches the book. Despite a really close call, they succeed. They head back to school, where Lisa points out that the pages are mysteriously all blank. She and Georgia later head to the hospital to visit Heather, but Georgia stops outside her room and says to Lisa that maybe they should keep it and tell Heather that they never found it. Lisa refuses to go along with it, and Georgia reluctantly presents the book to Heather. Heather gives the book back to Georgia and tells her to write down that Ursula deserves to lose all of her teeth and hair and choke on her own vomit. At that moment, Dominique stops by Ursula\'s house to check on her, and she finds Ursula crying, holding her teeth and locks of her hair in her hands. She tells Dominique that "they" wrote in it, and then starts violently vomiting. Dominique rushes Ursula to the bathroom, and then Andy, Craig, and Effi show up. Dominique has Effi call an ambulance, and tells Andy and Craig that Heather or Georgia must have the book now. Just then, the bathroom door shuts and locks by itself, and no matter how hard Dominique and her friends try, they can\'t get in to help Ursula, who starts violently convulsing and screaming. When the door finally opens, Ursula is found dead on the floor. Dominique heads back to the church that night to speak with Fathers Mulligan and Sanchez, and the latter explains that when Ursula started writing in the book, she sold her soul to Satan, and the same fate will befall anyone else who writes on its pages. She asks how the book can be destroyed, but Sanchez replies that it can\'t be destroyed any more than man can destroy evil itself. He tells her that she must bring the book to the church. Meanwhile, Georgia examines the book at her house, and initially ignores all calls from Heather, until she gets irritated and answers one. She tells Georgia that Lisa and Nate told her that Ursula died in the exact way it was written down in the book. Convinced of the book\'s power, Georgia hangs up on her, and after looking at Heather in a cheerleading photo, she writes for Heather to have a "tragic accident." Later on, the cord from Heather\'s call button acts on its own, wrapping itself around the sleeping Heather\'s neck and strangling her to death. After feeling it happen, Georgia writes down that she wants a body to kill for and for every guy who sees her to want her desperately. The next day at school, Georgia - looking noticeably darker in appearance - has all of the guys fawning over her as she passes them, and they are so smitten with her that they start fighting each other over her. Lisa notices this right away, and goes up to Georgia and demands to know if she wrote for all of this to happen. Georgia just angrily replies that she is just jealous of her, and makes it clear to her that she doesn\'t care about the fighting taking place. Lisa tells her that she needs to put a stop to all of it, but Georgia refuses to listen, warning her that she needs to get on board with this or else lose her head. Scared, Lisa turns to Dominique and her friends, informing them that Georgia has been writing in the book and has to be stopped. Outside, the group sees Georgia flirting with several students, and Dominique tells her that she knows that she used the book to kill Ursula. Georgia sarcastically offers her condolences and tells Dominique that she\'ll make it up to her by making her a desirable woman like herself. Dominique refuses, and as Georgia walks off for somewhere, Andy and Craig clearly show that they have fallen under Georgia\'s spell like all of the other guys. Knowing where Georgia has walked off to, Lisa leads the group  to an entrance to a set of stairs heading for a secret make-up room where she, Georgia, and Heather would frequently hang out. Lisa tells Andy, Craig, and Effi to wait at the entrance to stop Georgia in case if she gets by her, but Effi volunteers to come with her out of loyalty to Dominique. When they arrive at the make-up room, Lisa goes in first, and she finds Georgia writing in the book. Georgia tells her that she now views Lisa as a threat and can\'t trust her to keep her head. Lisa shoves her to the floor and gets hold of the book, but Georgia beats her down. She manages to get the book to Effi, who escapes down the corridor. Georgia goes after her, but Lisa catches up with Georgia and tries to tell her that the book is evil. Georgia shoves her down and then forces a stagelight to wobble and drop onto her, electrocuting her. Effi screams in terror, which enables Georgia to find her and start strangling her. She manages to slide the book towards an arriving Dominique, who runs off with it. As she passes Andy and Craig, she tells them to stop Georgia, but Georgia easily gets past them by using her powers to make them kiss each other, saying that that turns her on. Georgia chases Dominique through the empty school until she traps her inside the cafeteria courtyard. Andy and Craig catch up to them, but Georgia takes over their minds again, and commands them to kill Dominique and get the book back for her. As the guys close in on her, she starts ripping pages out of the book, causing Georgia to experience pains in her abdomen. Out of desperation, Dominique throws the book away from Andy and Craig, where it smacks against a nearby wall. Strangely, at the same time this occurs, Georgia goes flying as well, and she smacks her head against a nearby wall and dies instantly. Dominique can only react with horror. Dominique goes back home with the Ephemeris Diaboli and examines it in her room, but soon discovers Frank has been watching her. He then notices the book, and he takes it from her and starts looking at it. Frank then tries to rape her, and Dominique pretends to play along with it, and then hits him when his guard is down and gets the book back. Dominique then locks him out of her room, and as he tries to force the door open, she opens the book and writes that she wants Frank to die. Frank grabs a pair of scissors and picks the lock open, but soon after he gets in, the book’s power makes him stab himself in the neck with the scissors, killing him. Dominique looks inside the book afterwards and finds that her message has disappeared, and begins crying, knowing that she has given in to its power. Dominique goes back to Father Mulligan with the book in hand. She begs for him to take the book, saying that the book is talking to her and telling her things she thinks about. He refuses, but tells her to wait outside while he fetched Father Sanchez. While he tells him that Dominique has come with the book, Dominique heads to her father\'s headstone in the graveyard. Mulligan and Sanchez find her there, where she is repeatedly begging her deceased father to help her because she doesn\'t want to give them the book. Mulligan tells her that Sanchez knows how to get rid of it and must give it to him, but Dominique frightfully refuses, saying that he wants it. Not believing her, Mulligan and Sanchez wrench the book from her grip, and Sanchez leaves with it. Dominique tells Mulligan that Sanchez truly does want the book because she could feel it when he took it, and the book has chosen him because he is more ambitious than Georgia was. Mulligan tells her to go straight home and wait for him, and then he leaves to confront Sanchez. When he catches up with him outside the church, Sanchez uses the book\'s powers to hurt him internally, and then impales his palms against a church wall with iron spikes from the cemetery’s gate. Dominique shows up and tries to help Mulligan, but Sanchez telekinetically pushes her against the wall. He tries to convince her to give her soul to the book and become immortal with him. She agrees, but only if the dying Mulligan is set free. Sanchez does so, and Dominique takes one of the spikes from Mulligan\'s palms. Sanchez tells her that he can feel her hate, and telekinetically forces her to raise the spike up high. He then commands her to stab him with all of the hatred in her heart to consummate their union. Dominique drives the spike through the book instead, and Sanchez becomes engulfed in the flames of Hell and killed. The epilogue takes place 6 weeks later. Dominique is now in a mental hospital since she wouldn\'t stop talking about the Ephemeris Diaboli. Her mother visits her, telling her that she quit stripping and got a job in retail, and then tearfully tells her that if she was ever going to get her out of this place, she needed to stop talking about the book. Dominique rambles about the book again and shows her mother some pictures she drew that were influenced by the book, causing her to get upset and ask Dominique if she wants to spend the rest of her life in here. Then, Dominique has a frightening vision of two boys going through the graveyard at that very moment, and one of them finds the Ephemeris Diaboli buried in the ground and takes it. Dominique says to the camera, "It\'s alive again", and the scene cuts to black with a scream.'] ['Precocious, bohemian teenager Placid Lake finishes high school, but after having an existential crisis devises a plan to totally reinvent himself as a functioning member of society.

Through their jobs of life-guarding kiddie pools and working at Turkish restaurants they manage to save $847.53, more than enough to cross California in their Joyota, a reconstructed jeep with a rebuilt Toyota engine. Never having so much freedom in their lives, they decide to go to Mexico where they surf the fierce and unpredictable waves of Larosarita. Unexpectedly, Corey receives a phone call and is told of the death of his grandfather, "Grandpa G."

Corey then makes a bet with Brian that by the end of the trip, he will not be able to get Jessie to do one thing he wants her to do. As the trip continues, through a series of paintball fights and late night phone calls, Jessie and Brian get closer and closer. Having been hurt in the past, Jessie has a hard time trusting Brian and his intentions toward her.

Corey\'s stepdad turns out to be a nightmare, as the only inheritance Corey was left with was a junked-out car. With no way of getting home, the only option they have is to sell the car and hope they get enough money for the trip home.

With the help of Grandma G, they sell the car left by Grandpa G online for $1,500. Only one thing can make this a good ending: having Jessie back. Brian knows he messed up with Jessie and is truly sorry for what he\'s done. In a last attempt to get her back, Brian and the guys head to the University of Washington where she is giving a freshman orientation. Brian apologizes for what he did, telling Jessie that he\'s never known anyone like her &mdash; she woke him up. He asks her to come with them, but she tearfully says that she can\'t just get up and go. Matt gives her her plane ticket before the four friends leave. With hope, Brian waits at the airport for Jessie, but she does not come. As he sits in his seat, his phone starts ringing; it is Jessie, who is sitting in the back of the plane.'] ["One night, Caleb Colton , a young man in a small town, meets an attractive young drifter named Mae .

Upon conviction, his family is fined with $45,000 and he is banned from owning or operating computers or touch-tone telephones until his 18th birthday. Shortly before Dade  turns 18, his mother  takes a job in New York City. Upon turning 18, Dade calls a local television station, dupes the security guard into giving him the modem\'s phone number (a tactic known as [[Social engineering  and successfully hacks into the station\'s computer network, changing the current TV program to an episode of The Outer Limits. However, Dade is "attacked" by a hacker  on the same network. During the conversation, Dade identifies himself by the new alias, Crash Override, to hide his old alias as Zero Cool. Dade enrolls at Stanton High School, where he meets Kate Libby , who is assigned to take him on a tour of the school. After Dade learns that Kate is "Acid Burn", they feud over who is the better hacker. The real trouble begins when Joey Pardella , the novice hacker of the group, successfully breaks into an Ellingson Mineral Company supercomputer  to prove to the rest of the group that he is an elite hacker. To validate this feat, he downloads part of a garbage file. Unfortunately, the company\'s IT employee Hal  detects this unauthorized entry and summons computer security officer Eugene "The Plague" Belford  to deal with the problem. He realizes the file being downloaded can prove that The Plague is stealing from the company via salami slicing. The Plague enlists the U.S. Secret Service to recover the file by claiming that it is the code to Da Vinci, a computer virus that will capsize the company\'s oil tanker fleet and he needs that code to destroy the virus. Joey is arrested and his computer is searched, but the Secret Service finds nothing, as Joey has hidden the disk containing the files. In response, Dade and Kate decide to settle their disagreements with a hacking duel, with hacks focused on harassing Secret Service Agent Richard Gill , a known enemy of hackers, who was involved in Joey\'s arrest. Kate and Dade\'s hacker friends—Ramon Sanchez a.k.a. "The Phantom Phreak," Emmanuel Goldstein a.k.a. "Cereal Killer", and Paul Cook a.k.a. "Lord Nikon" —act as judges. After being released on parole, Joey reveals the disk to Phantom Phreak in a public park; but they quickly realize that they are being followed by the Secret Service. The next day, Phreak is arrested. He uses his phone call to inform Kate that he hid the disk in a boy\'s bathroom at school. That evening, Kate and Cereal Killer ask Dade for his help; but, because of his record, he declines. Kate then asks Dade to copy the disk so that, if anyone else is arrested, they have the disk as evidence. After determining that Dade is not the one who hacked into Ellingson, The Plague attempts to enlist Dade\'s help to find the one who did. First, he offers Dade a free high-powered laptop. Later, he threatens to have Dade\'s mother incarcerated with a manufactured criminal record. At this, Dade agrees to deliver Kate\'s copy of the disk. Meanwhile, Kate, Lord Nikon, and Cereal Killer attempt to discern the contents of the disk. Dade joins them; and, after working all night, they learn the truth—it\'s designed to salami-slice $25 million from Ellingson transactions. Dade reveals that he knows Plague is behind this scheme, because he was the one who wanted Kate\'s copy of the disk. He admits he gave Plague the disk and reveals his history as Zero Cool. Determined to stop the scheme, the assembled hackers plan to hack the Gibson again. Kate and Dade go dumpster-diving for employee memos with passwords; Cereal Killer installs a hidden microphone in the Ellingson offices; and Nikon poses as a delivery boy wandering the Ellingson cubicles, memorizing employee passwords as they enter them. From the memos, they discover the Da Vinci virus is set to capsize the oil fleet the next day, which would provide the perfect cover to distract from the salami-slicing worm. In need of help, they seek out Razor and Blade, the producers of a hacker-themed pirate TV show, "Hack the Planet." The next morning, they evade the Secret Service and converge on Grand Central station, where they use payphones to begin their assault on the Gibson. At first, their attempts are easily rebuffed by Plague, who calls Dade to warn him to escape before he is arrested. However, Razor and Blade have contacted hackers around the world, who lend their support with virus attacks, distracting Plague long enough for Dade to download the incriminating file to a floppy disk. Shortly after crashing the Gibson, Dade and company are arrested. As they\'re being led away, Dade surreptitiously informs Cereal Killer, hiding in the crowd, that he\'s tossed the disk in a trashcan. As Dade and Kate are being interrogated, Razor and Blade jam the local television signals and broadcast live video of Cereal Killer, revealing the plot and Plague\'s complicity. Plague is arrested when he tries to flee to Japan under the alias "Mr. Babbage" . Their names cleared, Dade and Kate go on a date. Kate even wears a dress. While relaxing in a pool on the roof of a building, their friends show off their latest hack—the lights in several adjacent office buildings spell out "CRASH AND BURN."'] ['On April 1, 2007, Desiree Cartier is hosting a party at her mansion for her friend actress, Torrance Caldwell. Present for a pre-festivities toast are - Blaine Cartier, Desiree\'s brother, who controls their joint inheritance , U.S. Senate candidate Peter Welling, Peter\'s "Miss Carolina" fiancee Barbie Reynolds, and the quintet\'s less wealthy videographer friend Ryan. With the party in full swing, Desiree\'s social nemesis and Ryan\'s not-so-secret crush Milan Hastings, arrives. Also present is chihuahua-toting society reporter Charles. As another in her long string of April Fool\'s pranks, Desiree suggests Blaine get Milan tipsy on champagne and pork her in his bedroom upstairs. Desiree and several of the others hover by the cracked-open bedroom door, prepared to videotape the affair with the camera Desiree lifted from Ryan. However, Milan has a seizure and falls off the balcony to her death. The group goes to court, and Blaine loses the control of the family\'s fortune which shifts to Desiree, but they are considered innocent and the death of Milan is considered a fatal prank. One year later, Desiree, Blaine, Peter, Barbie, Torrance, and Ryan receive anonymous invitations to meet on Milan\'s grave at noon, April 1, 2008, with the cryptic P.S. "I have proof." Just after the entire sextet is back together, a messenger comes to the grave with a box containing a letter and a laptop computer. The letter says one of the six murdered Milan, and if that person does not confess, all of them will be dead by midnight. As a show of intent, the computer has footage of Charles drowning in his pool. Everyone goes from the cemetery to the pool to confirm this mishap. Subsequently, an increasingly frantic Desiree sees one "suspect" after another "murdered" before her eyes . Barbie is electrocuted in a beauty pageant dressing room, Peter\'s campaign truck runs him down in a parking garage, Ryan\'s throat is slit in his humble apartment, and returning home, Desiree and Blaine discover even their long-time butler Wilford has been butchered in the kitchen. After a brief separation from her brother, Desiree finds him tied to a chair. Worse yet, gun-wielding Torrance soon has Desiree tied inches away in another chair. After some back and forth, and Torrance fatally shooting Blaine in the chest, a chagrined Desiree finally admits it was she who spiked Milan\'s fatal drink, while allowing brother Blaine to become the "fall guy." At this point Blaine cannot contain a chuckle, and soon the whole crew of 2008 "victims" are surrounding a still-tied Desiree, telling her what a bitch she is, and how they have conspired to prove it to her. Special effects people from Torrance\'s Boogie Nights 2 set have equipped Blaine and the others with "squibs," and other cast members faked Desiree out by dressing as cops and "confirming" Ryan\'s murder as she and her brother were fleeing the scene. To illustrate her end of the charade involving a revolver shooting blanks, Torrance pulls the trigger once more. Unfortunately for Desiree, this time the cartridge in the chamber is real, and the bullet blows off the top of her head. The next scene involves the same inquest-probate judge from a year earlier absolving Torrance of any guilt for Desiree\'s death, and confirming Blaine as sole heir of the family estate. The final scene shows Blaine driving off in what was Desiree\'s red Mercedes, a slowly building smirk on his face.'] ['A straight bass player in an "all gay band" called The Jerk-Offs, Nick O\'Leary , a teenager from Hoboken, New Jersey, is heartbroken after his girlfriend, Tris , breaks up with him, and continues to make her "breakup" mix CDs.

A brawl ensues between Toby's gang and another gang, which ends with both sides fleeing just before police arrive. Later that night, Toby's gang goes to a party at Eric's house, and Allison's relationship with Toby as well her other friends Emily  and Sam  is further revealed. At the end of the party, Allison and her boyfriend have sex in the back seat of the car. The next day, Allison meets with her father  at work to discuss family problems, the awkward conversation revealing the virtually non-existent relationship Allison has with her parents. Afterwards, she and her friends drive downtown into East LA, intent on buying marijuana, eventually encountering Mexican drug dealer Hector ([[Freddy Rodriguez  and his crew. Toby and Hector make a deal, but Toby believes that Hector did not sell him enough for what he paid, and attempts to confront Hector, who pulls a gun on him, humiliating him in front of his friends. Allison persuades Hector to leave Toby alone. The next night, Allison and her girlfriends return to the location of the drug deal. There, she and her friends once again meet up with Hector and his crew, who invite them to a party at his house. Before they leave, Hector informs Allison of a motel where his crew regularly party, and invites her to stop by if she wishes. The next day, Eric continues his film project at Allison's home, with Allison turning his interview of her into a bizarre mind-game. That evening, Allison meets up with Hector again in a store, and he shows her around his neighborhood, while talking about his family and lifestyle. His guided tour abruptly ends when the police arrive in force, ostensibly on a drug bust. Allison winds up being arrested with the other present gang members, but – save for an argument with her parents and Toby – is let off the hook. The experience only serves to increase Allison's fascination with the inner-city lifestyle. The night after her release, Allison and Emily agree to head downtown the next evening to hang out with Hector's crew. The two meet up with Hector and his gang at a motel, and a night of partying and drinking results in Allison and Emily asking Hector if they can join his crew. Hector informs them of their initiation; to join the gang, the two must roll a die; the number they roll corresponds to the number of gang members they must have sex with. Allison rolls a one, Emily rolls a three. Hector and Allison pair off, but Allison has second thoughts and refuses to have sex with him, and is thrown out of the room by the gang when she tries to get Emily to leave with her. Emily eagerly engages in sex with Hector, but as she does so, Hector has one of his fellow gang members copulate with her anally, against her will. When Allison storms the room and screams at the men to stop, they flee the room, leaving the two distraught women. The next day Allison returns to the motel and confronts Hector over what had happened the previous night. Hector responds by saying he didn't do anything wrong, that he only did what she and Emily asked him to do. At that moment a woman shows up at the door, surprising Allison, much to the amusement of Hector, who mocks Allison for thinking he had feelings for her, and calling her a poser who only knows how to play games and nothing about the realities of gang life. The same day, Emily is shown at a police station, accusing Hector and his crew of gang rape. Allison is brought in for questioning, but claims to know nothing about a rape. Hector is subsequently arrested, and members of his crew vow to seek out and silence Allison and Emily, but wind up getting lost in Bel-Air. Meanwhile, Toby and his gang are shown posing with guns in front of Eric and his video camera, making clear their intent on seeking revenge on Hector's crew. Eric later shows Allison the footage, and Allison subsequently calls Toby and makes an ill-fated attempt to convince him that there was no rape and what he is doing is foolish. Allison informs Emily of what Toby plans to do, and reveals to Emily's parents the events at the motel. This initially upsets Emily to the point of nearly attempting suicide, but eventually the two reconcile. Meanwhile, Toby and his gang arrive at Hector's motel and bust in violently, but only succeed in frightening a group of Latino women and a baby. Toby tries to work up the nerve to shoot them, but, consumed by their desperate pleads to not hurt the baby, realizes he can't and storms out. On their drive home, the gang passes the SUV containing the members of Hector's crew that had been looking for Allison and Emily. The two gangs exchange looks, and the screen subsequently fades to black. After a few seconds the sounds of tires squealing, people shouting and gunfire are heard. Eric concludes his film with Allison saying that teens will be teens, but if adults are willing to reach out to them to connect and give them even just a small amount of insight, it's like they suddenly know everything."] ['In 2008, Jason Voorhees is captured by the United States government and held at the Crystal Lake Research Facility. In 2010, Rowan LaFontaine, a government scientist, decides to place Jason in cryogenic suspension after several attempts to kill him. While Private Samuel Johnson places a blanket on Jason, Doctor Aloysius Bartholomew Wimmer, Sergeant Marcus, and a few soldiers hope to further research Jason\'s rapid cellular regeneration and try to take Jason. They pull off the blanket covering his body, but find Johnson dead instead. Having broken free of his restraints, Jason kills the soldiers. Rowan lures Jason into a cryonic pod and activates it. However, Jason ruptures the pod with his machete and stabs Rowan in the abdomen, spilling cryonic fluid into the sealed room and freezing them both. In the year 2455, Earth has become too polluted to support life and humanity has moved to a new planet, Earth Two. Three students, Tsunaron, Janessa and Azrael are on a field trip led by Professor Brandon Lowe who is accompanied by an android, KM-14. They enter the Crystal Lake facility and find the still frozen Jason and Rowan, whom they bring to their spaceship, the Grendel. Also on the ship are Lowe\'s remaining students, Kinsa, Waylander and Stoney. They reanimate Rowan while Jason is pronounced dead and left in the morgue. Lowe\'s intern, Adrienne, is ordered to dissect Jason\'s body. Lowe, who is in serious debt, calls his financial backer Dieter Perez of the Solaris, who notes that Jason\'s body could be worth a substantial amount to a collector. While Stoney has sex with Kinsa, Jason comes back to life and attacks Adrienne and then freezes her face with liquid nitrogen before smashing her head on a counter. Jason takes a machete-shaped surgical tool and makes his way through the ship. He stabs Stoney in the chest and drags him away, to Kinsa\'s horror. Sergeant Brodski leads a group of soldiers to attack Jason. Meanwhile, Jason attacks and kills Dallas and Azrael. He then tries to attack Crutch, but Brodski and his soldiers save him. Jason disappears, and after Brodski splits up his team, Jason kills them. Lowe orders Pilot Lou to dock in on Solaris. As he is talking with the Solaris engineer, he is killed by Jason. With no pilot, the ship crashes through a nearby space station, destroying it, and killing Dieter Perez and everyone else on the Solaris. The crash damages one of the Grendels pontoon sections. Jason breaks into the lab, reclaims his machete and decapitates Lowe. With the ship badly damaged, the remaining survivors head for Grendels shuttle, while Tsunaron heads elsewhere with KM-14. After finding Lou\'s remains, Crutch and Waylander prepare the shuttle. Rowan finds Brodski, but he is too heavy for her to carry, so she leaves to get help. Waylander leaves to help with him, while Crutch prepares the shuttle. Jason kills Crutch. On board the shuttle, Kinsa has a panic attack and launches the shuttle without releasing the fuel line, causing it to crash into the ship\'s hull and explode. Brodski attacks Jason, but is overpowered. Tsunaron reappears with an upgraded KM-14, complete with an array of weapons and new combat skills. She fights Jason off and seemingly kills him, knocking him into a nanite-equipped medical station, and blasting off his right arm, left leg, his right rib cage and finally part of his head. The survivors send a distress call and receive a reply from a patrol shuttle. The survivors set explosive charges to separate the remaining pontoon from the main drive section. As they work, Jason is brought back to life by the damaged medical station, rebuilt as an even more powerful cyborg called Uber-Jason. Jason easily defeats KM-14 by punching her head off. As Tsunaron picks up her still functioning head, Jason attacks them, but is stopped by Waylander, who sacrifices himself by setting off the charges while the others escape. Jason survives and is blown back onto the shuttle. He punches a hole through the hull, sucking out Janessa. A power failure with the docking door forces Brodski to go EVA to fix it. Meanwhile, a hard light holographic simulation of Crystal Lake is created to distract Jason, but he sees through the deception just as the door is fixed. Brodski confronts Jason so the rest can escape. As they leave, the pontoon explodes, propelling Jason at high-speed towards the survivors, however, Brodski intercepts Jason in mid-flight and manoeuvres them both into the atmosphere of Earth Two, incinerating them. Tsunaron assures KM-14 that he will build a new body for her. On the planet, two teens beside a lake see a "falling star" as Jason\'s charred mask sinks to the bottom of the lake.'] ["A few months ago Dan had to make a choice.

As she is about to leave for school, she is brutally murdered by someone dressed as Cinderhella, the serial killer from a fictional horror film series Taylor mentions. The scene shifts to Riley Jones, a cynical outcast, who has a broken leg and a poster above her bed of the only person she considers to be a bigger loser than herself – a girl who performed oral sex on the stuffed grizzly bear school mascot in 1992. She makes an attempt on her life with a pill overdose, before hearing a song she loves on the radio and nearly missing the bus. She is forced to walk, and on the way is robbed of her iPod by an unnamed hipster. She arrives late to school where the audience is introduced to Clapton Davis, a slacker hipster liked by virtually everyone who Riley has a crush on, Ione Foster, the cheerleader former best friend of Riley and current girlfriend of Clapton, Sander Sanderson, Clapton\'s friend who openly makes attempts to have sex with Riley, and Billy Nolan, the school jock and ex-boyfriend of Ione, who is still obsessed with her. Billy challenges Clapton to a fight after school for the right to date Ione. Later, as Clapton accidentally sets off the indoor sprinker system he has a flashback to one week earlier – Principal Verge, who strongly dislikes Clapton for his care-free attitude, informs him that unless he can get an A or save the world by prom, he will not graduate. Since Taylor is absent , Ione is assigned as head cheerleader for the playoff game and Riley as the school mascot. Riley loses a debate on the ethics of eating meat to Canadian exchange student Gord, who beats her with claims that humans will lose their place in the food chain but that it is only right to eat baby animals. In the cafeteria, Sander attempts to comfort her by telling her \'at least you\'re not the girl who fucked the bear\', but she is unconvinced. Riley attempts to hang herself in front of the school\'s stuffed grizzly bear, but again changes her mind, as she tries to get down, she is attacked by Cinderhella with an axe and almost strangled, but she is saved when the bell rings and Cinderhella flees While Billy and Clapton\'s fight is about to start, the police arrive to inform the students of Taylor\'s murder. Riley tries to convince the police of her attack, but they do not believe her. At home, Riley is again attacked and manages to escape by running through her neighbours backyards and falling into a pool. The police arrive but still remain skeptical due to the similarities of her attacker to both of the movies Cinderhella and Scream. Clapton arrives to comfort her and invites Riley to see Cinderhella 2, with Ione. They are almost kicked out for arguing and taking pictures, and afterwards, Ione, with Sander and Clapton present, reasons that she is more likely to be murdered by Cinderhella than Riley because of her popularity and financial class. This results in a food fight and a flashback to six months before, where Ione is seen encouraging Riley to ask Clapton out, and the one to a month previously, where Ione ignores Rileys feelings for Clapton and makes clear her intentions to pursue him. During the football game, Billy\'s hand oozes a white slime that causes the ball to stick to his hand. He crashes into Riley, who sees the ooze as well as Billy vomiting acid. In the locker room, Billy confesses to Riley that he is part fly. He explains that as a child he found a meteor that, when he touched it, deformed his right hand. His father, not wanting people to know his son was "a freak", placed a T.V. set on it to cover it up. He suffered much ridicule until recently when he removed it to find his hand healed. However, he began to exhibit fly like symptoms, including growing wings, incredible strength and vomiting acid. Afterwards, at a "costume party" hosted at Sander\'s house, where only Sander and Riley dress up , Riley gets very drunk after seeing Clapton kissing Ione and begins to make out with Sander in an attempt to make Clapton jealous. He gets his hand caught in her overalls while groping her, and her breast pops out. The whole event is being recorded, and posted online, by an onlooker. Billy calls out for Clapton to fight him, but Ione berates and humiliates him by saying that his semen glows in the dark. Angered, he goes to an upstairs bedroom as he begins to exhibit fly mutations. Cinderhella attacks him from behind and dismembers him with an ax. Because of the murders as well as Riley\'s "snuff porno", Principal Verge makes all of the students who he believes to be suspects attend Saturday detention, from 10:00 AM to 10:00 PM on the same night as prom. Clapton, Ione, Riley, and Sander are joined by Mimi, the local goth, Toshiba, the "smartest or weirdest kid in school" who has a crush on Mimi, Gord, and Toby T, a loner who rarely says anything. While trying to figure out who the killer is, the group comes to the conclusion that none of them could be the killer. Gord because usually Canadians do not kill outside of Canada, Sander because he is too weak to use an ax, Mimi because she simply doesn\'t care, Toshiba for being Toshiba, Clapton and Ione because they are always together, Riley because she had a broken leg during one of the murders, and Toby T because he is just boring. Riley suddenly notices a student in a hoodie sitting among them. He tells them his name is Elliot Fink and that he has been in detention since 1992, but cannot remember what for. He recognizes Ione as being in detention in 1992 as well, but can\'t explain how. In a flashback, it is revealed that in order to win the school dance-off, Ione switched minds with her mother Sloane\'s teen self in 1992 through unknown alien means. Seeing how easy it is to be popular in the past, she opted to stay. This explains "Ione"s sudden interest in Clapton, his mutual attraction to her, her recent habit of making 90\'s pop references, and the collapse of her and Riley\'s friendship. As the scene returns to the present, Riley finds a bloody teddy bear and shoe, belonging to Taylor, on her desk. Realizing the killer is in fact one of them, they decide to watch the pirated Cinderhella 3 to see what the killer will do. The movie, a parody of their own situation with many movies-within-movies, finishes and the students all scream thinking they are about to be mass murdered. Principal Verge comes into the room warning the students to not make any commotion. When he leaves, however, Gord is seen impaled to the door by the ceiling fan. Verge hears the students screams and is cut in half by the murderer. As the students barricade the door, Elliot finishes carving an equation written in his notebook onto his desk and comes to the conclusion that the world is going to end in ten minutes. However, it is ten minutes in 1992. He hypothesizes that one of them must have time-traveled to 1992 and caused an explosion that would lead to re-writing of the future. Toshiba reveals that he has been converting the school bear\'s organic superconductive magnets  into a time machine for his Quantum Physics class project. At the same time, both Clapton and Sander are missing. The group believes that Clapton, being afraid to face the future as well as hating Verge and Billy, both murder victims, went into the past to stop the future from happening. Riley uses the time machine to follow Clapton to 1992 and stop him. When she finds him he confesses that he followed Sander through the time machine, has been attending school for six weeks, and is in fact on the Honor Roll, his teachers giving him good grades because his incorrect answers had "heart". Clapton realizes that teen Verge, being rejected by Ione in her mother\'s body, is making a bomb in science class, and Sander is helping him because Riley is only interested in Clapton and also believes everyone in town is lame. It is meant to just blow up in his face and leave him with a scar, but with Sander\'s help it will be successful. They find Sander and Verge before the bomb is triggered and drag Sander back to the time machine. Verge was still able to make the bomb go off, having been given all the information he needed. Clapton and Riley travel back six minutes before the bomb is triggered and decide the only way to stop Verge is to have Ione, as Sloane, take him to prom. They find her and her friendship with Riley is restored, but Clapton realizes he is interested in Ione\'s mother and ends the relationship. Ione reluctantly asks Verge to prom and he accepts. Sander tries to detonate the bomb himself, but only manages to blow himself up. Clapton and Riley return to the present. It has drastically change where Verge is still alive and with "Sloan". Verge is also apart of a band with Toshiba, Mimi, Gord, and Toby T. It is prom and Clapton and Riley are finally dating. As they are about to share their first kiss in the hallway, they discover from a memorial they hadn\'t noticed that Billy and Taylor were still murdered. Sander is revealed to be the killer and tries to kill both of them. Clapton and Sander fight but Sander stabs him in the back. Sander breaks Rileys leg once more, and has he moves to cut off Rileys head, the magnetic pull on the bear/time machine is activated. Many sharp metal objects are pulled to the bear, and Riley and Sander are pulled slowly towards it to, due Sanders tight hold on his ax. Riley steps forward on her broken bone to force Sander to let go of her, and he is impaled by spikes sticking out of the bear. As Riley and an injured Clapton look on, Riley narrates that high school is not the end of the world while Gord announces on national T.V. he is, in fact, a vegetable based alien who became a Canadian to help invade Earth because vegans eat their kind.'] ['Young sci-fi/fantasy enthusiast Gavin Gore  and his ragtag group of nerd friends, girlfriend Sophie Suchowski , swordsman Hobie Plumber , and young Maynard Keyes  stumble upon some "large tracks" and a "big ole sasquatch dumplin\'" whilst walking some trails in the nearby woods.

His parents are often fighting; his father  often tries to defend Jim, but Jim\'s mother always wins the arguments. Jim feels betrayed both by this fighting and his father\'s lack of moral strength, causing feelings of unrest and displacement. This shows up later in the film when he repeatedly asks his father, "What do you do when you have to be a man?"

Plato experiences many of the same problems as Jim, such as searching for meaning in life and dealing with parents who "don\'t understand." Jim meets Judy , whom he also recognizes from the police station, where she was brought in for being out alone after dark. She originally seems unimpressed by Jim, saying in a sarcastic tone, "I bet you\'re a real yo-yo." She is apparently the property of Buzz. Jim goes on a field trip to the Griffith Observatory.

He is fatally shot by a police officer as Jim yells to the police, too late, that he had already removed the bullets. Plato was wearing Jim\'s jacket at the time, and as a result, Jim\'s parents  think at first that Jim was shot. Mr. Stark then runs to comfort Jim, openly weeping for Plato\'s death. Mr. Stark promises to be a stronger father, one that his son can depend on. Thus reconciled, Jim introduces Judy to his parents.'] ['A meteorite crashes near the town of Arborville, California; an elderly transient discovers, within the sphere, a jelly-like substance  that attaches itself to his hand.

He later comes to Clifford to ask for money, ostensibly to pay for pulling the motorcycle out of the lagoon. Feeling used, Clifford follows him and the two argue before Ricky reveals to Clifford that he accidentally shot his brother while babysitting him at home. He is overwhelmed with guilt and remorse, and not the tough guy he seems. Moody and Mike later return to the park to further bully the other children. Unbeknownst to them, Ricky is also there retrieving his motorcycle. As Ricky attempts to leave with the bike, Moody notices and announces that the motorcycle now belongs to him. Ricky refuses the demand, so Moody summons Mike and the two begin to fight. Ricky gains the upper hand before Moody jumps on his back. Seeing his friend in trouble, Clifford manages to pull Moody off. Ricky beats Mike, knocks him unconscious, and then turns his attention to Moody. But instead of fighting Clifford's battle for him, he urges Clifford to fight Moody himself while coaching him. Clifford is afraid, but when he finally lands a solid punch and breaks Moody's nose, winning the fight, he finally realizes that Moody the bully is weak and cowardly. Ricky takes his bike back and as the children all leave together, he jokingly asks Clifford to be his bodyguard."] ['On the last day of 8th grade, Julie Corky  has a slumber party. One of the girls she has invited, Staci Blake , declines, saying she is going to the high school dance with her boyfriend Todd . Julie is worried about how she will fit in during high school. She is concerned she will not be popular enough to sit at The Fountain, the cool lunch spot. These worries are increased due to the fact that her best friend Hannah , is moving to Vancouver. At school, Julie, Hannah and their friend Farrah  witness Staci\'s friend Liz  bullying Yancy , a girl their age who is somewhat overweight.

After being dumped by Todd, Staci goes to Julie\'s house and challenges the girls to a scavenger hunt. The winning team gets to sit at The Fountain and the losing team has to sit by the dumpsters.

Liz e-mails the scavenger hunt list to Julie which includes dressing a window mannequin at Old Navy in your own clothes, have a guy from DatesSafe.com buy you a drink at the Cosmo Club, stealing a decal off of a PatrolTech Security car and, to Julie\'s horror, borrowing a pair of boxer shorts from her crush Steve Phillips .

At the house, Ren encourages Julie to "go be a teenager" because "it ends too soon". After arriving at Steve\'s house, the Hypermini needs charging. Hannah says they will find a plug while Julie goes and gets the boxers. Cautiously, Julie enters the house and is seen by Staci and Liz, who only broke into Steve\'s car to get his shorts from an overnight bag. Humorously, Liz calls PatrolTech Security claiming to see a "suspicious person". Inside, Steve is looking through old yearbooks trying to find pictures of Julie, but puts them down to get ready for the dance. Julie hides in the shower as Steve comes into the bathroom, turning the shower on and undressing in front of Julie.

On the way to the store the teens victimize an elderly gentleman in a Green Ascot flatcap calling him names and telling him to "Look in the mirror" flashing a moon out the window. The old man stands up for himself. He is then terrorized by one with a rubber rat and nearly punches the teen in rage. When Judy tries to help him with his fallen bags, he insults her by calling her nasty names.

Judy\'s younger brother Billy later answers the door to Sal, Judy\'s ex-boyfriend, who tells him that she is attending a party at Hull House. Soon after, Jay picks her up along with their friends Max and Frannie. Meanwhile, Angela decides to shoplift at a local convenience store for party food while the salesmen clerks are distracted by Suzanne bending over, revealing her panties. Once outside, Angela reveals the plan is to scare everyone who attends. At the same time, Stooge drives Helen and Roger to the Hull House party. While driving to the party, Stooge\'s car gets a flat. Having a spare tire and no tire iron, they are left stranded on the side of the road. Jay drives up and Max asks if they need a hand. When Stooge says they do, Max only claps and Jay drives off. Once Jay, Judy, Max, and Frannie arrive, they get out to see no one has arrived and Max explains why there is a wall built encircling the entire property. It is rumored to mark an underground stream, where Max explains that Spirits are not supposed to be able to cross running water. They ignore this tale and go inside, where they find a coffin. When they see Angela\'s car lights pull up, Jay has them turn off their lights, hoping to climb into the coffin and scare them. But when he opens the coffin Sal leaps out and scares them instead. A short argument ensues, with Judy taking Sal\'s side, angering Jay, while Angela and Suzanne come in accompanied by Helen, Stooge and Roger. The party soon commences, full with the stolen food from the store and a boom box blaring punk rock music. Angela goes over to Judy, who is trying to light candles, and lights the candle for her. While Angela is lighting the candle, Judy places the lighter on the table and starts to walk away. Angela warns Judy that she should not let the spirits see her "littering up the place". Judy believes that she is just trying to scare her but does put the lighter back in her pocket, obviously afraid, though denies it to Frannie who asks her. All ten teens begin to dance and have a good time. After losing the battery power to the radio, Angela decides to hold a séance as a party game. They all sit in front of a mirror and concentrate on the reflections. The mirror turns black and Helen first sees a demon\'s face and then sees her own dead body hitting the other side of the mirror. A demon is unleashed from inside a furnace located in the crematorium, which first possesses Suzanne. Meanwhile, Roger, whose father is a preacher, does not wish to participate and wants to leave. Angela then reveals to her friends that the house is possessed by a demon, and that the séance could have possibly awoken it. No one believes her but Roger refuses to take the chance and chooses to leave after hearing the news. Helen quickly follows, but neither have a car, so Suzanne gives them Angela\'s car keys, claiming since it is Angela\'s party she is not going to leave. Soon after, Max and Frannie leave with Jay and Judy under the premise of exploring, when all Jay wants is to have sex with Judy. The four depart, leaving Stooge, Suzanne, Sal and Angela alone. Suzanne invites Stooge to the bathroom but before she leaves, she shares a kiss with Angela, passing the demon onto her. Meanwhile, elsewhere in the house, the four departed friends find a room where Max begins to tell the story of Hull House, and the story behind its rumors. Worried that the horrible stories might make Judy more uncomfortable, Jay gets Max and Frannie to depart. But Judy wants no part of sex with Jay in the house. Once in the bathroom, Suzanne goes in and locks the door, leaving Stooge outside. Meanwhile, Roger and Helen continue to look for the gate they drove through that has seemingly disappeared. After a brief argument between the two, Helen vanishes leaving the frightened Roger by himself, just as ghostly voices begin to call out his name. In a state of panic, Roger gives up trying to find the gate yet has no desire to return to the house, so he hides inside Jay\'s car. Inside the house, an argument between Jay and Judy continues over sexual tensions before Jay leaves her in the same room, not realizing that the door locks, keeping Judy trapped inside. Stooge continues to wait for Suzanne outside the bathroom while inside her face ages in the mirror, transforming into a hideously disheveled demon. After hearing what sounds like a mirror breaking, Stooge enters the bathroom only to find no trace of her around, discouraged over this he decides to head back to the main living room. Back in the living room, Sal sits waiting for the others to return and watching Angela, slightly intrigued by how beautiful she has become. After asking her what exactly she was doing, she explains the day of atonement is at hand, then exhibits bizarre behavior. Having never seen Angela exhibit such behavior before, he realizes something is wrong. Suddenly, Angela begins to dance. Angela\'s black dress soon becomes more transparent, as if disappearing. Sal meanwhile becoming more and more sober by the second decides to leave, yet cannot take his eyes off her. Just as he is about to leave, Stooge comes. Sal tries to warn him of her weird behavior but he does not listen and Sal decides to leave. Stooge then begins to take advantage of Angela\'s apparent distraction only to be surprised when she tells him to kiss her; when he does, Stooge begins trying to pull away. After throwing Stooge across the room he gets on his feet, his face covered in blood as Angela chews on it, then spits out his tongue, laughing in the strobe light. Sal finds Suzanne in a room covered in lipstick. He realizes everyone is acting weird and leaves the room. Meanwhile, Max and Frannie find another coffin in a room and decide to have sex inside of it. Suzanne takes off her shirt and after applying more makeup, shoves the lipstick tube inside her left breast, just before Jay walks in and they begin to have sex. Sal returns to the living room to tell Angela he is leaving, only to have her respond by turning around with her hands on fire. Realizing that something is very wrong with the party and its host, Sal tries the door but finds it locked, and after hearing Angela\'s voice become deep and frightening, he leaves the room. Meanwhile, back outside, Roger has fallen asleep in Jays car until he feels a bump. Expecting it to be a prank, he thinks nothing of it until Helen\'s dead body hits the windshield. Terrified, Roger decides to return to the house to warn the others. Suzanne and Jay are having sex when suddenly she begins quizzing him about her makeup. Confused by this, Jay says she looks fine when suddenly Suzanne changes into a demon, and shoves her thumbs into his eyes. Back in the coffin, Max and Frannie are interrupted by a now possessed Stooge who breaks Frannie\'s neck; her body lands on Max, trapping him inside. Stooge then severs Max\'s arm hanging outside the coffin. Back in the house, Roger is looking around when he is confronted by Angela who has now completely transformed. In his escape, he runs into Sal who knows something is wrong and they team together to get out. Stooge appears at the door to the room Judy is locked in. After Stooge leaves the door, Sal and Roger hear Judy yelling and find her, letting her out of the room. Roger then sees Angela approaching and runs away, leaving the other two. Judy sees Angela and becomes momentarily crippled with fear, before Sal gets her into a room. Once inside, the light comes on and the two find Suzanne holding Jay\'s dead body. Suzanne tries to block the two from one another by knocking Sal out the window and deliberately letting Judy run out into the hall. Once out in the hall, all the doors begin to shut and lock leaving her no place to go, except one room. The room she enters is where Max and Frannie lie within the coffin. Max\'s dead arm grabs Judy\'s ankle causing her to scream in terror, causing the bodies to sit up and reach for her. After escaping the room, Judy runs to the only door unlocked, which leads to the balcony atop the mansion. Sal comes to outside in what he discovers is an air lift, which he climbs up. Knowing Stooge is approaching the area, Judy quietly approaches the edge of the house, where she sees Roger on the ground. He warns her as Angela appears and attempts to throw her off the roof. Sal, who had reached the top already, intervenes, causing Judy to lose her footing and be left dangling from a gutter. In the ensuing fight between Sal and Angela, they both fall off the roof, with Sal landing on a spike. Judy ends up falling, landing atop of Roger but spraining her ankle. After being confronted by Stooge and Angela again, they run back into the house, ending up in the basement, specifically, the crematorium. Stooge and Angela begin pounding on the door. Once they get inside, Judy and Roger have formed a makeshift flame thrower from a gas pipe in the cremator and douse the two with fire. The two flee the scene and once again try the doors, only to find them still locked. At the living room door, Roger leaves Judy alone after he sees Jay, which, accompanied soon by a burnt Angela, corners the two in the room, soon joined by Sal and Max. Roger, seeing the only way out as jumping through the window does so, and Judy quickly follows. The two realize their only means to escape is by climbing over the brick wall surrounding the property, albeit riddled by barbed wire. Roger climbs quickly to the top, leaving Judy alone to deal with the demons who are approaching her. After swatting at her clothes and burning the skin on her leg, Roger appears again trying to help pull Judy over. Right as she manages to reach the top of the wall the demons begin to die from the rising sun. On the other side they watch the actual demon leave the bodies and roar mightily at them before vanishing into thin air. The two walk slowly home, battered and bruised, and pass near the home of an old man. Inside his house, the man sits down to eat one of his wife\'s home-made apple pies, which she made with the apples into which he had stuck razor blades. The razor blades begin cutting through his throat as they kill him.

The next year\'s group of seniors are preparing for the annual hazing of incoming freshmen. Randall "Pink" Floyd, the school\'s star football player, is asked to sign a pledge promising not to take drugs during the summer or do anything that would "jeopardize the goal of a championship season". When classes end, the incoming freshman boys are hunted down by the seniors and paddled. The incoming freshman girls are also hazed; they are rounded up in the school parking lot by senior girls, covered in mustard, ketchup, flour and raw eggs, and forced to propose to senior boys. Freshman Mitch Kramer escapes the hazing with his best friend Carl Burnett when Carl\'s mom pulls a shotgun on flunking-thus-repeating senior Fred O\'Bannion, but he is later cornered at his baseball game, and violently paddled. O\'Bannion, a senior participating in the hazing tradition for a second year after failing to graduate, delights in punishing Mitch.

When the teacher, Ms. Vicki Norris , notices him wearing a hat, he is forced to take it off, thus revealing that he is bald. Instantly he is ostracized by the other students, including Evelyn.

She meets a boy named Patrick  and they quickly start dating, which leads Patrick assuming that Harold is Shelley's father.

Harold returns home, angry and upset, and decides to go back to his old home, where everyone liked him. He leaves late at night so that his Mom and sister won't get suspicious. He only makes it as far as a strip bar. Harold thinks that because he looks older, he may pass for legal age, but Cromer is there as well, and he takes Harold home. He gives Harold words of encouragement, and then drops him off at home. The next day in gym class, Harold is asked to take his shirt off as part of the Skins and Shirts team. He has a big strip of hair on his back, and everyone starts laughing at him. He talks to Cromer, and they decide to pull a prank on the coach, turning off the hot water when the coach is in the shower.  Not wanting to go back to school, Harold buys a few beers for himself, and is followed by Maude, who still thinks that he is much older. When he tells her he is 14, she thinks that means the size of his manhood. When he explains he is only 14 years old, she tells him to come back in a few years. Patrick and his buddies ask Harold for one more favor: to get them some beer for a party. Harold buys the beer, but is arrested by police, who believe him to be an adult selling beer to minors. They do not believe him when he tells them that he is only fourteen. He is taken to jail and is bailed out by Cromer. Later that night, Patrick apologizes for what happened, and tells Harold he wants to have sex with Harold's sister. Shelley tells Harold she doesn't really want to have sex, although she likes Patrick. They get Cromer to wait outside the hotel room, When Shelley leaves the room, Maude is sent in her place, and Patrick ends up having sex with her. There is a go cart race coming up, and some of the bullies put a dent in Harold's cart in order to slow him down, but Cromer repairs the dent.

After meeting his new journalism teacher, Mr. Walker, Owen and Tom meet everyone for lunch. They discuss the police finding a girl\'s body, Becky, after it was dragged through the woods by a wolf. The group considers who could have murdered Becky, when Dodger proposes expanding Cry Wolf to the entire school. Owen suggests creating a fake e-mail telling everyone about a serial killer who goes from campus to campus killing students. They describe the killer as wearing an orange ski mask, a camouflage jacket and brandishing a hunting knife. That night, they send out the e-mail.

Suddenly Mr. Walker enters the room. After noticing that Mr. Walker has a jacket, an orange mask and a knife, Owen shoots him. The door is suddenly opened by Dodger, Tom and Regina. Owen is arrested for murder. The group admits that it was a prank to get Mercedes and Owen back for making them stay on campus. It is discovered that Mr. Walker was involved with Becky, the gun in his desk being the same one that killed her. Dodger visits Owen, and says that she would never have played the game if she knew that Mr. Walker was cheating on her, revealing she had organised everything.

While rummaging through the Walshes\' attic, they find an old newspaper clipping, a Spanish map, and an artifact relating to a rumor of a lost but not forgotten pirate treasure somewhere in the area. Hearing the call of adventure, Mikey tries to persuade his friends to join him in search for the treasure hoarded by a pirate named One-Eyed Willie. Initially reluctant, the group eventually decides to evade the authority of Mikey\'s older brother, Brandon, and escape for one last "Goonie adventure." They then head down the coast and stumble upon a derelict seaside restaurant that seems to match coordinates set by the map and an old doubloon, unaware that the Fratellis, a family of fugitives, are using the restaurant as their hideout. After first encountering the family, the Goonies come back after the Fratellis have left and discover their criminal intents, and send Chunk, the group\'s clumsy, heavy-set dreamer and teller of tall tales, to get help.

After her mother is accidentally killed by falling down to the floor and upon knocking her father out, Molly turns to Joseph for help discovering that he is one of them and has set her up by taking her to his house. Dr. Emerson  arrives at Joseph\'s house and tells Molly that she is also to be a servant of the devil. She says Molly can either kill her father to break the pact, or submit to the devil.

This attempt is in vain because the clock has already struck midnight. The movie switches to a mental institution, where a doctor is talking to a woman dressed in black, later revealed to be a cold-hearted Molly.

Molly becomes valedictorian of her high school, and dates Joseph. She is seen leaving her high school graduation with Joseph in a limousine, after being told by Dr. Emerson  that they\'ll "see her soon."'] ['Shaun Brumder  is a teenager from affluent Orange County, California. Although bright and intelligent, he has very little interest in education or studying, instead trying to lead a carefree SoCal lifestyle of surfing, drinking and partying. A turning point comes when Shaun\'s best friend Lonny  is killed in a surfing accident, causing Shaun to rethink his own life. One day, he finds a novel on the beach by the author Marcus Skinner, which quickly inspires him to become a writer. Upon learning that Skinner is an English professor at Stanford University, Shaun makes it his goal to attend Stanford and study under him, seeing it as an opportunity to escape from his superficial life in Orange County. Shaun dramatically improves himself academically, obtaining high grades and SAT scores as well as becoming the president of his graduating class. Following the advice of his guidance counselor, Ms. Cobb , who tells him that he is a "shoo-in" for acceptance, Shaun applies only to Stanford. This severely backfires as Shaun later finds out that he is rejected from Stanford, ironically because Ms. Cobb mixed up his academic transcript with that of a much less intelligent student. In an attempt to help him, Shaun\'s animal rights activist girlfriend Ashley  successfully convinces her friend Tanya  to allow Shaun to be interviewed at his home by Tanya\'s grandfather, a Stanford board member, so Shaun can explain his situation. Unfortunately, the antics displayed during the interview by his dysfunctional family members, including his alcoholic, emotionally fragile mother Cindy  and his dim-witted stoner brother Lance , cause Shaun\'s interviewers to storm out in anger and disgust. Shaun then reaches out to his wealthy father Bud , who had left his wife and family to marry a much younger woman , pleading him to donate money to Stanford in order to increase his chances of being accepted. Bud, however, disapproves of Shaun\'s dream of being a writer and refuses. In a last-ditch effort to get him accepted, Ashley and Lance convince Shaun to drive to Palo Alto and plead his case directly to Stanford Admissions Director Don Durkett . By the time the trio arrive on campus, it is nighttime and the admissions building is already closed. While Lance distracts  the secretary on duty in the office, Shaun and Ashley steal the address to Durkett\'s house. They arrive at his home, where Shaun shows him his real high school transcript. Although impressed with Shaun\'s credentials, Durkett is reluctant to admit him, as it is already very late in the admissions process. After much groveling, Shaun finally convinces Durkett to go back to his office in the Admissions Building and give it a second thought. Disaster strikes again, however, when Ashley drugs Durkett by accident with Lance\'s ecstasy, causing Durkett to become high. Things go from bad to worse when Shaun and Ashley arrive at the Admissions Building and find it engulfed in flames . They abandon the hallucinating Durkett and flee the scene to avoid being arrested. Ashley finally becomes frustrated with Shaun\'s obsession of only getting into Stanford, and points out that his attending would mean they would be separated, thus ending their relationship. She then angrily leaves Shaun on his own. Depressed, Shaun wanders the campus and meets a female student who invites him to a frat party. There, he witnesses the behavior of the Stanford coeds and is disappointed to learn that they are just as vapid and ditzy as the girls he knew from Orange County. After leaving the party with a more cynical view of college, Shaun, by chance, runs into Professor Skinner  and is invited to his office to chat. Skinner is amused with Shaun\'s belief that he must study and work in a highly intelligent environment in order to become successful, pointing out that many famous authors such as James Joyce and William Faulkner grew up in places that were not intellectually stimulating, but still became great writers. Having an epiphany, Shaun realizes his previous misguided intentions and seeks out Ashley to apologize to her. After catching up with her, the two also pick up Lance  and drive home. Back in Orange County, Shaun\'s parents seek out each other to determine how to deal with Shaun\'s problem. They end up reconciling, realizing that they are much happier together than with their respective new spouses. They also conclude that they have not been very good parents to Shaun and, in an attempt to make amends, Bud donates enough money to Stanford for the construction of a brand new Admissions Building . This action gets Shaun accepted into Stanford. Although Shaun is initially ecstatic, he then remembers the things that both Ashley and Professor Skinner had told him. Shaun finally decides to stay in Orange County with Ashley and his family because he loves them too much to leave them, and he is now able to view living in Orange County as a positive influence for his writing career, rather than a detriment. The film ends with Shaun going surfing with his friends again for the first time since Lonny\'s death.'] ["Barney is a student/science lab nerd who obtains telekinetic powers after a lab accident.

After the two decide to skip out on school to go on a special surfing expedition with friends for their birthday, the twins are expelled from their high school for truancy. Their father Elton Deedle  has become tired of their insolence and lazy lifestyle and thus decides to ship them to a boot camp to straighten them out. The boys are horrified that they’re going to have to fly state-side in order for this to happen, as the camp is located in Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming. The boys arrive in Wyoming ill prepared for the far-cooler weather, disembarking from their plane dressed in shorts, flip-flops and hula shirts. They attract the attention of a small crowd when they summon a remote controlled crate containing a mini-bar that they use to create hula drinks. Afterwards they leave the terminal, noticing a gruff looking mountain man whom they make fun of, to their shock the man reveals a sign with their last names written on it, indicating he’s their ride. Major Flowers  is already disgusted with their behavior, on the drive back to Yellowstone from the airport, Flowers reveals that his once successful camp was shut down by the children’s parents and their lawyers but the camp wasn’t necessary anymore because he intended for the Deedles to undergo survival training. Flowers becomes distracted in describing his plan and fails to pay attention to the road, eventually driving over the edge of a hillside and crashing into a river. Thinking he had killed the Deedles, he runs off thinking he’ll hide from the authorities. The Deedles awaken from their crash and find some women’s clothing that had caught onto Flower’s truck before it crashed, since it was their only option for dry clothes they opted to wear them. After, they begin to hike towards the parks main entrance, they find some of their gear and decide to land-luge down a long hill with their hula crate remotely in tow. They bypass a long line of traffic awaiting entry into Yellowstone but unable to slow down or gain enough control of their boards they crash into the park’s sign and are then collided into by the hula machine—cracking their helmets off. When the Park Rangers arrived, the only identity the boys had on them were the names “Mel” written on Phil’s sweatshirt tag and “Mo” written on Stew’s. After the incident the boys are carted off to the Ranger medical center and nursed back to health and decide to assume the false identities as it appears to be a one-way ticket to success and approval of their father. The boys find it difficult to live in their new identities, as the park rangers have already learned that the “real” Mel and Mo are vegetarians, thus the boys are forced to become such as well in order to maintain their cover. Because of their dimwitted surfer nature, the boys do not click well with the commanding park ranger, Captain Pine, although Phil falls for his stepdaughter Lt. Jesse Ryan whom the Captain is very protective of. This leads to a series of accidents all of which the Deedles are to blame for and land them in disfavor with Captain Pine. Through their trials, the Deedles inadvertently discover that an ex-park ranger named Slater  feels he’s been betrayed by the park, the Rangers and mainly Captain Pine and so he has created a secret bunker underground near Old Faithful and has devised a plan to divert Old Faithful’s waterflow into a new geyser he’s created on his own land which he is christened “New Faithful”. Unable to win any support for investigation from their fellow rangers, the Deedles take matters into their own hands and attempt to thwart Slater’s plan. However, the real Mel and Mo arrive at the Ranger’s base at a very untimely moment to reveal that Phil and Stew are not who they say they are. Pine, Jesse and the other rangers are disgusted with their dishonesty and banish them from Yellowstone. As the Deedles are walking down the highway attempting to hitch-hike, the big picture dawns on Phil and they devise a plan to get back into Yellowstone in order to stop Slater once-and-for-all. They rig a grappling hook into a grate in the roadway, and as an unsuspecting car passes it would catch the undercarriage and tow the Deedles , essentially a land version of parasailing. From a few hundred feet up in the air, they both notice a familiar stench and discover the person towing them is none other than Major Flowers—who becomes distracted by his stowaways and subsequently drives over a cliff  landing himself in a river. The boys parachute to the entrance for Slaters underground tunnel network and go underground, where they locate and subdue Slater’s two cronies Mr. Crabbe  and Mr. Nemo . They devise a plan to re-divert the water from New Faithful back to Old Faithful, and to escape by donning heat-resistance suits and escaping through the plumbing and through Old Faithful’s spout. The plan succeeds, Slater is exposed and the Deedles become heroes for saving Old Faithful. In a fortunate turn of events, the force of the explosion of water was so great it created a small lake which naturally created waves large enough to surf on, and the boys were able to create a park out of it. Earning the respect of their father for their success, from Captain Pine for their help in saving Yellowstone, and for Phil the love of Jesse.'] ['Seth  and Evan  are two high school seniors who lament their virginity and poor social standing. Best friends since childhood, the two are about to go off to different colleges, as Seth did not get accepted into Dartmouth. After Seth is paired with Jules  during Home-Ec class, she invites him to a party at her house later that night. Later, Fogell  comes up to the two and reveals his plans to obtain a fake ID during lunch. Seth uses this to his advantage and promises to bring alcohol to Jules\' party. Fogell\'s fake ID is met with disgust by Seth and Evan, as it states that Fogell\'s name is simply "McLovin". After contemplating the options, Seth decides they have no choice but to have Fogell buy the alcohol with his fake ID. Fogell goes in and successfully buys the alcohol, but is interrupted when a robber enters the store, punches him in the face, and takes money from the cash register. When police officers Slater  and Michaels  arrive to investigate the robbery, Seth and Evan  believe that Fogell has been busted for the fake ID. Inside the store, Slater and Michaels are apparently fooled by Fogell\'s ID and give him a ride to the party. While arguing over what to do, Seth is hit by a car being driven by Francis , who promises to take them to a party he is attending in exchange for them not telling the police. During Fogell\'s time with the police, they exhibit very irresponsible behavior such as drinking, shooting their firearms at a stop sign, and improper use of their sirens to run red lights. All the while, the three develop a strong friendship. When Seth and Evan arrive at the party, they quickly discover that Francis is not welcome there. Francis is brutally beaten by Mark , the party host, while Seth fills detergent bottles from the basement with alcohol he finds in the fridge. After running away from the party, which soon devolves into a fistfight, Evan angrily asserts that Seth has been holding him back from all these years and preventing him from becoming socially active. In the midst of this argument, Seth is hit by the police cruiser when Michaels distracts Slater while he is driving. Afraid of losing their jobs, the cops decide to frame the accident on Seth and Evan and begin to arrest them. While being arrested, Seth and Evan see Fogell coming out of the car and decide to run for it, Fogell and the alcohol in tow. Arriving at the party, Seth successfully delivers the alcohol while Evan meets up with his crush Becca . Becca is already drunk and initiates sex with Evan, but ultimately ends up throwing up on Jules\' bed before anything can happen. Fogell impresses Nicola ([[Aviva  with his fake ID and goes upstairs to have sex with her. Seth tries to get with Jules, but learns that she does not want to do anything with him while he is drunk. In the midst of the conversation, Seth passes out, headbutting Jules in the eye. Slater and Michaels arrive to break up the party, prompting Seth to carry Evan out of the party to save him. Slater goes upstairs to find Fogell having sex with Nicola, scaring away the latter. The two officers sit down with Fogell and reveal that they knew his ID was fake and merely wanted to show him that cops can have a good time. As repayment, the officers pretend to arrest Fogell to boost his popularity. Removing the last piece of evidence of their wildly irresponsible night, the three torch the police cruiser with molotov cocktails while Fogell signs an affidavit saying that the car was stolen by a drug addict. Seth and Evan go to Evan\'s house, where the two reconcile and declare their brotherly love for one another. Going to the mall the next day, they meet Jules and Becca, who are shopping for cover-up and new comforters respectively. After an awkward exchange, Seth goes to help Jules while Evan helps Becca and the two best friends part ways.'] ['{{plot}} Mark Thackeray  is beginning his teaching position at the North Quay Secondary School in the tough East End of London. He comes from British Guiana via California, and holds a degree in Communication Engineering. He has applied unsuccessfully for engineering positions throughout England, and is taking this job to make ends meet while continuing to look for a job in his field. The staff of North Quay offer varying opinions about students at the school. Mr. Weston  is openly contemptuous of them. Newly hired teacher Gillian Blanchard  is admittedly afraid of them. Deputy Head Evans  and Clinty Clintridge  warn that while they are mostly good kids, they come from rough homes, and excel at riding roughshod over teachers. Headmaster Florian  explains that they have been principally rejected from other schools. The audience is informed that their antics drove their last teacher to resign. The students more than live up to their reputation. Led by Bert Denham ([[Christian Roberts  and Pamela Dare , the pupils are an unruly mob who view the classroom as their domain, not Thackeray\'s. An expected battle of wills ensues. As the students\' antics progress from simple disruptive behaviour to distasteful pranks, Thackeray retains his calm manner and resists being baited. A turning point comes, however, when one morning he discovers something, presumably a sanitary pad, burning in the classroom grate. He angrily orders the boys out of the classroom and excoriates the girls for their disgusting, "sluttish" behaviour. Dismayed by his lack of self-restraint, he retreats to the staff room, upset that he let himself be manipulated by "kids." Returning to the classroom, Thackeray outlines a new approach to teaching his students and sets strict ground rules. The students will be leaving school and entering the adult world soon. His new strategy is to treat them as adults and allow them to discuss issues of their own choosing for the remainder of the term. He emphasises this by throwing out all the textbooks. As part of being adults, he insists the students will use proper forms of address  and to take pride in their appearance and deportment. Denham continues to bait Thackeray, but the rest of the class is won over. Although Thackeray\'s humble background is quite like their own, he\'s made a success of himself by cultivating his language and dress. He insists they can do the same if they wish. Unexposed to the rich history and culture of their own city, the students are especially excited when he suggests they go on a class outing to the museum. The Headmaster is reluctant but obtains approval for the outing, and Thackeray arrives on the morning of the trip to find a classroom of well-dressed, well-scrubbed students. The outing is depicted in a photo montage of the students enjoying themselves among the sculptures and art. There is a darker turn when the gym teacher, Mr. Bell , insists that \'Fats\' Buckley  participate in vaulting, despite his classmates\' objections. The vault collapses and breaks under Buckley\'s weight. Although Buckley is not seriously hurt, the boys are angry at the coach for forcing him to attempt the jump. Picking up the vault\'s broken leg, Potter  threatens Bell with it. Thackeray is called to defuse the situation. In class, he demands that Potter apologise directly to Bell for the incident even if he believes Bell was wrong. At this point Thackeray has lost the support of much of the class, especially the boys. They refuse to invite him to the class dance, and when Seales\'  mother dies, the class takes up a collection for a wreath but refuses to accept Thackeray\'s donation. At this point, the Headmaster advises him that he feels \'the adult approach\' has failed, that future class outings are cancelled, and that Thackeray will take over the boys\' gym classes. Pamela\'s mother comes to speak with Thackeray, concerned that Pamela is staying out late and might be getting into trouble. Thackeray agrees to speaks with Pamela, who insists her mother does not care about her and that the presence of male callers at her mother\'s house excuses her actions. Thackeray maintains that Pamela still owes her mother respect and, disillusioned, she angrily accuses him of being \'just one of them\'. She also refuses to take the flowers to Seales\' mother\'s funeral. Thackeray\'s split with the class is complete. Thackeray\'s search for an engineering position has continued throughout the movie, and at this low point in his relationship with his students, he is ecstatic to receive a job offer in the mail. In gym, Denham insists they have a boxing class, beginning with him and Thackeray. Thackeray reluctantly agrees. Despite getting in some early blows, Denham is disabled when Thackeray throws a punch that knocks the wind out of him. Thackeray draws back his fist to hit Denham again but gains control of his emotions and declares the fight over. Afterward, Denham waits to speak with Thackeray in the stairwell. Although Denham admits he was trying to hurt Thackeray in order to convince him to resign from teaching, Denham is surprised that Thackeray did not capitalise on his advantage. For his part, Thackeray admits that he lost his temper but that he understands the apparent unfairness of some of his decisions. Thackeray then offers to recommend Denham for a position as a boxing instructor to the younger students next term. Surprised that he would be regarded as a potential teacher, Denham nevertheless promises to consider it. Denham is clearly impressed, and expresses his admiration for Thackeray to his fellow students. By winning Denham over, Thackeray wins back the respect of the rest of the class, and he is invited to the class dance. When he shows up at the Seales funeral, he is greeted by the entire class, who have come to pay their respects. At the dance, all has clearly worked out well. Weston admits that Thackeray is really quite a gifted teacher and should reconsider leaving. The Deputy Head concurs, suggesting that he should go to another school, if nothing else. Barbara Pegg ([[Lulu  announces a "ladies\' choice" dance and Pamela singles out Thackeray as her partner. Denham announces that the class has \'something special\' for Thackeray and Miss Wong presents him with a pewter mug while Lulu sings the movie theme. Thackeray is too moved for words and retires to his classroom. Breaking Thackeray\'s solitude in the dark silence of his classroom, a young boy and girl rush into the classroom not immediately realising the teacher\'s presence. Upon seeing him they begin mocking his gift and joking that they will be in his class next year. When they leave, Thackeray rises, ponders his situation, then retrieves the job offer from his pocket and rips it into pieces.'] ["Devon Thompson  and Gabby Davis  are the ultimate fans of the band 5 Leo Rise .

A new family, the Walshes, have moved into the former home of Nancy Thompson. The son, Jesse, happens to move into Nancy's old room. He eventually begins to have nightmares of Krueger demanding that Jesse kill for him using Jesse as a host body to come back to life in the real world. Jesse's girlfriend, Lisa, finds Nancy's old diary in Jesse's closet in which she had been keeping track of her nightmares and her encounters with Freddy. Reading the diary strikes a chord with Jesse as he is experiencing similar nightmares himself. He goes to his parents in a panic, but they argue and Jesse storms out. Jesse later finds himself walking the streets late at night and walks into a bar where he runs into his gym coach. His coach takes him back to the gym to run laps as detention. The coach has Jesse hit the showers while he goes back to his office. While he is in his office, the shelves begin to come alive, hurling balls and other sports equipment at him. Two ropes grab him by the wrists and drag him into the shower that begins to fill with steam. Freddy appears among the steam and slashes the coach's back, killing him. As the steam clears, Jesse is the one with the glove on his hand, Jesse screams and the scene passes onto Jesse's house. Lisa begins to do some digging and uncovers information about Krueger, including the location of the abandoned power plant where he used to work, and where he brought his victims. Meanwhile, Freddy visits Jesse's younger sister, Angela, but when she wakes up, it's actually Jesse standing there with the glove on his hand.

This appears to have no real bearing on the rest of the film. Cassie and Sean, as well as ex-boyfriend Matt and good friend Annabel, decide to go for one last bash before they start at university. The four go to a club situated in an old church, where instead of one's hand being stamped, it is branded. While at the club, Cassie sees two strange figures: a man with a clear, plastic mask  and an imposing man with a scarred face . Deathmask tries to grab her on the dance floor, and she pushes him away and steps outside the club with Sean. In the parking lot, Matt eavesdrops on their conversation. Sean confesses his love for Cassie, who claims she feels the same way, but seems unable to say the words 'I love you' in return. Sean returns to the club to find Annabel, and Matt convinces Cassie to give him a last 'goodbye' kiss. Sean sees this, and reacts badly to it, giving Cassie the silent treatment as they drive away. While he ignores her attempts to explain, Cassie, who is behind the wheel, continually looks away from the road. Eventually, the car crashes, and Cassie's next memory is of being rushed to the hospital. Matt and Annabel are unharmed, but Sean has been killed on impact. During the school term that follows, Cassie has several visions of Sean, as though he isn't really dead. Matt is constantly in her company, and sometimes she mistakes him for Sean. Cassie also has numerous visions of Deathmask and Hideous Dancer, even to the point of seeing Matt and Annabel in their company. On several occasions, she believes she is being chased by the two men, although Annabel and Matt assure her that the incidents are all in her mind. While Deathmask chases her through the campus, Cassie faints, and is rescued by Father Jude, a young priest . Father Jude is sympathetic to her fears, and offers to listen if she ever needs someone to talk to. In an effort to cheer her up, Matt signs Cassie up for a swimming competition. Annabel is constantly trying to get Cassie to leave her dorm room -- specifically, to go dancing at the club. In an aborted effort to drag her along, Annabel introduces Cassie to an androgynous creature named Raven, who seems to have some kind of precognitive powers. Raven claims that Cassie is in the 'wrong place', and that she belongs 'with Sean'. A few nights later, after being chased again, Cassie knocks at the church door, and Father Jude gives her sanctuary. He gives her an amulet depicting St Jude, and encourages her to stay strong, then allows her to sleep in his small room in the church. Upon awakening that morning, Cassie sees that the calendar in the room reads 1981. She enters the office of the attending priest and asks to speak to Father Jude. The attending priest says that Father Jude died in 1981. After the swim competition, which Cassie wins, she is chased through the women's locker room and university pool by Deathmask. Defending herself with the tube of a florescent lamp, she ends up stabbing him in the stomach with it. They fall into the pool, and Cassie flees. She runs into Matt, who claims that there is no one in the pool; indeed, when the two return to the pool, there is no body in the water. Even though she believes that Matt and Annabel are conspiring against her with Deathmask and Hideous Dancer, Cassie requests that Matt take her home to her mother. Matt instead drives Cassie to the club, saying that he wishes to pick up Annabel. Cassie follows him into the club, but gets lost, eventually finding Annabel and Raven in a bathroom. When Raven tells her to leave -- or die -- Cassie makes her way back to the parking lot. In the car with Matt, he drunkenly insists on another 'goodbye forever' kiss. Cassie hits him with a bottle and pushes him out of the car, then drives away. In a scene much like the original car accident, Cassie wrecks the car. She again comes to in the hospital. On a gurney next to her is Raven, who speaks a few words of comfort before dying. Cassie also appears to die, and a priest arrives to perform the Last Rites. Father Jude arrives and takes Cassie's hand, asking if she would be willing to die in order to save Sean's life. Cassie says she would. He then asks her if she would be willing to live for him. Cassie says that she doesn't want to die. After a nightmarish dream, in which Deathmask and Hideous Dancer strangle her with her St Jude medallion, Cassie awakens. The entire film has been a sort of coma-dream: in the original accident, Cassie and Sean survived, while Matt and Annabel were killed. The occupants of the other car -- Raven, Deathmask, and Hideous Dancer -- were also fatally injured. Cassie spent the course of the film in a half-dead, half-living state, wherein those who were killed in the accident attempted to keep her with them. Father Jude, and Cassie's visions of Sean, were what brought her back to life."] ['{{plot}} Empire Records is a small, independent record shop managed by Joe . The store is set in an unnamed city in Delaware, and like the employees, is eclectic and unique. The staff is very much a self-created family, with Joe as the reluctant and perpetually exasperated but loveable father figure. Joe selects Lucas  to close the store for the first time ever. While counting the day\'s receipts, Lucas discovers that Empire Records is about to be converted into a branch of Music Town, a franchise music store. In an attempt to save the store, Lucas takes the day\'s cash receipts to Atlantic City. While initially very lucky, he loses the entire amount. Joe is distracted from dealing with this immediate crisis due to a scheduled publicity stunt. Rex Manning , a pompous, fading pop singer, is due to arrive to sign autographs and promote his new album. No one is really looking forward to "Rex Manning Day" except cashier Corey , an overachieving student headed for Harvard University who has a schoolgirl crush on Rex, and plans to lose her virginity to him. Corey\'s best friend and fellow cashier Gina , a more adventurous and free spirit than Corey, encourages Corey in her pursuit of the much older Manning. Empire\'s owner, Mitchell Beck , arrives to collect the missing deposit, but Joe covers for Lucas and plays for time by handing Mitchell a bag full of loose receipts. AJ  confides in Joe that he loves Corey, and has chosen Rex Manning Day as the day he tells her. Lucas returns and rather than show repentance or guilt, calmly and repeatedly insists that everything will somehow work out, much to Joe\'s growing confusion and frustration. Joe forbids Lucas to leave the store  until he is able to repay the $9,000. Deb , another store employee, arrives. She, as usual, is hostile and antisocial to the rest of the staff. She immediately locks herself in the bathroom, where she impulsively shaves her head. As she exits the bathroom, AJ sees that her wrists are bandaged and she admits that she attempted suicide. It is revealed that Deb and Berko , a local rock musician and another store employee with whom Deb is romantically involved, have recently had a fight, but Deb insists that he was not the reason for her suicide attempt. A young shoplifter who identifies himself only as Warren Beatty  is apprehended outside the store by Lucas. Soon after, Rex Manning arrives with his assistant Jane . Manning is condescending toward Joe, the rest of the staff, and his fans. Corey demands to bring Rex his lunch and awkwardly attempts to seduce him during his lunch break. When Manning responds with a crude pass, Corey runs off in embarrassment. A lovesick AJ finally attempts to tell Corey how he feels about her. Corey, emotionally overwhelmed by her encounter with her idol, tells AJ that she cannot handle his admission. Crushed, AJ abandons his plan. In the meanwhile, both Joe and Berko attempt to reach out to Deb, who refuses to explain her behavior or the circumstances that led to her bandaged wrists. Deb buries herself in work, but is clearly upset. As the afternoon progresses, the plan to convert Empire Records into a Music Town is revealed, and Joe admits that he had hoped to buy Mitchell out. However, Joe will now have to use his money to replace what Lucas lost, and Empire Records is now doomed to become a Music Town. The afternoon continues to spiral downward. Corey accuses Gina of encouraging her ill-advised behavior around Rex. Outraged at the accusation and seeking to hurt Corey, Gina seduces Rex Manning, much to the horror of her friends. When Corey confronts her, calling her a slut, Gina retaliates by revealing Corey\'s secret amphetamine habit, which helps her stay up all night studying. Corey has a hysterical episode and has to be physically restrained by Joe. Uncharacteristically, Deb shows sympathy towards the always perfect Corey having a near meltdown and helps calm her. Corey, after hearing about Deb\'s suicide attempt, arranges a "funeral" for her where all her friends gather around and say things that they love about her. Lucas reveals that Joe actually rescued him from the orphanage as a teen, and was trying to repay him for his kindness. Deb admits she tried  to kill herself. During the mock funeral, "Warren" returns with a gun and holds up the store. Deb boldly confronts Warren, confusing him and distracting him from his plan, and the rest of the staff persuade Warren into admitting that he only returned because he felt kinship with the rest of the misfits in the store, leading Joe to offer him a job. After the police leave, Lucas admits defeat, and suggests calling Mitchell. However, his friends and coworkers , pool their resources to replace the missing money. Despite their best efforts, they are thousands short. Suddenly inspired, Mark runs out of the store and impulsively jumps in front of a news crew covering the hold up and announces a late night benefit party/concert to save Empire. Between AJ\'s art, various money raising efforts by the rest of the staff, a rooftop concert featuring Berko and Gina, enough is made to replace the money Lucas lost. Joe and Lucas return the money to Mitchell, and promptly quit. Mitchell, appalled at the debacle and the prospect of managing the store without Joe, offers to sell it to him. Joe agrees. Corey tells AJ that she really does love him, too, but that she now hates him for doubting his ability to succeed in art school. AJ tells her he has quit the store, and has been accepted to an art school in Boston, and they finally kiss.'] ['A semi-documentary concerning the violent lives of delinquent teenagers in Seoul.Synopsis from {{cite web}}'] ["The film centers on Alice Cantwell and Maxine Carter.

Strange things have been going on in the quiet little town of Middleberg: Dogs on people's roofs, alarm clocks going off three hours early, eggs all over a teacher's car, sweet gelatin in the swimming pool, and B's spray-painted all over town, including the lockers of the school—except for Frances' locker, which has a B inside it. All these weird pranks seem to point to Frances, but none of it makes sense to her. The only person who can help her in this situation is a guy only she can see; Larry Houdini . Larry tells Frances that she's being framed by the Boogeyman, and he seems to know what's going on better than she does. Frances has a difficult time believing what Larry tells her, because she's always tried to look at the world like an adult, using logic and facts to explain everything, after her little brother, Darwin, almost died from a serious illness a few years ago. Over time, the Boogeyman's pranks become more insidious and incriminating which further ruins Frances' life. Frances ends up losing her friend Joanne, making an idiot of herself when she tries to convince others of Larry's existence and having her family questioning her sanity. The two of them decide to put their heads together to get rid of the Boogeyman. Then she learns that Larry was Darwin's imaginary friend. But, Frances convinced Darwin in the past that Larry was not real, so Larry starts to turn into a boogeyman himself which is the fate of all imaginary friends who get cut loose prematurely. Finally, the Boogeyman performs such a crazy prank that the entire town is demanding answers from Frances and her family and turned Frances into an outcast in front of the town and her family. Then Darwin gets kidnapped by the Boogeyman, who hopes to kill him, and Larry and Frances must travel into the mysterious Boogeyworld under the bed to save him and restore her reputation. For a few minutes, Larry turns into a complete Boogeyman and the real boogyman almost kills Darwin by throwing him over a cliff as Larry held Frances captive with a net. But Frances convinces Darwin that Larry is real and Larry reverts back to his normal self. After using a special machine on the original boogeyman, Frances realizes that it's her old imaginary friend, Zoe. Frances had turned her back on Zoe when Darwin became sick and she had decided that imaginary friends and flights of fancy were useless while family and reality was important, which she thought were the only things to save him. She apologizes to the boogeyman and Zoe returns to her old imaginary self. They all return to the real world and Larry and Zoe have to leave. Frances, whose name was cleared and her life back in order, has become too old and they have to go to new children. Frances is distraught as it was not easy for her to believe in them again so, before Larry and Zoe leave, Larry kisses Frances as a way of showing her that childhood was great but, then, so is adulthood if she keeps a sense of wonder. But they still visit when Frances is sleeping."] ["Anna is an ambitious young archaeologist who desperately needs the kudos of an important find, but her work is ruined when the authorities suddenly shut down the old hospital in which she is working.
