[' The story starts as one of the robots flies into a scientist\'s secret lair and unloads a pile of cash into a vault. The robot is controlled completely from the scientists command center, and we see that he is one of many robots similar to him, lined up along the walls of the lair. Next, we see the front page of the Daily Planet, reporting the "mechanical monsters" robbery right alongside an announcement for the display of 50&nbsp;million dollars of the world\'s rarest gems at the local museum.  Later, as Lois and Clark are covering the museum\'s exhibit for the Planet, a robot lands in the street outside. The police pelt it with machine gun fire as it marches towards the museum, but the bullets bounce harmlessly off. Museum visitors, including Clark and Lois, flee as the monster marches towards the jewels and begins loading them into an opening in its back. While Clark phones the Planet from the nearest phone booth, Lois climbs into the monster\'s back, just as the monster leaves the museum and takes off into the sky. Clark emerges from the booth, notices Lois gone, and says, "This is a job for Superman!" He goes back into the phone booth and changes his clothes, emerging in his classic red-and-blue costume. Flying high above the city, Superman spots the robot and uses his X-ray vision to see Lois inside with the jewels.  He lands on it and struggles to open the door in its back, only to have the scientist maneuver the robot upside down and throw him off into a power line, tangling him in the wires. As the robot is upside down, the door flies open and all the jewels fall out, with Lois surviving only by hanging for dear life until the robot flips back over. As Superman struggles to free himself from the wires, the robot arrives at the lair, but instead of jewels, the scientist finds Lois in its payload. Infuriated, he demands that she tell him where the jewels are. The next time we see her, she is bound and gagged on a platform held over a pot of boiling metal in part of what appears to be an industrial foundry. The scientist pulls a lever which starts some machinery gradually lowering her closer and closer to the liquid. Meanwhile, Superman frees himself from the power lines and knocks down the door to the scientist\'s lair, only to meet the army of robots . Under the scientist\'s control, the robots emit fire from nozzles positioned on the lower part of their heads, encircle Superman, and pound him with their fists. Initially, the robots seem to have the upper hand, beating Superman to the ground, but Superman defeats them, sending the scientist running. When Superman catches up with him, he is holding a knife to the rope holding Lois\' platform above the molten metal, and threatens to cut it if he takes another step. Superman makes a move, the rope is cut, and Superman speeds across the room to catch Lois just in time, landing on a ledge below the pot of molten metal and the scientist. The scientist then pulls a lever to dump the hot liquid on them, but Superman shields Lois with his cape, then grabs the scientist and flies from the lair to take him and Lois back to the city. The film ends with a shot of the next issue of the Planet, describing the latest adventure -- Superman stopped the mechanical monsters, the scientist was arrested and the jewels are recovered. In the office, Clark says "That\'s a wonderful story, Lois." She replies, "Thanks Clark, but I owe it all to Superman." Clark smiles.'] ['An example of the film\'s comedic tone comes in the opening monologue, which spoofs the opening of COPS: "TROOPS is filmed on location with the men of the Imperial Forces. All suspects are guilty--period! Otherwise, they wouldn\'t be suspects, would they?" A small visual gag near the beginning of the film is that the stolen Imperial droid recovered from the Jawas appears to be Tom Servo from Mystery Science Theater 3000. In TROOPS there is a notable alternate  take on the deaths of Luke Skywalker\'s Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru, presenting their fate as the end result of a domestic dispute gone too far, rather than execution at the hands of Imperial forces. Indeed, the spotlighted members of Black Sheep Squadron attempt to mediate the dispute before Beru makes a disastrous move with a thermal detonator. The film ends with an incoming message about a possible disturbance in Mos Eisley Cantina.'] ['One evening while eagerly awaiting a date with Daisy, Donald Duck realizes he doesn\'t have any money. "I\'m financially embarrassed!" he moans while pondering what to do. Then he sees Huey, Duey, and Louie\'s piggy bank, and following a brief battle with his conscience, takes it. After sending the nephews to bed Donald breaks open the piggy bank, takes the money , and goes on to have a wonderful time with Daisy. Later that evening Donald drops Daisy off at her house. She kisses him and calls him a "big shot." As Donald starts walking home, his conscience tells him "Yes sir, she thinks you\'re a \'big shot!\' You probably look like a millionaire to her... but you\'re NOT!" His conscience then points out that bank robbery is a federal offense. Donald starts to feel guilty for having stolen the money and starts to run, imagining that federal agents are chasing him. As the film continues his visions become even more disturbed and nightmarish. At last Donald corners himself in a dark alley and thinks he is in jail. He frantically grabs the bars of a door window and shakes it. "Let me out of here! Let me out!" A sign falls off and hits him in the head. It\'s a \'help wanted\' sign, and Donald discovers the door is just the service entrance of an all night cafe. Donald works through the night and pays the boys back, "and a nickel besides." However, when the nephews wake up, they see Donald trying to take the extra nickel from the rebuilt piggy bank and think he is stealing. Donald\'s conscience says "You see, chum? Crime doesn\'t pay."'] ['The film starts off with two girls talking to each other in a movie theater. Suddenly, an old man sits next to them and starts to tell them a scary story that he claims is true. The story is about a man named Alex who has just moved into an old house at 3 Blood Street. He is excited about moving in, until his friend Thomas points out that the house is dripping blood onto him. Alex is nonchalant about this, saying that it is just the house\'s paint job, although Thomas observes that nothing is painted this color. They ignore this, but after more blood drips on Alex later, the pair agree to approach the landlord to report the "leak". The next day, they discover that the landlord\'s office is vacant, and it looks like it has not been used in years. Alex finds this odd, saying that the office was open yesterday. Alex hopes the landlord will call him and explain the dripping blood, but starts to worry as the problem continues. Thomas explains the whole story to his friend Bobby the next day. When Alex meets up with them, Thomas offers Alex a place to stay until the problem stops. Alex declines, saying that he is not going to let some "leak" make him move. Later, Alex goes up to the attic to investigate the source of the blood. He discovers his own dead body on the attic floor, causing him to panic. The film cuts to the present day, where the old man finishes his story. The previews start, and the first trailer is for a horror film called "3 Blood Street" that has the same plot as the old man\'s story. When both girls look at the old man, he has become a skeleton, causing the girls to scream.'] ['The episode starts at the Krusty Krab, when SpongeBob and Squidward get so hot because Mr. Krabs has not paid the electricity bill.

Mr. Krabs has SpongeBob making Krabby Patties and himself doing what he normally does, counting money. When the trio are on one surfboard Mr. Krabs, Squidward and SpongeBob meet up with Patrick and Sandy. Patrick tries to climb onto the board, but he causes it to tip. Patrick starts swinging his arms and this causes the board to move uncontrollably. It collides with Sandy and a tidal wave suddenly sweeps the five friends up into separate places: SpongeBob, Patrick and Squidward go to an island with young surfers, Mr. Krabs ends up stranded in the middle of the sea with his cash register "Cashie", and Sandy is taken to a small island in the middle of nowhere. SpongeBob, Patrick and Squidward are told by the young surfers that the only way to get back to Bikini Bottom is to surf there; unfortunately they do not know how to. Despite the efforts of the surfers, SpongeBob, Patrick and Squidward seem unteachable and don\'t seem to be taking anything in. Twitch, one of the surfers, tells them that there is one other person who can teach them to surf: Jack Kahuna Laguna  . SpongeBob, Patrick and Squidward are told that they must sail down a river until they find the Kahmamoku Cove, "where every wave is perfect". After they find the cove, JKL comes out of his hut and surfs on an enormous surfboard which astonishes the three friends. Afterwards, he tells them, "just keep breathing." He later says that they have to ride a wave called "the Big One", in order to get back home. They practice surfing for some time, then get ready to ride "the Big One". Before they set off, JKL announces that "the Big One always demands a sacrifice. One of you... will not return."

He orders Mr. Krabs to give him Cashie\'s money so he can buy some more groceries, but Mr. Krabs is reluctant to let Cashie go. He promises that he will "never soil the Dutchman\'s waters again", swearing on his aunt Sally\'s false teeth. The Dutchman gets angry at this; he knows that Mr. Krabs\' aunt Sally doesn\'t wear false teeth because he dated her in high school. Upon hearing this, Mr. Krabs releases Cashie and the Dutchman accidentally tosses it away. It crashes through Sandy\'s helicopter, causing it to fly off course and hit the Dutchman on the head. Cashie reappears from under the water, much to Mr. Krabs\' delight.

The movie follows Dominicus as he traverses the American midwest, plying his trade as a cigar salesman, and his dawning realization that he may have sold his soul to a multinational corporation.

In the entire 12 minutes, the old woman racially abuses the black man, stating that blacks stink, are unintelligent, criminal and the perfect carrier for AIDS. The biker feels uncomfortable, but does not dare to interrupt. The black man stays quiet for the entire film, until the tram controller arrives: when the old woman produces her ticket, he grabs and swallows it. When the old woman accuses the black man of eating her ticket, he coolly shows his valid ticket to the controller; the latter nods at him and arrests the old woman. The punch line is that both the black man and the old woman are "Schwarzfahrer" now: the black man who rides a train, is a non-offensive "black rider", while the old woman now is a real law-breaking Schwarzfahrer . The one passenger the viewer knows who never possessed a ticket, the motorbiker, escapes without the controller checking his ticket.'] ['Betty holds a "Betty Boop Exposition", where she displays the latest modern inventions.

Elmer frantically digs into the hole while Bugs emerges from a nearby hole with a carrot in his mouth. He lifts Fudd\'s hat and raps the top of his head until Elmer notices, then chews his carrot a bit before delivering his definitive line, "What\'s up, Doc?". Elmer explains that he\'s hunting "wabbits", and Bugs chews his carrot while asking what a wabbit is.

The gorilla looks very rough with exposed metal and large sewing marks along its chest. It sits there and chews on some of the wood from the platform. The short then cuts to the small girl working across a beach and through a forest towards the workshop.

The girl blows on the rabbit causing it to dissolves into a stream of golden dust which flows into the hole in the gorillas head, the top of the head promptly clamps back onto the rest of he head. The gorilla then starts to glow and whites out the screen. When focus is returned, the inventor, assistant and the girl are standing outside on a grass verge, the gorilla then falls onto this verge, however now is completely lifelike with clean movement and fur. The inventor, in an unimpressed voice, remarks "seem it all before" at which the gorilla now under a spot light and waring a tuxedo jacket begins to sing in an opera styling causing a deer to shed a tear from the beauty of its singing. After another round of ridicule from the inventor and assistant the gorilla pulls two cymbals from behind its chest and bangs them together like a cymbal monkey causing them to change their minds and congratulate themselves on how well it works, completely ignoring the girl. They then proceed to walk off together discussing their next animal design while the gorilla walks off with the girl.'] ['A mother tells her daughter a real life fairy tale of a "Princess Charming" and her Sleeping Beauty.

To his disappointment, it is merely a rubber mouse. He hears his hated rival Tweety singing Jingle Bells in his cage, which has been gift wrapped and addressed to Granny. Just before she enters the room, he switches the cage\'s tag so it\'s addressed "To Kitty" instead. Granny innocently gives the cage to Sylvester and opens the box with the rubber mouse. Believing there has been an innocent mix-up, she goes to give Sylvester the mouse and correct the mistake. Upon seeing a satisfied Sylvester hiccup Tweety\'s feathers, Granny realizes what has occurred and angrily forces Sylvester to regurgitate Tweety. After giving the wayward cat a scolding, Granny insists that Sylvester kiss Tweety under a sprig of mistletoe. Sylvester eats Tweety Bird again instead, and is once again scolded and forced to spit him out. Granny places Tweety\'s cage up high where Sylvester shouldn\'t be able to reach him. Undaunted, the ever-resourceful feline retrieves a ladder, climbs up to Tweety\'s cage, and opens it with the intent to eat him. Tweety Bird manages to convince Sylvester that a huge present waiting under the Christmas tree is for Sylvester. Sylvester abandons Tweety in his greed, and opens the present with relish. It turns out to be Hector the Bulldog, who promptly eats Sylvester. Granny arrives and forces Hector to spit out Sylvester, and then throws the dog out of her house. Sylvester then attempts to get to Tweety by using a toy steam crane. Instead, he catches an angry Granny, who chases and bashes Sylvester with a broom. The feline retreats to the second floor of the house and attempts to saw a hole in the floor so as to be able to descend upon Tweety from above. Tweety replaces himself in the cage with a stick of lit dynamite, which goes off just as Sylvester pulls the cage up to his level. Sylvester then puts the wrecked cage back and stumbles down the stairs, blackened and torn up from the explosion. He next attempts a Western-style showdown with Tweety; himself playing the part of Geronimo, with Tweety playing Hopalong Cassidy. After being shot by a pop-gun , Sylvester wins, but before he can consume his prize, Granny shoots a plunger over his mouth, and declares, "You didn\'t count on Pocahontas, did you, Geronimo?" While Tweety plays on his new train set, Sylvester tries one last time to catch him. He takes some spare train tracks, sets them up to point towards his open mouth, and the puts the train in reverse. The train goes over the new tracks, and towards Sylvester who then devours Tweety, only to be devoured himself by Hector the Bulldog who has somehow gotten back in the house. Granny whacks Hector until he coughs up Sylvester, and then does the same to Sylvester until he coughs up Tweety. Granny announces she\'s had enough, and that she\'ll show Sylvester and Hector there will be peace in the house once and for all. The cartoon ends with Granny and Tweety singing a variation of the Christmas carol "Hark The Herald Angels Sing". On Tweety\'s right and left are Sylvester and Hector, both with "Do Not Open Til Xmas" stamps over their mouths.'] ["Married in Canada follows seven American couples, 3 gay male and 4 lesbian couples, deciding to benefit from Canadian legalized marriage laws to get married in Toronto, while they are prohibited from doing so in the United States in their resident states. The couples and their families illustrate why overcoming the obstacles to legal nuptials is worthwhile, despite the reality that once back home south of the border, the newlyweds will remain merely 'married in Canada' as their marital status will be unrecognized. The marrying couples also candidly discuss differences in attitude between Americans and Canadians based on their experiences in Canada including human rights, homophobia, openness of society and acceptance of the other. The film also takes an inside view on a Canadian agency catering for cross-border same-sex marriage packages to the United States and other countries."] ['Three men and a horse stand in a field.

Dressed in only a nightgown, Zoe pounds on a neighbour's door where she gets into a physical altercation with the neighbour. As her children witness the incident, she screams 'No one hits my kids and gets away with it.' Tensions remain high as the two women and their children shout at one another and hurl insults. At Zoe's prompting, herself and her children make obscene gestures to the neighbour. They all head home, with the children asking for chips. A man then pulls up in a car and is curious as to who the children are. Zoe tells him that they belong to a mate of hers and she is just looking after them. He asks her if she would like to go for a drink. Zoe is a bit hesitant at first and she agrees to meet him at the pub that evening. Zoe reveals to her children that the man's name is David and her children seem excited about this, as there is the allusion to 'David' Beckham. . They return to their home and Zoe attempts to find a sitter for the children. She is unsuccessful in her attempt. As she speaks to her friend on the phone, she feeds sugar to her children, telling them to 'share it out, not too much.' Zoe then notices a wasp flying near one of her windows, which she opens to release it. The next scene shows Zoe wearing an extremely short skirt. She is accompanied by her children who ask where she is going, to which she replies that she is going to the pub. She tries to placate her children by telling them that there will probably be other kids there. Zoe promises her children that she will buy them something to eat at the pub. After all, their last meal consisted of pure sugar. When they arrive at their destination, Zoe leaves her children outside the pub to fend for themselves. She enters the pub in order to look for David. She eventually catches his eye; he is playing pool. David states that since Zoe is 'one of those modern girls,' she should purchase the first round of drinks herself. A reluctant Zoe goes up to the bar and orders drinks. It is clear that she is strapped for cash as she constantly amends her order in order to have the cheapest possible option. Meanwhile, her children attempt to amuse themselves outside of the pub. Zoe brings them crisps and a glass of Coke. Her children are upset because Zoe did not bring them chips. She attempts to entertain them by dancing and singing. Zoe instructs her oldest child, Kelly, not to come in and get her unless it is a real emergency. That being said, she enters the pub once again to see David with whom Zoe then plays pool. In the next few shots, we witness the children amusing themselves by playing outside the pub and entertaining one another. Meanwhile back in the pub, Zoe and David are becoming well acquainted with one another. Zoe seems oblivious to the fact that her children are bored and waiting outside the pub. She seems focussed upon the fact that she is having a good time and is oblivious to the needs of her children. The female patrons of the pub are exceptionally critical of her behaviour and say that she will not be laughing when she has her kids taken off her by Social Services. When Zoe checks on her children, who have been waiting outside the pub for hours, they are not pleased that Zoe wants to spend more time with David. They are bored, starved, and want to go home. David then emerges from the pub. Zoe and David spend some time getting to know one another in David's car. They begin to kiss and the camera cuts to Zoe's baby crying. It is obvious that the children are very hungry and want to go home. Four males exit the pub, one of whom drops some chips and ribs which Kelly eagerly picks up and shares with her siblings. Things then become quite heated between David and Zoe, who indulge in their passions in David's car while Zoe's children forage for food. Matters between David and Zoe are interrupted when one of her children emits an ear piercing shriek. Zoe then extricates herself from the car when she hears her child's cry. She then witnesses a wasp crawling into her baby's mouth and pleads 'don't sting him.' The wasp flies away and Zoe becomes enraged when she notices that there are remnants of ribs around her baby's mouth. Zoe responds by violently shaking Kelly and screams: 'I told you to look after him, didn't I?' After chastising Kelly, the family then embraces and Zoe apologises. The next shot shows the children eating in David's car and Zoe looking very troubled. David indicates to Zoe that he wants to have a chat. The last shot of the movie show David's car driving away and Zoe's children singing 'Hey! Baby.'"] ["When Porky finds a golden egg in his henhouse, it was revealed that one of the geese laid it.

He dives after an unsuspecting Jerry, and when Jerry spots him, Tom chases him into a vent pipe. However, Tom is squeezed through the hole in his board and bounces around through the pipe. Tom crawls through successively shorter widths of pipe in order to reach the mouse, and when the chase exits the plumbing, Tom is compressed into a cylinder with legs barely a centimeter wide. When the cat realizes this, he takes a deep breath and uncompresses himself. Tom grabs a large hose and dashes after the mouse. Jerry has opened the crate of cheese and is munching away at it when Tom thrusts the hose in his face. Jerry braces for the deluge, but when Tom opens the hose, nothing comes out because it is not turned on. Tom rattles the hose cluelessly and Jerry turns it on. The stream of water and the hose blast the cat around randomly until the hose forms a rocket and Tom blasts off into the stratosphere. An astronaut doing a spacewalk from the Gemini spacecraft waves at him. Tom then points the hose upward, and then soon sees he\'s about to fall.

Foghorn is playing solitaire, and the Dawg approaches from behind with two large clash cymbals, striking them together twice, once over Foghorn's head and the second time with Foghorn's head in between. Foghorn counters by taking a pie from a nearby windowsill, then mashing it into Dawg's face . The Dawg, his face covered with cream, chases Foghorn but is strangled by his rope. Foghorn returns, and like a barber, uses a straight razor to remove the cream from the Dawg's face. The Dawg becomes incapacitated when Foghorn places a large metal pipe over his body. Foghorn then gets a scalding hot towel from a pot of boiling water and places in on the helpless Dawg's face. Henery enters the scene looking for a chicken. Henery approaches the Dawg, who is sharpening an ax on a grinder, and thinking the Dawg is a chicken tries to pull him from behind with the Dawg's neck rope. The Dawg explains that he is not a chicken, and then points to Foghorn who is in the distance. Henery starts out after Foghorn but the Dawg stops him and states that Henery has to out-trick Foghorn if he is going to catch him. Henery attracts Foghorn's attention by trying to secure a catapult with a large pumpkin on it. Foghorn helps Henery by securing the catapult for him, and as he walks away Henery launches the pumpkin at Foghorn, which hits him in the head. Henery tells Foghorn that he wants to capture him for dinner. Playing along, Foghorn replies that he is too old and tough to be used for dinner. Foghorn tells Henery that a better choice would be pheasant under glass. Henery, not knowing what pheasant is, asks Foghorn where he can find one. Foghorn naturally points to the Dawg's house, telling Henery that a pheasant lives inside. Foghorn provides Henery with a glass cover and Henery walks into the Dawg's house and places it over him. The Dawg runs out with the glass over him but is again constrained by his rope. With the Dawg temporarily immobile, Foghorn returns with a set of golf clubs, placing a golf ball on the Dawg's nose. Foghorn swings, but hits the Dawg instead of the ball, sending the Dawg  toward a tree. Foghorn then covers Henery with vanishing cream and Henery is led to believe that he is invisible. Henery, still under the impression that the Dawg is a pheasant, leaves in pursuit. The Dawg uses a mirror to prove to Henery that he is not really invisible and that he has been tricked again by Foghorn. The Dawg runs out of his house but is stopped by the rope again and Foghorn returns with an accordion which he stuffs over the Dawg's head while playing the instrument. Foghorn convinces Henery to resume his quest for the pheasant, citing historical episodes. The Dawg finally explains to Henery that as a chicken hawk he should be after chicken and asks Henery to unhook his from his rope. The Dawg lures Foghorn from hiding and they start a fight. The story closes with Henery next to a pot of boiling water, saying to the audience that, pheasant or chicken, he will fricassee the loser."] ['Yolonda  is a young woman fleeing an unwanted commitment.

D.; the camera pans past a billboard announcing "Another Appian Freeway for Your Safety " before settling on an exterior view of the Coliseum. As spectators file into the Coliseum, their shadows fall on a poster describing the day\'s sporting event: :"Detroit Lions in Season Opener &mdash; Undefeated Lions out for First Taste of Victory" The sign was a reference to the NFL team with the same name, which was a league powerhouse at the time. The NFL Lions had appeared in the league championship game in the three seasons prior to the short being released, winning the title in 1952 and 1953. A radio-style sportscaster describes the scene for his audience and the entrance of Emperor Nero into the arena . Nero is represented as a caricature of actor Charles Laughton who had played the character in The Sign of the Cross in 1932. The announcer reports that Nero has "consented to throw out the first victim". When it turns out they are all out of victims, Nero commands Captain of the Guard Sam to take his legion out to get one . Along the way, Sam and the legion  cross paths with Bugs Bunny who is looking at them expecting a parade. Sam sends his troops after Bugs but he trips them with his foot. Sam then chases after Bugs in a chariot where he once again is victim of the "giddyap! horse/whoa! horse" routine. Through the rest of the picture, Sam and Bugs are running through the labyrinth of the Coliseum where the lions seem to be lurking behind every other door. Sam ends up near a lion\'s cage and hits it on the head as Bugs opens the cage causing the lion to attack Sam. Sam goes through a door and locks it only for the lion to grab the rug underneath him and pull him in to attack him. Yosemite then chases Bugs into a large underground room, full of sleeping lions. Sam unknowingly follows him in and sees Bugs sneaking toward the ladder. Bugs gets out and lowers an alarm clock on a rope through a grate into the room, which wakes the lions who attack Sam as he escapes. He then nears a pit of lions with Bugs at the other side. As Sam makes is way across with stilts, Bugs gives the lions some axes and saws which they use to cut the stilts down and attack Sam as he tries to get back to the other side. Bugs finally escapes but accidentally gets himself in the middle of the arena. Sam victoriously joins Nero in his box as the lions are released. The lions run by Bugs  and straight to Sam and Nero who take refuge atop a tall column. Bugs puts on a Roman crown and says: "Well, as the Romans say, E Pluribus Uranium".

As the camera pans across the course, we see Tom trying to hit a ball out of a giant divot, and finally hits the ball out on his 50th attempt. When Tom takes the flag out of the hole, the ball promptly drops itself in...and quickly bounces out. Tom is surprised by this, and lifts the green, rolling the ball into the hole. When the ball is thrown out again, he putts. After it is thrown out again, the cat shoves the ball into the hole and pounds the end of his club in after it, and the ball promptly whacks into the cat\'s eye. It is then revealed that Jerry lives in the hole on the golf course, and he was the one throwing the ball out. Jerry looks at Tom and draws an eyeball on the golf ball, which enrages the cat and causes him to swing at the mouse; his club misses and wraps around Tom\'s own neck. Jerry escapes temporarily, but is caught when Tom hits his golf ball onto Jerry\'s head, knocking him silly. The next scene shows that Jerry is being used as a tee and Tom places a ball on his head. Tom then readies his shot, which cuts out a huge divot while Jerry simply held onto Tom\'s club and the ball. Tom looks far off into the distance to see where his ball is, but Jerry whistles and holds up the ball. Tom then puts Jerry through the ball cleaner, and the mouse responds by spitting soapy water in Tom\'s face. Jerry is then forced into holding the tee with the ball on it; Tom hits the ball and poses with his teeth showing, which proves to be a mistake when the ball hits a huge boulder and bounces directly back the way it came, and it shatters all his teeth above and all his teeth beneath. In the next scene, Tom\'s ball is in front of two skinny, long trees. Tom cannot stand behind his ball to hit it, so he is forced to split the trees to hit his ball. The trees smash his head, apparently decapitating him, and Tom\'s body walks around and stands directly under it, somehow reattaching the head to the body. The ball ends up in a tree and triggers a "slot machine" display on the trunk. Three lemons appear on the reels, so Tom peeks inside the trunk, and an avalanche of golf balls comes out of the tree, tripping the cat. Annoyed at this, Tom returns to his game, but Jerry has replaced his ball with a woodpecker egg. After Tom hits the egg, the egg hatches and the bird comes back to peck on Tom\'s head, pecking out the blade of the golf club such that the head lands on Tom\'s head. Tom tries to hit another ball, but Jerry has hollowed it out such that it goes nowhere. Tom then places the shell on the chuckling Jerry\'s head and swings at the ball-mouse, which lands right next to the hole. Jerry, with the ball still on his head, dizzily prances around the hole, and Tom pokes him in after making sure that nobody is looking. Tom then takes out his scorecard and tries to figure out his score for the hole. He writes down 3 in his card , but Jerry scolds him and Tom writes 33 instead. When Tom tees off on the next hole, Jerry ties the club to Tom\'s tail; Tom ends up flying into the hole, leaving only his head exposed. Jerry sets up a putt and hits the ball toward Tom\'s mouth, then whacks the cat on the head, forcing Tom to scream in pain and swallow the ball. Jerry runs away and the incensed cat emerges from the hole, but continually runs into his own clubs. Tom then swings a ball toward Jerry with some English on it, which scoops up the mouse and brings him back to Tom. Tom swings, which sends a tiny divot with ball and mouse through the air. Jerry uses the divot like a B-52 and drops the golf ball towards Tom like a bomb. Tom digs a trench to protect himself, but the ball opens to reveal a smaller black ball, which explodes. Meanwhile, Jerry\'s divot crashes into a tree which Tom pokes at with the club; in response, the mouse grabs the club and pokes back. Tom then climbs into the tree and Jerry spanks the cat with the club, which causes the cat to peek out at the other end of the tree where a beehive is hanging. The bumblebees swarm around Tom\'s head, and he slowly realizes the situation, dives into and out of the tree, and hides in a bush. Jerry, not to be denied the pleasure of humiliating the cat, runs the bush over with a lawn mower revealing Tom shaved like a French Poodle. The bumblebees then chase Tom over a lake hazard, where a stick of bamboo is seen; Tom hides under the water and is using the stick of bamboo like a snorkel, so he can hide underwater where the bumblebees cannot reach him. Jerry then whistles to get the bumblebees\' attention, turns a \'150 yds.\' sign around to say Guess Who? and points it at the bamboo stalk. The queen bee looks through the bamboo stick to see Tom, who spits water in her face. Enraged,the queen leads the swarm on a bombing run down the stick. Jerry then places a funnel on top of the bumblebees to assist them in dive-bombing through the stick and into Tom\'s mouth. The water is shown for a few seconds, with a drum roll playing, and then all the water flies into the sky for a moment. Tom jumps out and lets out a frightening and loud scream. Jerry then takes a driver and hits a long drive, which hits Tom square on the head from a far distance, knocking him out.

The sequence in the book where the cat balances all sorts of objects on a ball, then crashes, is left out. Also differing is the role of Thing 1 and Thing 2; in the original book, they were simply things the cat brought along to demonstrate fun, but in this special, they are commissioned to help find the cat\'s "moss-covered three-handled family gradunza." The vocabulary used in the special is also of a much higher level than the book, though still in Seuss\'s trademark rhyme. After the Cat makes his entrance and fools around a bit, the Fish requests that he leave. He does so, but then comes back in, claiming that his "moss-covered three-handled family gradunza" has been stolen, and he accuses the Fish, who is given the name Karlos K. Krinkelbein in the special. The Cat sings a ballad about the loss of his treasured keepsake and then tries to describe it to the kids, even though they don\'t understand what he\'s talking about. The Cat then leads the kids on a search through the house, using his method of "Calculatus Eliminatus", which involves writing marks on every place they\'ve already checked. This makes a mess of everything, and Mr. Krinkelbein demands that the Cat leave once again, but it only prompts the Cat to sing another song, this one about feeling pessimistic and having low self-esteem . Then he proceeds to put the cynical fish to sleep by singing a lullaby. Once that\'s done, he brings out Thing One and Thing Two, singing to the kids that they can find "anything under the sun", all the while the Things play sports using Mr. Krinkelbein\'s fishbowl as the ball/puck.  Mr. Krinkelbein then becomes angry and accuses the Cat of not being a real Cat , and his hat of not being a real hat. This cues arguably the wackiest song in the special, where the Cat sings out his name in several languages . The song becomes so catchy that everyone, even Krinkelbein, joins in and contributes alternative translations for languages like \'Eskimo\' and Russian . Just as they finish up the song, though, they hear the mother coming home. The Cat then proceeds to clean up the house, just like in the book, using a motorized vehicle. Just as he leaves, the mother returns, telling the kids that she just saw a Cat in a Hat "going down the street with a moss-covered three-handled family gradunza." This tends to suggest that the "gradunza" was a strange vehicle the Cat drove around the house as he cleaned it up; in any event, its exact nature remains a mystery to the viewer.'] ['The park ranger at Niagara Falls boasts about his impeccable record of enforcing the prohibition related to going over the falls in a barrel.

Bush delivering the State of the Union address and cross-dissolves into a newspaper headline about the Madrid train bombings of 2004. The audio is composed primarily of a ringing telephone. A young man named John O\'Hara  is shown lying on his bed and looking depressed. The audio segues from the ringing phone to a conversation with his father wherein his father urges him to get a job and then, as if to undercut his son\'s confidence, offers to mail him a check. John, apparently bored, leaves the apartment, bringing the newspaper along with him. The next scene takes place in a restaurant, as John enters and sits at the bar. A beautiful blonde sizes him up as he takes the stool next to her. After much glancing back and forth, she begins a conversation with him wherein she flatters him and, apparently mistaking him for being wealthy because he\'s not working and is reading the stock market section of the newspaper, tries to pick him up. John responds to her questions cautiously. She then hands him her business card, which reads "Sofia\'s Strip-o-Gram and Massage Service". Sofia  offers John a massage and a humorous exchange ensues. After he makes her laugh, she invites him to get stoned. John pays for both of their drinks, and the pair leaves. There is a cross-dissolve to John and Sofia standing in front of a shop window, inside of which is a luxurious display of chocolates. John declares that "it\'s the most expensive chocolate shop in the world", to which an entranced Sofia replies, "I know". John, attempting to be charming, offers to buy them each a chocolate. Sofia, saying that she needs to check her messages, tells him to go in and pick something out for her. John, surprised, goes inside. The soundtrack then changes to that of people frolicking at the beach as John enters. As he approaches the counter, the audio again changes&nbsp;— this time to both an airport interior and a German voice repeating a phrase again and again. As John reaches the counter, the salesgirl wraps up two lemon-mousse finger sandwiches for him. In superimposition, the elaborate ritual of preparing the cakes is shown. John pays a whopping $42.50 for the two treats and leaves. In the last scene, John and Sofia sit on the Brooklyn Bridge after having gotten stoned together. Sofia then opens up to John and tells him that she used to live with her ex-boyfriend and sometimes delivered drugs for him. She describes two trips that she took&nbsp;— one to a college in Vermont and another to Belgium and Prague. She then tells John the story of how her boyfriend was murdered and she was raped repeatedly by the killers. When John is shocked, she insists that she\'s fine now, as the event took place a year ago. John embraces her awkwardly, retracts his arm hurriedly, and then Sofia tells him to call her before leaving for an appointment.

Junior and Bob the Tomato field a question for Victor from Sausalito, California about obedience. Using their imaginations, Bob and Junior are transported to the Holy Land so that they can tell the show\'s story. Bob acts as narrator and provides Junior with some background information. The Israelites, having been held as slaves in Egypt, are liberated by Moses  and led to the Promised Land. However, they question God\'s methods and are prevented from entering the Promised Land for 40 years. Upon the completion of their exile, Moses has already died, and Joshua  has become leader of the Israelites. With everybody eager to finally reach the Promised Land after four decades of waiting, Joshua leads the Israelites to their new home, but are halted in their tracks by one big obstacle — the city of Jericho. The story is interrupted here for Silly Songs with Larry. "Song of the Cebu", introduced as a "sequential image, stereophonic, multimedia event", finds Larry on the countertop with a slide projector and a captive audience . The song, about a boy and three cebus  frequently goes off track and is interrupted several times by Archibald Asparagus. When the song ends abruptly and without any sort of conclusion, Archibald is furious and threatens to inform Bob about this utter failure of a song . When the story resumes, the Israelites are confronted by the defenders of Jericho , who taunt them from atop the city\'s great wall. Joshua explains that God has given this land to the Israelites and that therefore the defenders will have to step aside. They are met by more insults and smug jeering. When a slushy drink accidentally falls and hits Jimmy, they fall back and regroup. That night, the Israelites argue about what to do. Pa Grape wants to go back to Egypt, while Jimmy and Jerry are convinced that they need heavy firepower to destroy the wall and run off to construct their weapon. Trying to escape the arguing, Joshua wanders off in hopes that he can hear God for advice. During his solitude, Joshua meets the Commander of the Army of the Lord , who tells him how the Israelites are to take Jericho: they must march around the city once a day for six days, then on the seventh day they are to march around it seven times, blow their horns, and all yell at the same time. At this point, the messenger states, the walls of Jericho will fall. Joshua reports the plan to the rest of the Israelites the next morning. Naturally, this plan leads to some serious doubts. Jimmy and Jerry then show off their alternate plan: a giant rocket named "The Wallminator 3000" which the Israelites applaude . Joshua, however, insists that they agree to try it God\'s way, and they all proceed to Jericho. As the Israelites march around the wall, the city\'s defenders insult them all the more, turning their taunts into a choreographed musical number while the Israelites try to ignore them. However, the taunting turns to semi-frozen carnage when the Jericho defenders bombard the Israelites with slushy drinks. The end of the day finds Joshua facing the threat of mutiny from the slushy-soaked Israelites, with some ready to fire up the Wallminator and others ready to run back to Egypt. At this point, Junior intervenes and convinces them to continue with the plan God laid out. He explains that God\'s way doesn\'t always make sense, but provides examples of how it always works out in the end. Inspired by Junior\'s example, the Israelites agree to stick with the plan and, in spite of renewed and constant counter-attacks, march around the city for seven days as specified. On the seventh day they blow their horns and scream: at first nothing happens, but then cracks appear and the walls crashes down, just as God said it would. Joshua claims the land for his people, the defenders run away in panic, and the Israelites are finally allowed into the Promised Land. Bob and Junior wrap up on the closing countertop, reiterating the lesson in the film in that though God\'s way may not always make sense, His way of doing things is always the best way. As Bob and Junior leave, Larry arrives in his pajamas to start to show but learns too late that it\'s already over.'] ["Speedy Gonzales invades Granny's home and drives Sylvester to a nervous breakdown.

It looks down at its feet while chasing Jerry and discovers its modification, and in return, uses its tail as a lasso to retrieve Jerry. Meanwhile, stick-mouse draws a bow and arrow and fires it at the cat, who pulls the arrow out of its rear and promptly deflates its own torso. Stick-mouse runs away and camouflages itself as one of the flowers in a flowerpot on the blueprint; the cat suspects nothing, and while turned the other way, the stick-mouse ladles the cat with a fork as one would spaghetti, then runs away as it unravels itself. Both mice jump off the drawing board, with stick-mouse acting as a parachute, while stick-cat jumps down and bounces akin to a pogo stick until it comes face-to-face with a jet of water fired by stick-mouse. The cat disintegrates into white ink, and before anything more than its head can reform, Jerry sucks the cat into an ink pen and empties it into Tom\'s jar of white ink. The two mice shake hands, but soon hear Tom yawning, about to wake up; quickly, they alter a key measurement on the blueprint, and both mice narrowly return to their original positions before Tom sees them. Tom gets to work building his mousetrap, not noticing anything amiss.  After his trap is completed, Tom hides in anticipation as Jerry emerges from his mousehole and grabs a piece of cheese which Tom has tied to his creation. This sets off a complicated chain of events which eventually lead the release of a safe which is to flatten the mouse. Tom emerges from his hiding place and prepares Jerry for his demise by giving him one last cigarette, but the altered measurement causes the safe to land two feet closer to the mousehole - onto Tom instead of Jerry. The safe door opens, and Tom emerges, now cube-shaped like the safe\'s interior. Not knowing the real cause behind the trap\'s malfunction, he curses  over his failure and leans on the safe.'] ['A tilted figure, consisting largely of right angles at the beginning, grows by accretion, with the addition of short straight lines and curves which sprout from the existing design.

The Spartans defend the entryway to the cockpit of the plane in a parallel to how the Spartans in 300 defended the narrow pass of Thermopylae. In between fighting, the terrorists\' emperor Jerxes  holds audience with Leonidas while sitting on his "throne" . Jerxes criticizes Gerard Butler\'s performance as Leonidas in 300, by asking the Spartan King why he has to shout all of his dialogue, and pointing out that if he shouts less, the times when he does shout will have more dramatic impact. Leonidas responds to this by declaring that "I\'m not yelling, I\'m just passionate!"

David states that he would like to lose his virginity before he dies. The shocked representative attempts to talk David into meeting a celebrity, but David insists that losing his virginity is all he wants. This statement creates a minor media splash, much to the consternation of a Priest in the hospital. The Priest tries to convince him to have sex for love, while David insists “I don’t have time for love!” David meets with his ex-girlfriend Amy. During the visit Amy tells him that although she thinks of him often, she’s dating someone else. She leaves a letter with him and leaves. David stuffs the unread letter into his pocket and sneaks out of the hospital. He goes to a red light district and attempts to solicit a prostitute. The woman he approaches tells him to use the money to “buy something nice for your mother.” An upset David picks up bricks and starts throwing them at cars until he is arrested. When the priest picks him at the police station he asks him why he did it. David responds “I wanted to see how low I could go.” The priest finds the unopened letter from Amy and reads it.

She continues by writing she hopes he gets better soon, and she’s sure that when he does she’ll find a nice girl who loves him. The Priest knows what Amy does not, the cancer is spreading and “getting better” is not a possibility. Later that night the Priest wakes David up and takes him via motorcycle to see a prostitute.

She takes off his shirt revealing several tubes and scars coming from his chest. David explains that various treatments that he’s had. She responds by showing him her own scar. She tells him he’s handsome and asks if anyone has told him that. David replies people tell him how sick he is. She touches his shoulder and asks him if anyone touches him. David replies he is only touched by doctors who are checking vital signs. David asks the girl to lie in bed and hold him “that’s all that I want.” David cries while she gently holds and comforts him.

As a scam, Blackadder informs them he has invented a working time machine and wagers £10,000 each that he can bring back anything they ask for. His guests – Archbishop Melchett , Archdeacon Kevin Darling , Lieutenant George  and Lady Elizabeth  – announce that, if Blackadder is to win, he must bring back a genuine Roman centurion\'s helmet, the actual wellingtons worn by the Duke of Wellington on the day he won the Battle of Waterloo, and a really smelly pair of 200 year old underpants. Blackadder intends to scam his guests by dredging the items from his personal store. However, he is stunned to discover that the time machine, built by Baldrick  after plans by Leonardo Da Vinci, actually works. The pair first land in the Cretaceous Period, where they are attacked by a massive Tyrannosaurus. Baldrick uses his underpants to beat back the dinosaur, who takes one sniff and falls over dead. Lord Blackadder muses, "Fascinating. One of history\'s great mysteries solved. The dinosaurs were, in fact, wiped out by your pants." When attempting to reset the dials to return to the present, Baldrick reveals that this is impossible, as he never got round to writing the dates on them. After configuring the dials on instinct, Blackadder and Baldrick land back at Blackadder Hall at the court of Queen Elizabeth I, with Nursie  and Lord Melchett at her side. The Queen, mistaking him for his ancestor, Lord Blackadder, decides to behead him, unless he has a gift for her. Blackadder first offers a supermarket loyalty card, upon which the Queen screams, "Kill him!" He then offers her a Polo mint, which the Queen proclaims to be "the tastiest thing in the history of the world". She rewards him with her crown, then orders him away to bring back more breath mints on pain of having his head smashed in. On his way back to the machine, Blackadder literally runs into William Shakespeare . After receiving the Bard\'s autograph, Blackadder punches him in the face, remarking, "That is for every schoolboy and schoolgirl for the next four hundred years!" Blackadder tells Shakespeare that his plays, which will cause untold suffering for untold generations of youths, are nothing but people "in stupid tights... talking total crap," then kicks him in vengeance for Kenneth Branagh\'s four-hour Hamlet film. Stunned, Shakespeare asks, "Who\'s Ken Branagh?" Blackadder smugly retorts, "I\'ll tell him you said that, and I think he\'ll be very hurt!" Then, Blackadder returns to the machine and tries very hard to remember how the dials were set. He then sets the dials and is happy until the time machine materializes into a space battle. Blackadder quickly realizes that they may have gone too far and resets the dials again. After that, Blackadder and Baldrick land in Sherwood Forest and are captured by Robin Hood . However, Robin is horrified when Blackadder begins rattling off the flaws with his lifestyle. Blackadder smugly reminds the Merry Men that they face certain death if they\'re caught, live in total squalor in the forest with no toilet facilities, yet give all they steal to the poor, who do nothing but "sit on their backsides," waiting for the next cash instalment. Enraged, the Merry Men promptly shoot Robin full of arrows. Then Maid Marian , smitten by the "gorgeous" Blackadder, proceeds to have sex with him. Before leaving, Blackadder takes Robin\'s hat as a trophy. A further attempt to reconfigure the dials results in the time machine landing at the Battle of Waterloo and squashing the Duke of Wellington  just before the fighting begins. Blackadder steps out of the machine only long enough to steal the Duke\'s boots to win his bet. One last attempt to set the dials aright lands them at Hadrian\'s Wall in Roman Britain. Intriguingly, the wall is being guarded by Blackadder\'s centurion ancestor, with a Roman-era Baldrick as his shield-carrier. After stealing the helmet of a Roman-era George, Blackadder and Baldrick escape just ahead of a charging wall of Braveheart-style Scotsmen wearing woad. Back in the time machine, Blackadder is becoming more discouraged about ever going home, but Baldrick comes up with "a cunning plan". Baldrick mentions that dying men have their lives flash before their eyes and that, if Blackadder was about to drown, he might remember how the dials were originally set. Blackadder agrees with this, but instead almost drowns Baldrick in the time machine toilet. As Baldrick\'s life flashes before his eyes, he remembers how to set the dials to return home. Back in 1999, the party guests are very impressed by his trophies, but due to Blackadder\'s interference with history, Robin Hood is completely unheard of, William Shakespeare stopped writing plays and is instead credited as the inventor of the ballpoint pen, and Britain has been ruled by the French for two hundred years following Napoleon Bonaparte\'s victory at Waterloo. Horrified by the sight of a traditional garlic pudding and Archdeacon Darling wearing a tutu and ballet slippers, Blackadder leaps back into the time machine, screaming, "We\'ve got to save Britain!" This is accomplished by encouraging Shakespeare, flattering Robin Hood, and preventing the death of the Duke of Wellington. They then return home to collect Blackadder\'s winnings from the amazed partygoers. After Melchett comments what damage an unscrupulous person could do with a time machine, Blackadder perks up. He tells his friends to go upstairs and watch the New Year\'s festivities on television, assuring them he\'ll soon return. The four guests sit down to watch the broadcast of the royals and the prime minister arriving at the Millennium Dome. Blackadder – now the absolute monarch King Edmund III – steps from a limousine and is joined by Prime Minister Baldrick. The King is married to the beautiful Marian of Sherwood . BBC correspondent Jennie Bond gushes about the King\'s 98% approval ratings, the success of Baldrick\'s cabinet, and the dissolution of Parliament. The film ends with the Blackadders having finally triumphed, with their descendant having become the ruler of Britain and millennia from now, the ruler of the entire universe.'] ["Cobb stars as a small-town Georgian bank clerk with a talent for baseball.

The motorboat goes faster and faster, until it crashes into a tropical island. Bimbo flies into the air and lands in another boat, this one containing a topless (except for a strategically placed [[Lei  and dark-skinned Betty Boop. Bimbo and Betty, after nearly falling down a waterfall, are flung from the boat into a clearing surrounded by hostile trees, who torment the two. A group of savages appears, but Bimbo disguises himself by painting his face and sticking a bone in his hair. Bimbo is treated as an honored guest, and to a performance of Betty dancing the hula. A sudden rainstorm washes off Bimbo's disguise, and he and Betty make a hasty escape from the angry savages. After another rapid boat ride, Bimbo and Betty ride up the Mississippi River, where they attempt to kiss in private behind an umbrella . The hula performance by Betty Boop was a visual high point of this episode. Betty's hula dance appears to be closely modeled on the hula dancer that appeared in the opening live action sequence . This is one of the more apparent examples of the rotoscope technique which the Fleisher Studio used for realistic animation. The hula sequence was later reused for Betty's cameo in 1933's Popeye the Sailor and in 1934's Betty Boop's Rise to Fame."] ['The film opens with shots of the London streets in late afternoon, as people begin their commute home. The narrator reminds the audience that these people are part of the greatest civilian army the world has ever known, and are going to join their respective service before London\'s "nightly visitor" arrives. Listening posts are stationed as far away as the coastline and the "white fingers" of searchlights touch the sky. Soon the Nazi air force arrives and begins its nightly work, bombing churches, places of business and homes, the work of five centuries destroyed in five seconds. But as soon as it is morning the British people go back to work the way they usually do, demonstrating the British \'stiff upper lip\' attitude. Joseph Goebbels is quoted as saying that the bombings are having a great effect on British morale. He is right, the narrator says, the British people\'s morale is higher than ever.'] ['In a fishing village on the coast of Brittany, a young woman and her grandmother sit by a spinning wheel.

'Impaled' by director Larry Clark shows a casting for a porn film, not with the insecure women often displayed, but instead with insecure young men. 'Balkan Erotic Epic' by director Marina Abramovic is an erotic comedy about myths from the Balkan around the sexual organs. 'House Call'  is a vintage sex scene and comes closest to pornography. 'Sync'  only exists out of very fast cuts from different porn films and plays for about two minutes. 'Hoist'  is mostly an art film.

Halfway into the story, the dramatics  begin happening to Tom. At the particularly grim conclusion, Tom runs away and hides in a flowerpot as an evil scream is uttered. Upon hearing the voice say "And that, my dear children, concludes this evening\'s Witching Hour",  Tom sighs with relief, and is asked the question, "And you do believe in ghosts...don\'t you?" Gulping, Tom nods as if to say, "Yes, I do." Jerry has been observing the whole thing and laughing to himself, and proceeds to pull down the curtain and release it. The flapping noise scares the cat, who hides only to discover the curtain, still rolling up he sighs with relief for it is not what he thought it was. Jerry tiptoes away, and under the still-swooning cat, bursts a radiator water line, burning the cat\'s behind and launching him into the air making Tom yelp in pain. Tom escapes the stream and runs towards a closet, panting heavily as he holds onto the door. Behind him is a vacuum with a white nightshirt, which Jerry approaches and peeks at the cat from the vantage point. Seeing the cat still recovering from the second shock, he activates the vacuum, which appears to be a ghost. Tom hears it, and without looking behind him, knows that this is something very terrifying. He makes panicked gestures towards the vacuum and faints, upon which Jerry turns off the vacuum, pleased. To wake up Tom, he squirts him with a speedy jet of water from a bottle. Tom awakens with a start, spits the water out of his mouth, and shakes it out of his ears. Tom sigh with relief that the noise is gone. Once again, before Tom can recover from this blast, Jerry reactivates the vacuum and paces it towards Tom. The rug he is laying on gets sucked up, and Tom\'s tail is caught in the opening. Tom jumps out of the vacuum, running against the heavy gale as objects are sucked into the vacuum. He manages to grab a hold of the telephone receiver, but lets go when he is rebuked by the operator, and ends up holding onto the lower stair pillar. All of Tom\'s nine lives are sucked out and form a chain of cats holding on to each other. Life 9 bites Tom\'s tail, causing his host to yelp with pain and speed off, freeing all the other lives. Life 1 smiles at the camera as he is freed. Tom continues to run around the corner and bumps his head on the wall, whereupon 8 of the lives rejoin him, and the ninth swings his arms before following suit. Tom instantly recovers and hears the vacuum again, and tries to find somewhere to run, and sees a shocking scene: Jerry operating the ghost-vacuum. Jerry continues to flip the switch and invites Tom to laugh with him. It takes a few looks and a peek into the distance for the mouse to realize that the cat, instead of being scared, is standing behind him. Jerry gulps nevously after he notices this. He resignedly walks out, and then dashes behind the nightshirt and makes a neophyte attempt to scare Tom by making a ghostly noise and waving his arms. Tom\'s I-mean-business look finally catches on, and Jerry waves and narrowly escapes from the leap from Tom pouncing. Jerry runs towards a piano and prepares another, similar scare for the cat, but  it fails to work. They chase across the piano keys, and Jerry draws back a round piece of furniture and it hits the cat in the face. Just then after being woken up by all the noise, Mammy Two Shoes walks into the room with a rolling pin and a similar nightshirt on thinking there is a burglar in the house. Jerry turns around and runs up a baking ladder, and then hides himself in a tub of flour. As Mammy slowly sneaks through the hall, Tom turns the corner and sees her backside. Believing this to be Jerry and his vacuum again, Tom slithers across the floor and under the table, pounces on Mammy and bites her backside, causing her to scream. Off-screen, Mammy yells at the cat, hits him three times and throws him out, while Jerry pulls himself out of the tin of flour, waves at Tom, but soon runs into his own reflection on a vase, looking like a ghost. Jerry, in fright yelps in fear and runs to his hole. Jerry pokes his head out and makes a confused look at the camera as if to say "who was that?".'] ['Introduction: The title card is shown as a billboard behind which Wile E. Coyote is hiding, ready to chase the Road Runner. He starts the chase, until he runs into a large truck. Wile E. runs the other way, and the truck shows the credit. The chase ends in a win for the truck, and the Coyote emerges battered. A box with director Chuck Jones\' credit then squashes him. The Coyote throws the box away, and the shot freezes: COYOTE: Eatius Birdius. He resumes the chase, which freezes to show the Road Runner: Delicius-Delicius. The chase continues down the road until the Road Runner makes a U-turn. The Coyote turns around, then stops. The Road Runner completes the circuit around, meanwhile, and beeps as the Coyote turns around, causing him to leap back. The Road Runner starts off down the road and loosens it from its hinge briefly. Wile E. points worriedly and displays an "EGAD" sign, then an "!!" sign. He drops them and thinks of his new plan. 1. Wile E. hides in a manhole, and as the Road Runner passes over him, he pops out and fires a rifle. The bullet and the Road Runner are shown in slow time, with the bullet closing to within a half-body length of the bird. Then the Road Runner turns to notice the threat, lets out a beep and gears into super speed. The bullet then brakes in puzzlement and falls to the ground. Wile E. picks it up, and then it detonates. Behind another rock face , Wile E. paces until he comes up with a new plan. 2. Wile E. leaps out into the road with "1 sheet ACME Triple Strength BATTLESHIP STEEL ARMOR PLATE" in front of him; even this cannot stop the Road Runner from barreling through it. The Coyote stares in puzzlement at the resulting hole, which shows only the scenery behind him where parts of his body should logically be, then walks off the road in obvious distress at the massive trauma he evidently suffered. 3. While the Road Runner is feasting on bird seed and earthworms, the Coyote puts a lighted stick of dynamite on the end of a fishing line and casts it out. It lands next to the Road Runner, but then bounces and rolls underneath a large boulder, which causes the boulder to fly and ultimately drop on the Coyote. 4. Wile E. then puts on a Batman outfit and dives off a cliff. He finally gains traction just before falling onto some spikey rocks, and then flies in circles through the air. He continues to fly in a straight line, oblivious, until he smashes into a huge mountainside. The wings stick to the rock and the Coyote is left grappling in the air until he slams into the spikey rocks below. 5. The Coyote perches himself upon a high branch with an anvil attached to the end of an ACME rubber band. However, he cannot hold on long enough; his feet chafe on the branch, and he is slung directly into the ground with the anvil. Then, the band reactivates and lobs him directly up into the branch a second time. 6. Now, Wile E. attaches a dynamite stick to the end of a telescoping device in order to annihilate the Road Runner from afar. However, instead of launching the stick towards the Road Runner, the device knocks him backwards into a rock face. The dynamite is then pulled into the hole and detonates on the Coyote again. 7. Wile E. crafts a large "STOP! BRIDGE OUT" sign and then paints a landscape of a bridge being broken on a canvas. The Road Runner blasts through the corner of the canvas and continues through the road, while the Coyote emerges from his hiding place behind the sign, and suffers the effects of the painted landscape when he tries to run through it. This is a reversal of a usual gag, where the Road Runner can usually "jump into the painting", while Wile E. cannot. 8. The Coyote then mines a bridge with TNT, and expectantly waits behind the detonator. Unfortunately, the detonator fails to activate promptly. Wile E. steps on, pulls, and slams the switch onto the ground before he runs onto the bridge to continue the chase. However, now the controller activates and blows up the bridge with the Coyote still on it. 9. The Coyote crafts a makeshift jet bike from ACME Iron handle bars and an ACME jet motor, which launches without its owner ([[Powerhouse . Wile E. grabs at the end of it and manages to grope his way onto the jet bike. He keeps pace with the Road Runner around a mountain slope and up a cliff. It appears for a moment the bird is trapped. But then the Road Runner repeats his earlier move and U-turns at the edge of the cliff, whereas the Coyote flies off it while trying to adjust his line to collide with his foe.  Still in midair, Wile E. turns the power off and looks back as the bike stops directly before reaching safety. The Road Runner is on this perch, and beeps to get his opponent\'s attention. Wile E. is obviously angry, but when the Road Runner points downwards, everything is silenced when Wile E. realizes he is about to suffer gravity once again. He loses his grip on the bike and plummets toward the earth. The embarrassed Coyote breaks the fourth wall by holding up a sign that says "How about ending this cartoon before I hit?" His wish is granted; as the iris begins to close, Wile E. holds up a second sign that says "THANK YOU", and the cartoon fully ends. The End.'] [' In early 1950s suburbia, a young boy reimagines a climactic family conflict as a rip-roaring black-and-white outer space serial.

Very quickly, the other seamen came in and cushioned his fall. Remembering how unpleasantly ill-tempered their leader is, however, the seamen hurled the captain off the ship's side where he plunges into the water. Following that, they and Krazy began to celebrate the deed with some music and dancing. In a kitchen levelled with the main deck, an Oriental chef was trying to fry fish on skillets but notices the place was short in supply. The chef came outside and orders Krazy to do some fishing. Krazy takes a pole and casts a line. Moments later, something was caught, and Krazy starts to reel in. It turns out what was pulled in was the captain. Not very happy with the result, the chef throws a punch at Krazy but the cat ducked, and instead the captain was the one struck. The captain then hits back in a similar fashion. For the rest of the film, the captain and the chef punched each other repeatedly and Krazy was enjoying the sight."] ['While walking in a forest, Bugs Bunny wonders aloud how everyone is out to get everyone else; this is illustrated by hostile behavior as Bugs\' interacts with, among other things, a rock and a butterfly.

As Bugs is trying to figure out where he is, he looks at the Rue de la Paix, the Champs-Élysées, and the Eiffel Tower, he realizes where he is, and decides to "stroll down this boulevard and look over the monsewers and mademoysels" where two French chefs, Louis and François, both want to cook dinner specials for their restaurants, and both their dishes involve rabbits. They both spot Bugs and, after secretly measuring him while Bugs is not looking, attempt to catch him. But Bugs is already on to them, and is not caught. He asks François what he has in the tureen, to which François says he has a rabbit. Bugs asks if he could see the "rabbit" and François agrees, but after that, Bugs comments, "Hmm...sort of a short-eared critter, ain\'t he, doc?" That makes François realize in shock that he has entrapped Louis instead of Bugs and accuses Louis of stealing his rabbit, to which Louis replies that the rabbit is his, to which François points out that the rabbit is his and NOT Louis. That gives Bugs the perfect idea to trick the two chefs into fighting over who gets to cook him, to which Bugs whispers to the audience, "What a revolting display of temper," until François comes out on top. Bugs tricks François into believing he has a recipe for "a good old Louisiana Back-bay Bayou Bunny Bordelaise, a la Antoine" from the famed Antoine\'s of New Orleans. François asks for the recipe, which Bugs refuses. But he decides to demonstrate it on him. So he disguises François as a rabbit, pickles him, and stuffs him full of every spicy ingredient in the kitchen before placing him in a bowl of vegetables. Louis comes in and demands that Bugs, who Louis obviously mistakes to be François, that he get the rabbit back until François whacks him on the head with a mallet, making Louis see that François, who asks if he was expecting Humphrey Bogart, is the rabbit. Louis asks, "MONSIEUR FRANÇOIS, WHAT HAPPENED?!" To this, François tells him that Bugs knows the recipe from the famed Antoine, forcing Louis to demand that Bugs now show him the recipe. Bugs agrees and does the same routine to him then places them into an oven  with a carrot, which also has a stick of dynamite in it. After the dynamite explodes, the two goofy chefs, having survived the blast, jauntily sing Alouette, adding, with a cheer, "Vive Antoine!" To this, Bugs remarks as the cartoon closes, "Poi-sonally, I prefer hamboigah."'] ["When the holidays evoke a young girl's memories of her father, she is forced to choose between either continuing to run from them or embracing the spirit of Christmas.

The people of London prospered and were very happy. However, the good king fell ill, and his captain of the guard, Pete plundered and terrorized all of England, and worst of all, he did it in the name of the king. Until one day... Mickey, Goofy and Pluto, are three beggars trying to get money for some food. Mickey and Pluto try selling firewood for the winter, while Goofy sells flavored snow, but they are all unsuccessful. After singing a song expressing their dreams of "living like a king", Captain Pete\'s carriage passes, having stolen much food from the people of London, and burying the three heroes in the snow. The hungry Pluto sees a sausage stand out from the carriage and begins to chase, pursuing it into the castle of the king. Mickey knocks on the door to get his dog back, and one of the soldiers opens the door and lets him in, mistaking him for the prince. Pete scolds the soldier for letting anyone in, pointing out where the real prince is: taking his classes with his boring teacher, Horace Horsecollar. The teacher teaches the prince about trigonometry, while the latter looks out the window at the children playing in the snow. The prince, being discovered by his teacher, is mocked by his valet, Donald. The prince plays at provoking Donald, while the teacher is distracted while writing on the blackboard, to the point that Donald hits, unwittingly, the teacher, resulting in the teacher sending Donald out of the room, returning both to their boring studies. But the Prince soon hears a commotion outside: it is Captain Pete, who is roughly handling Mickey and Pluto. The prince orders them to be brought to him right away. Pete kicks Mickey through the door, and kicks Pluto out of the castle. Mickey, astonished to be in the king\'s palace, inadvertently knocks over many suits of armor, with one of the helmets falling on both his and the approaching Prince\'s heads. The two Mickeys are surprised to see that they are entirely alike in appearance. The prince tells the beggar that he is bored with his life: getting up early, studying all day, with every night parties and banquets and then go to bed early. So, when looking at the two in the mirror and realize that they can exchange a costume and take the role of the other, the prince reassures the beggar saying that to rule that requires only two things: "What a splendid idea, good thing I thought of it!" and "Guards, seize him!", and if there are any problems, everyone will recognize the true prince with his real ring. The prince, disguised as a beggar, down the window, fooling the Captain Pete, who believes he is the beggar. Pete throws the "beggar" out with a catapult. The prince meets Mickey\'s friend Goofy and Pluto, but does not recognise them at all. Meanwhile, Mickey is challenged with the prince\'s studies, such as chemistry, where the formula explodes in Donald\'s face, and falconry, where he is chased by the falcon. While the prince is trying to make a dog play with him by throwing a bone, all that does is make a group of dogs chase him in anger. After getting away, the prince sees a couple of soldiers trying to steal a chicken from Clarabelle Cow and her two children, saying it is for the king. But the prince in disguise orders them to return the chicken. The soldiers throw a pumpkin over him for a crown and leave, not believing he is the true prince. Children help him get up and explain that for years the soldiers take away their food and belongings in the name of the king. But a carriage, which carries food stolen from the village, goes by, and the prince stops it, showing the real ring. All bow to the Prince as he returns their food. But the soldiers, who had been called by the man driving the carriage, try to stop the prince, accusing him of fraud. The prince escapes with a little help from the other commoners, especially Goofy. Meanwhile in the castle, one of the soldiers tells Pete that one of the beggars had the royal ring. Pete is alarmed knowing then that the prince was cast out, and may see the corruption and theft going on outside. The soldier mocks Pete saying that he  is going to be punished dearly for it, but Pete answers that he won\'t if the prince never returns. The beggar, dressed as the prince, is called by Horace Horsecollar and told that he must see his "father", who is now dying. Mickey enters the room of the dying king, but does not have the heart to tell him that he is not the real prince. Instead, as the sick king tells him he must take his royal birthright and become king, he sadly promises. Shortly afterwards, the king dies. Mickey knows the true prince must be found as quickly as possible, but Captain Pete arrives behind him, and threatens Mickey to be crowned king at his orders, revealing that he had captured Mickey\'s dog Pluto as a hostage. Meanwhile, the true prince hears the bells announcing the death of his beloved father. Knowing that he should be king, the Prince decides to return immediately to the palace. But Pete appears and manages to capture him and puts him into the jail along with Donald, while the coronation begins. The beggar does not want to be king, but behind the curtain Pete is strangling Pluto. The prince orders the guard to let them leave, but he refuses to obey. A dark figure walks up the stairs: a hooded man armed with an axe. The guard believes the man is the executioner, but the man trips and accidentally knocks out the guard. Then he removes the hood: it is Goofy. Goofy tries to figure out which key opens the cell while the other soldiers arrive. In a panic, Donald finds the key for the cell, and the three flee to the coronation chamber. The beggar, struggling not to be crowned, finally stops the archbishop, and orders the guards to arrest Pete. But Pete defends himself by pointing to the beggar as an impostor. The Prince arrives in time before they kill the beggar and makes his entrance. The Prince and Captain Pete duel as many other soldiers are defeated by Goofy\'s clumsiness and Donald\'s cowardice. Finally, the Prince cuts Captain Pete\'s trousers loose, causing them to fall down and reveal Pete\'s underpants: a frilly, lacy pair of white panties with red heart prints. Pete tries to hold his trousers up during his attempt to escape from a large chandelier that has fallen and entangled some soldiers, but is tripped up by Mickey and the Prince, causing him to fall down. With his trousers down and his ruffled panties fully displayed, Captain Pete becomes entangled with the soldiers in the fallen chandelier that ends up rolling out of a large glass window and dropping down out onto the streets below to death. Mickey and the Prince then cheer because of their successful collaboration in defeating Captain Pete. The archbishop is confused and does not know who to crown, until Pluto recognizes the beggar, and the Prince shows his ring. The Prince is crowned King of England, and with Mickey and Goofy at his side, rules for many years with justice and compassion for all.'] ['The short opens on a small, white-shirted, worried group of mice wearing sombreros thinking of how to get cheese from the AJAX cheese factory across the Mexican-American border that is guarded by Sylvester the Cat.

Sylvester uses a bomb to blow up all the cheese but the cheese boxes only explode, and much of the cheese lands where the mice are, causing Sylvester to cry and bang his head on an electric pole in annoyance. Speedy then says "I like this pussycat fellow; he\'s silly!" and the short ends.'] ['The year is 1886, and Sergeant Bugs is assigned to protect a Cavalry outpost, Fort Lariat, from invaders.

As they are packing the master\'s clothes, Mr. Theeves requests that Droopy acquire someone to help him around the house while they are away, and the first person to come to Droopy\'s mind is his identical twin brother, Drippy.

Drippy arrives later on and displays his superhuman strength by punching his way through the front door before greeting Droopy. Droopy introduces Drippy to Mr. Theeves, who is briefly astonished by Drippy\'s uncanny resemblance to Droopy, thinking he was seeing double, and is also on the receiving end of Drippy\'s immense strength while shaking his hand. Mr. Theeves then explains Drippy\'s duties to him, and tells him that no matter what, no strangers are allowed on the premises.

He hides behind a tree, his teeth chattering and knees knocking. He is startled on seeing the audience, but calms down and explains, "You see, it\'s duck season, and, confidentially, I\'m a duck!" He then crawls across the meadow and takes a morning shower while singing "King For A Day{{dn}}". While he sings in the shower, a fox and Elmer Fudd approach the shower from opposite directions, each unaware of the other\'s presence. They reach into the shower to grab Daffy, but he emerges from the shower untouched. They look inside the curtain and see their literally fingers tied together, much to their annoyance. The fox and Elmer start grabbing at Daffy, but Daffy stops them. He tells them to race to a pine tree, and the first one to reach it "gets tender, juicy me as first prize". But when he fires the starting gun, only Elmer takes off; the fox stays behind, grabs Daffy, and flees. Daffy calls to Elmer and tells him he has been swindled. Elmer starts chasing after the fox. Meanwhile, Daffy deliberately squirts oil on the hill, and the fox slides downhill. At the bottom of the hill, Elmer aims his gun at the fox and demands that he leave. The fox turns to escape, only to run smack into a tree, knocking him out cold. Now Elmer turns his gun on Daffy. But Daffy puts Elmer on a guilt trip, melodramatically complaining about the misery of being constantly pursued by hunters. Catching Elmer off guard, he hits Elmer on the head with a mallet, knocking him out. A little later, Daffy is admiring himself in a mirror. Elmer puts on a semi-realistic female duck disguise and calls to Daffy from a pond. Daffy begins flirting with the duck, but dives underwater, sees Elmer\'s boots, and sees through his game. Still, Daffy plays along, and offers to bring some art collectibles for "her" to see. He slips away and awakens the fox  with a duck call. The fox sees the "female duck", grabs it, and runs away, until he notices the neck stretching. Curiously, he confusedly asks "What kind of a duck is this?" as he opens the lid of the duck costume, and Elmer pops out pointing his gun in the fox\'s face. Elmer, still in costume, chases after the fox, but is caught by the boot with a long rope, pulling him out of the costume and getting him entirely stuck in the boot, sadly asking himself, "How am I ever gonna catch that scwewy duck?" Daffy, who lassoed him, replies, "Precisely what I was wondering, my little nimrod!" Suddenly, the fox grabs Daffy by the throat and flees the area with him, trying to put as much distance between himself and Elmer. But just when he thought he had gotten far enough away, he turns and runs into Elmer and his gun. Elmer forces the fox to give up Daffy and sends him away. Then Elmer, by now greatly irritated, drags Daffy away to shoot him, while Daffy calls to the fox to stop Elmer. Elmer pins Daffy to a tree and squeezes the trigger, but instead of gunfire, there is a pop. The fox has returned and stuck his fingers in the gun barrel to stop Elmer. The fox and Elmer start cursing in each other\'s faces, and their argument turns to fisticuffs, while Daffy watches from atop the tree, cheering them on. While the fox and Elmer are fighting, a dog in a ranger uniform appears and nails two signs to the tree: DUCK SEASON CLOSED. and FOX SEASON OPEN. He blows a whistle. The fox and Elmer read the signs, and then Elmer glares menacingly at the frightened fox, who flees for his life. The dog gives Elmer a more appropriate hunting hat and a horse to ride, and Elmer chases the fox on horseback. As the fox, Elmer and his horse run into the distance, the dog pulls off his rubber mask to reveal Daffy in disguise, and he comments, "Obviously, I am dealing with inferior mentalities."

But because Oswald's baggage  was left outside, the suspicious guard decides to inspect the train.

The two uneasy friends were left wondering what they should do next. Suddenly, they saw roasted chicken on a window sill of a nearby house. The bear tells Oswald to filch it. Oswald was initially reluctant but ultimately agrees after getting strangled by the bear. The rabbit entered the house's yard and approaches the window, only to be chased out of the gate by the resident dog.

Upon exiting the gate, he was spotted by a patrolling cop, prompting him to leave quickly. Passing by his friend, Oswald tosses the food to the bear who catches it. The rabbit figured he'd rather run to somewhere than to be tormented by the cop.

While Sam complains about the result, Bugs Bunny wobbles into the shop with a gigantic piece of gold to trade for a couple roots of carrots.

Little Kitty is absent from this sequence. A poster is shown explaining that the school children are sponsoring a musical and recital for the benefit of teachers and parents. The school talent show first features Porky Pig reciting Paul Revere\'s Ride, but due to his excessive stutter . A small gag involves Porky pointing to offstage students to provide sound effects for his next poem The Charge of the Light Brigade . However, he points to the wrong student, but the intended student takes his cue, and Porky points to the correct one. The class children whistle and cat-call which makes several stray dogs burst into the schoolhouse and chase poor Porky out. Next up, Little Kitty attempts to recite "Mary Had a Little Lamb". She is so nervous that she forgets a couple lines  and then proceeds with the rhyme but gradually speeds up her voice to a high pitch. Throughout her performance she is fidgeting and crossing her legs in a way to suggest she urgently needs the toilet. She reaches the end of the rhyme as she makes a hasty exit, to a building that may be the school outhouse. Third, Ham and Ex sing the song "I Haven\'t Got a Hat", written by Buddy Bernier and Bob Emmerich. During this performance, Oliver Owl refuses to share some candy with Beans.

At the time , the three-strip process  was exclusive to Disney for use in cartoons.

The chase continues until the coyote stops to read a sign in the road: "WARNING: The Surgeon General has determined that chasing Road Runners may be hazardous to your health." He dismisses this sign as cheesy and laughs at it, before the Road Runner pulls up behind him and beeps the coyote into another headache. Within the outcropping, Wile recovers and sees another sign posted at the very end of the outcropping: "It\'s not cool to laugh at the Surgeon General." 1. Not deterred by this one bit, the coyote continues his dastardly plans: he leaves the Road Runner a free snack on the edge of a cliff while he sneaks up behind his enemy and tries to eat him. However, sensing the danger, the Road Runner extends his neck all the way around the screen and beeps in the back of the coyote. To explain this, he displays a sign that says "Road Runners are extremely flexible" and leaves the scene, while Wile E. falls back onto the cliff and is left looking like an accordion. 2. In a similar scheme to one used in the previous cartoon, Wile now locks and loads an ACME Giant Mouse Trap and leaves it in the road for the Road Runner to trip. When the trap snaps, the coyote jumps out to capture his opponent, but meets a giant mouse who is rather displeased with getting his tail caught and returns the favor to Wile\'s tail. 3. Still trying to make this gadget work, despite his failures with it, the coyote loads himself into a spring attached to a rock and lets go as the Road Runner passes. Voice of Spring plays on the music track as Wile E. ends up being carried across the plateau. Wile E. eventually moves into thin air, and soon catches on to the situation, gulps, and falls. As the spring unfurls through the air like a Slinky, the Road Runner ducks as the rock just misses him and dives all the way through the spring, ultimately landing on Wile, who is displaying a "HAVE MERCY" sign, just as he recovers from his massive fall. The coyote leaves this with his neck also coiled up like a Slinky. 4. With these newer cartoons come more ludicrous products, such as ACME Instant Road, which Wile E. rolls out across an arch and down the straight slope in an effort to get the Road Runner to follow him, until he runs out of road and he is left staring at the ground. He can only display a sign that says "In heaven\'s name - what am I doing?"  before he is overtaken by gravity and displays a "BYE!" sign. 5. Returning to conventional chasing and gags, the coyote tries to launch himself with a bow to chase the Road Runner, but the bow simply freezes without firing. He hangs in midair for a couple seconds before he realizes this, and attempts to fix it by playing dulcimer on the bowstring, until it activates and Wile spears a cactus. However, this gives the coyote a new idea, displayed by a lightbulb changing from "IDEA" to "CACTUS" repeatedly. 6. The ACME Trick-or-Treat Cactus Costume has arrived, and Wile puts it on, suffering rather discomfiting pain in the process. Finally, he gets it on and hops out into the road while the Road Runner is passing him. However, he fails to grab the Road Runner and wraps his arms around himself, causing massive pain due to the spines. After Catty Wile E. escapes from the costume, he kicks the box into the desert. 7. As the Road Runner pulls up to another outcropping and signals to the coyote, Wile attempts to see-saw his way over to his rival with a rock and board. However, when the rock lands on the other side, it causes the board to smash into the coyote, and the rock then lands on the thin edge of the board, resulting in it wedging the edge of the outcropping away. This falls to the earth, with Wile, the board, the rock, and two smaller rocks located next to the see-saw following it. As the board looms over the coyote, Wile heaves it into the air before a rock hits the ground, then the outcropping edge, followed by the coyote on the right and the other rock on the left. This causes the coyote to be thrown upwards and bump his head directly on the falling board before he drops on the right side of the outcropping edge and jumps the second rock onto himself, as the board wedges just to the right. 8. Another rather ludicrous ACME product: ACME Lightning Bolts  - takes up the remainder of the cartoon. With the safety gloves, the coyote grabs a lightning bolt and successfully sizzles a practice saguaro. He throws a second one at the Road Runner, who stops and takes stock of the situation, and turns the other way as the electricity chases him. The bolt and bird chase all over the mountains until they enter a tunnel. When they come out, the lightning somehow has overtaken the Road Runner, who beeps at the lightning to get it to reverse. The chase returns all the way back the way it came until the Road Runner escapes to safety up a mountain slope, while the lightning continues on its normal course - back to its thrower! Wile E.\'s eyes pop out and clash with each other in reaction before following the rest of him on the run from the lightning. The hapless coyote hurts himself repeatedly with white-hot lightning in his back, across the landscape and even off into the sunset.'] ['The filmmaker Jo Moon-kyung  and his friend Bang Joong-sik  swap memories about the trips they both made to the same town, where, as it turns out, they had met and befriended the same people.{{cite web}}{{cite web}}{{cite web}}'] ['In the 1930s America is suffering for the Great Depression.

Meanwhile, Wheezer continues searching for his pups, who run toward a bell — any bell — they hear; he says, "they think they\'re gonna get dinner." They hear a goat\'s bell, a fire engine bell, and a huge church bell, which Wheezer himself rings in a desperate attempt to find the pups. He sits on the curb dejected until the pups, who did hear it, scamper up to him for a happy reunion. Tying the two sub-plots together is a running gag in which first-time Our Ganger Dorothy DeBorba keeps jumping into a mud puddle, amusing the other children and irritating her mother, who keeps bathing her and changing her clothes. The last time this happens, she thinks it was Farina who pushed the little girl in — and falls in the mud herself.'] ['A lonely man on the brink of emotional desolation talks to his Oatmeal.

Jerry is walking out, preparing for a new day, when he spots Tom tiptoeing to the canary. As Tom steals the canary in his cage, Jerry trips the cat and Tom loses the canary. The cage rolls into the tree, jolting the canary and waking him up. The first thing he sees is the ongoing chase and he helps Jerry out by tangling Tom in the drying lines and sectioning him. Tom instead chases the canary with an axe, but misses and chops down a pole, which hits Tom on the head and comically nails Tom into the ground. As Jerry is being pursued, the canary motions for him to join him up in the birdhouse. Tom follows him up, but the canary gives him a 2,000-lb weight and Tom plummets. The two shake hands but the peace doesn't last long as Tom erects a ladder and starts to climb it. But before Tom can reach the top, the canary lights a match to it. Tom and the ladder are left burned and completely black. Tom now winds up a swing and manages to hang on to the birdhouse with his fingers, but the two allies crush them and Tom yells and lets go of the birdhouse. His head goes so low that it digs through the ground. Tom tries to segue polo to the birdhouse, but the canary provides a rollerskate and Tom is sent out of control into a nearby house. He is sent flying through a mountain dew and through the entire second floor. Tom comes out the other side hanging from the window in a girdle, which snaps and falls with him. Tom soon discovers, though, that the girdle makes a pair of wings. He delights in his new ability until he fails to spot a mailbox in his path.  Tom recovers and sets out to the roof of the house, jumps off and takes flight. Tom makes sure to pass by the window of the birdhouse so Jerry can see him. Jerry does spot him, but it takes a double take to realize what he's seeing. He lets out a gasp and wakes the canary to tell him. Jerry articulates what he's seen, but the canary laughs and goes back to sleep. Jerry finally gets his way, and the canary goes out to investigate. He sees Tom, and Tom flies after the canary, but ends up hitting a church bell. The canary and Jerry pull up the roof of their birdhouse and turn it upside down, exposing the nails which held it in place. Tom can't avoid the nails, and lands on his bottom on the nails. He then falls into a pond and gets out, only to find the holes in his bottom leaking water, which humorously, waters some nearby plants in a manner similar to a watering can. Jerry slides down the pole,all right salutes the canary, and walks away, but is soon overtaken by Tom. The canary unties Tom's wings and Tom falls 300 feet, falling through a tree and painfully slicing it in half because of his speed.

After being tipped out of bed and dressed using several mechanical contraptions, Wallace  is greeted with a large pile of bills. Wallace remembers Gromit\'s birthday and presents Gromit with a somewhat unwelcome gift of a spiked dog collar, and a second present of a pair of ex-NASA robotic "Techno Trousers", acquired by Wallace to alleviate the burden of taking Gromit for walks. While Gromit is out on a "walk", Wallace realises they are in financial difficulty and decides to let the spare bedroom out. He is answered by an inscrutable-looking penguin named Feathers McGraw, who comes to stay at the house, pushing Gromit out of his comfortable bedroom, winning Wallace\'s favour and taking interest in the Techno Trousers. Upset that Feathers has intruded on his relationship with his master, Gromit leaves home. After viewing his departure, Feathers gets to work on altering the Techno Trousers for his own means, removing the controls on the trousers and adapting them into a remote control. After sleeping rough, Gromit hunts for suitable lodgings, noticing a police notice for a criminal penguin who disguises himself as a chicken by wearing a rubber glove on his head . Meanwhile, Wallace\'s normal morning routine is interrupted by the replacement of his expected trousers with the modified Techno Trousers. Trapped inside the "wrong trousers", Wallace is marched out of the house and sent around town on an extended test run, unaware that Feathers is controlling them. Gromit witnesses this spectacle and later spies on Feathers as he suspiciously measures up the exterior of the city museum. He returns home and in his old bedroom, uncovers plans to steal a giant diamond from the museum, using the trousers and Wallace as tools. However, Gromit is too late to foil the plan and hides inside Wallace\'s bed, where he sees Feathers arrive dressed in his "chicken disguise", Gromit realising from the wanted poster that the penguin is a wanted thief. Wallace, in a deep sleep after the day\'s misadventures, is unwittingly brought into the robbery by Feathers and marched out of the house to the museum. Feathers uses the suction feet on the trousers to climb the wall, enter the building through an air vent and walk along the ceiling, avoiding the laser alarm system. The helmet Wallace is dressed in contains a remote-controlled claw which hooks the diamond. The diamond has barely been hooked  when a loose ceiling tile sets the trousers off balance, causing the claw to trigger the alarm, which wakes Wallace up. After marching Wallace out and back to West Wallaby Street, Feathers reveals his identity and traps Wallace in a wardrobe. As Feathers makes for the door with the diamond, Gromit confronts Feathers with a rolling pin. Feathers pulls out a revolver and forces Gromit into the wardrobe with Wallace, locking them both inside. Being an expert with electronics, Gromit manages to break into the trousers\' circuits to make them march and eventually break the wardrobe apart. There follows a fast chase aboard a train set, as Gromit attempts to stop Feathers escaping with the diamond. Wallace\'s attempts to aid are mostly unsuccessful, though he removes Feathers\' revolver and frees himself from the trousers. After Feathers\' train is abruptly stopped by the trousers, he is captured and handed in to the police station and imprisoned in a zoo. For catching Feathers, Wallace and Gromit are given their substantial reward, which pays off their debts. Meanwhile, the trousers, unceremoniously consigned to the dustbin, walk off by themselves into the sunset.'] ['Scrooge  is counting money in the counting house of his firm when Bob Cratchit  comes in, wanting to borrow a lump of coal as he is freezing.

Jerry and Nibbles enter the castle hall through a stained glass window, through a suit of armor, and by parachuting down to the table. They unsuspectingly catch Tom\'s attention by showering him with champagne. Later, Nibbles is helping himself to some of the food while singing Alouette to himself, when Tom emerges behind him and pokes him with his sword. The little mouse yells angrily. Before Nibbles can get away, Tom impales the little mouse\'s cape with his rapier. Jerry manages to stab Tom in the rear-end and rescue Nibbles.

Nibbles walks out of the drink, drunk, and pokes Tom in the bottom. Tom screams in pain and jumps up. Nibbles waves his sword while saying, "Touche, pussy cat!" but as he runs away Tom catches him. Jerry makes the save by hitting Tom on the head with a gada so much that Tom falls through the table, which leads into Tom and Jerry having a sword fight.

Tuffy is the only student at Jerry\'s school. However, Jerry is late. He is startled by the sound of Jerry being chased around the room outside the hole by Tom. Finally, Jerry reaches the hole, slamming the door shut behind him. He heaves a sigh of relief and straightens both his framed diploma on the wall and his necktie. Jerry begins teaching Tuffy the basics of outwitting a cat by way of a couple of cartoon strips on the chalkboard. The first one demonstrates how the cat chases the mouse and, if he catches the mouse, will eat him. Tuffy begins to cry. Jerry directs his attention to the other picture sequence, which shows the mouse reaching his hole and the cat saying "bad words." Tuffy laughs. For the next lesson, Jerry shows Tuffy an imitation cat\'s paw in front of a mousehole facade. He demonstrates the procedure and Tuffy goes into the hole, where he makes a show of looking for danger, walks straight out of the hole and ends up walking on the spot with his tail getting caught in the cat\'s paw. Jerry isn\'t pleased, so he has Tuffy work the cat\'s paw while he gives another demonstration. Tuffy winds the crank with such enthusiasm that Jerry can\'t get away and ends up flat on the floor like a carpet before the little mouse realises what he\'s doing. He looks under the paw and twinges with embarrassment, then rushes into the classroom and puts up a CLASS DISMISSED sign. However, as he is leaving the mousehole, he is caught by Jerry by the diaper. Tuffy immediately retreats to the stool in the corner and dons the dunce cap. Following a lesson book, the mice are hidden behind a sofa, as Jerry attempts to show Tuffy how to pluck a whisker from the cat without waking him up. Using the furniture and the rug as cover, he succeeds in obtaining one of Tom\'s whiskers  and makes it back to the sofa to show Tuffy. To Jerry\'s annoyance, Tuffy approaches Tom directly, instead of stealthily. His annoyance quickly turns to horror when his young charge returns not only with a whisker, but with a very bemused Tom still attached. Jerry grabs Tuffy and flees back to the hole. Tuffy reaches the hole first and slams the door in Jerry\'s face. Jerry frantically bangs for him to let him in. Tuffy finally opens the door again, but by then, Tom has beaten up Jerry, who tumbles in with a black eye and wearing the lesson book around his neck. Later on, Jerry demonstrates the next lesson in the  book: how to obtain cheese without waking the cat. Using the blinds as an elevator, a cup and spoon as a rowboat, and a broom as a slide, he succeeds in climbing onto the countertop and reaching a plate with some cheese on it, but narrowly avoids waking Tom when he drops his piece of cheese on his head. Acting quickly, he pulls Tom\'s eyes shut and soothes him back to sleep. Once back at the hole, Jerry shows his prize to Tuffy before eating it. The little mouse goes out himself and looks up at the plate of cheese on the countertop and then wakes Tom, who looks at him sleepily and helpfully gives him the cheese, too tired to begin a chase. Jerry is dumbfounded as Tuffy returns with the whole cheese, shows it off, and swallows the whole lot at once, causing his stomach to assume a large wedge shape. In a last effort, Jerry tries to teach Tuffy how to bell the cat. By now, Tom is waiting for him, but fakes being asleep. Playing along with Jerry as he ties on the bell, he even conveniently lifts his head up and puts a finger on the knot as Jerry ties it. Jerry signals his thanks before realising his folly and flees. Tom catches him easily, proceeds to beat him up again and Jerry later makes it back to the hole with the string and bell wound many times around his neck. Tuffy is holding a package wrapped as a present. Tuffy looks out nervously and gulps. He cautiously approaches Tom, who is now fully awake and grumpy and offers him the present. Tom opens it and finds it to be a bell on a string. Delighted at the gift, he gestures to Tuffy, asking if it is really for him. Tuffy smiles and nods repeatedly. Tom puts the bell on himself and thanks Tuffy by gently patting him on the head. Jerry, having ultimately failed, storms off in disgust and throws his diploma in the trash. At the end of the cartoon, Tuffy is teaching the class. He points to the board, which reads, "Cats And Mice Should Be Friends." Jerry, who is now the pupil and wearing the dunce cap, angrily shakes his head. Tom is ringing his bell and sitting next to Jerry. By contrast, Tom nods his head enthusiastically at the idea. He removes Jerry\'s dunce cap and kisses his head much to Jerry\'s chagrin.'] ['This is an advertising film for Solidox toothpaste.

It then moves on to an image of the stream running through the village of Cwmgiedd , and an eight-minute opening sequence interspersed with images and sounds of everyday life in a community in the Upper Swansea Valley; men are shown working at the colliery, women engaged in domestic tasks in their homes and the inhabitants singing in the Methodist chapel. Most of the dialogue in this section is spoken in Welsh, with no subtitles provided. The section closes with another title card stating "such is life at Cwmgiedd...and such too was life in Lidice until the coming of Fascism". The German occupation is heralded by the arrival in the village of a black car, blaring military music and political slogans from its loudhailer. Little is shown of the occupation itself, its violence being implied by a soundtrack of marching boots, gunfire and harshly amplified orders and directives, in the sound-as-narrative technique Jennings had previously developed in Listen to Britain. The identity of the community is eroded, with the Welsh language being suppressed and no longer permitted as the teaching medium in the school, and trade union activity being made illegal. The villagers resistance takes the form of covert activities including the publication of a Welsh news sheet. Eventually, even the singing of Welsh hymns in the chapel is outlawed. The murder of Reinhard Heydrich, whose assassination  by British-trained Czech agents in Prague sparked the actual Lidice massacre, is the catalyst for the systematic obliteration of Cwmgiedd in reprisal. The children of the village are marched out of school and join the womenfolk as they are loaded onto trucks. The men, defiantly singing "Land of Our Fathers" as they go, are lined up against the wall of the village churchyard.'] ['By means of five 5 minute films, About Sudan submerges us in some of the most deeply rooted activities in daily life.

While all this is taking place, down below the stage, Jerry is trying to sleep, but is awakened by Tom\'s operatic tones. Jerry attempts to halt Tom\'s singing by bumping the floor with a toothbrush, but Tom stomps on the floor, sending Jerry bouncing around. Jerry hits a floorboard with a hammer, causing Tom to be launched into the air and to excuse himself. Next, Tom sings again, this time, stomping the floor while performing. Creating a huge rumble in Jerry\'s house, more harder than before, when Tom stomps really intense, Jerry\'s bed snap to pieces and Jerry thinks it\'s war and decides to get revenge. Tom continues the performance and Jerry holds up a sign through the vent that has written on it "PSST!" Tom sings as he peeks through and Jerry ties his mouth shut. Tom in retaliation shoots a staple into the vent, which scoops up Jerry and pins him to a wall of the basement. Jerry makes an annoyed expression. Jerry licks a lemon so Tom gets sour by the scent and taste, Tom is sweating, gets sour and his lips shrink and then frustrated goes to Jerry. While singing, he twists a Lemon on Jerry. Tom returns to the spotlight and Jerry drills a hole in the floor and pulls Tom\'s front garments off with a wire. Tom pulls the wire up and down and wrenches it from Jerry\'s grip. While Tom is singing the "Figaro!" part, Jerry aims a plunger at Tom\'s mouth and scores a direct hit. Jerry imitates Tom and is stuck with the plunger.

Finally, while Mickey and Donald are standing on a log, Pete turns on a circular saw positioned to cut the log. Mickey and Donald run to stay ahead of the blade, but eventually the end of the log comes and the saw blade shakes loose and spins out of control.

Hormel had cut the hourly wage from $10.69 to $8.25 and cut benefits by 30 percent despite posting a net profit of $30 million. The local union  opposed the cut, but the national union, the United Food and Commercial Workers, disagrees with their strategy. The local union is shown hiring a freelance strike consultant, Ray Rogers, who comes in with charts, graphs and promises of a corporate campaign to draw national press attention. Rogers delivers in the short term, but, it is not enough to defeat opposition from Hormel management and the UFCW international union. Soon, despite the efforts of a seasoned negotiator sent by the parent union, the company has locked out the workers and hired replacement workers, leading to a series of violent conflicts amongst members of the community. The workers' resolve progressively fades as the battle extends into months and years, and the financial hardships they and their families suffer leads some to doubt the value of their efforts. Kopple, who had previously covered an extended miner's strike in the acclaimed 1977 documentary Harlan County, USA, focuses on the personalities and emotions behind the strike, creating a highly charged portrait of labor that is sympathetic to the workers' distress without ignoring the strike's greater ambiguities. American Dream features footage of union meetings and press releases, Hormel press releases, news broadcasts, and in-depth interviews with people on both sides of the issue, including Jesse Jackson."] ['{{Plot}} Elmer Fudd is hunting for Bugs Bunny using his "Wabbit Detector".

Jerry, who is sleeping inside the piano, is rudely awakened by the hammers, then sits on top of the piano to mock the cat by "conducting" him. Tom flicks Jerry off the piano. Tom continues playing without any interruptions. Jerry arises from under one of the keys. Tom plays tremolo on this key, knocking Jerry on the head, and then Jerry runs back and forth underneath. Tom smashes the mouse under the keys, plays the main theme of the rhapsody, and when Tom lifts his two fingers from playing a trill, the piano continues playing. He looks over the edge of the piano and spots Jerry playing the felts from inside. To quiet him, he whacks Jerry with a tuning tool. Jerry retaliates by slamming the piano lid onto Tom\'s fingers. Tom still plays, and then Jerry pops out on the far right of the piano to attempt to cut Tom\'s finger with a pair of scissors as he plays a note from the very highest minor third of the piano. After the sixth miss, Jerry pants from this effort, and then substitutes a mousetrap for the white keys just below it. Tom plays the keys on either side for a few seconds but eventually, Tom\'s finger gets caught in the trap. Jerry prances up and down on the piano, upon which Tom climbs and proceeds to play with his feet. As Tom gets back down to play with his fingers, Jerry dances around on the felts, momentarily changing the tune from the rhapsody to "On the Atchison, Topeka, and the Santa Fe". Tom then plays a chord where the mouse is standing repeatedly, receiving increasingly rude gestures in return, and eventually catches the mouse and stows him into the piano stool. Jerry then crawls out of an opening and manipulates the seat\'s controls, cranking it up, and sending it crashing down. Tom stuffs Jerry into the felts and then goes crazy on the piano. The felts take on a life of their own, bashing Jerry about, spanking him, and squashing him to and fro. Eventually, Jerry gets squashed and comes out, very angry about this, and then breaks off some felts and plays the finale of the rhapsody in one last retaliation. Jerry constantly increases the speed of his playing, plays two false endings, and generally taunts him, such that Tom is left with raggedy clothes and collapses at the end of the tune.

Coyote, labeled "Eatius-slobbius" . Eventually, the chase leads to a 3-way Y fork, leaving the coyote confused as to which way his enemy went. The bird answers for him by pulling up behind him and beeping, giving the coyote a real headache on the rocks above. However, before he can chase the Road Runner in that direction, the bird pulls behind him a second time. Wile instantly suspects the situation, and peeks through his legs, but this only leads to him bumping his head on the ground when the Road Runner beeps. The chase now begins in full force, ending when the Road Runner barely escapes the coyote\'s grip and sets a bridge on fire due to his speed. Wile does his best to slow down when he sees the upcoming hole left in it, but fails and falls down to the ground. After hitting the ground, Wile E. comes up with an idea or 2 on how to catch the Road Runner: 1. While the Road Runner is munching on desert plants, his opponent attempts to drop a hand grenade on him. However, the grenade, by pure misfortune, drops onto a power line and is hoisted directly back to its owner, instantly wiping the laugh off his face. The grenade explodes, and the coyote lets go of the stop perforce. This, however, causes a second grenade to be thrown up to Wile and explode on him as well. Later on, Wile paces the cliff he\'s still on and it isn\'t until he stops near the edge that he comes up with a new plan. 2. Wile E. starts his painful trapeze act and ends up getting scraped on the ground, hitting the top of a tunnel and hit by the face by an ACME truck. 3. Hoping to ambush the Road Runner, Wile E. loads a firework into a slingshot and prepares to fire it at the Road Runner, but it explodes on him first. 4. Having mined the road with a giant firework, the coyote has logistical problems with the match. His first attempts has the match burn his face. Finally he is "gratefully" helped out by the Road Runner, who gives the coyote a lit match. As soon as Wile lights the fuse, the Road Runner disappears, causing the coyote to chase after him. The Road Runner then stops next to the firework, signals for the coyote to stop, and points at the sizzling firework before he dodges the explosion, leaving Wile to take the entire blast. 5. To hopefully squash the Road Runner, the coyote flips a rock across a high outcropping, rather predictably leading to the entire outcropping breaking off. Wile continues to flip the rock over, and it is only when the rock ends up in the air above him that he realizes what is happening. He runs through the air to avoid being squashed directly by the rock, and the piece of outcropping lands on a rock to create a see-saw. Wile E. lands on the right end, while the rock smashes onto the left end and sends the coyote up into a rockface, then down onto the see-saw again before he flips the rock onto himself. 6. With his own special steamboat, it looks good for Wile E. Coyote, tearing apart the river as he attempts to catch the Road Runner on the riverbank. However, when he climbs out to attempt to grab his opponent, he sees that he is going over a waterfall and only barely steers himself back in the other direction. With relief, the coyote relaxes until he ends up falling off a second waterfall in the opposite direction! 7. With stealth exhausted, the coyote tries to use raw speed to catch the Road Runner and tests his new high-speed tonic  on an unsuspecting mouse. The mouse rattles around as a "warm-up", then darts across the desert at an impossible speed, and runs up and down a rock arch to return to his tester. Happy with this development, Wile E. releases the mouse, still suffering the effects of RPM, into his hole, and then drinks the entire bottle of it himself. After the warm-up period, Wile begins the chase and quickly begins to erase the Road Runner\'s considerable head start. However, just as it is getting down to the wire, the Road Runner sidesteps and trips the coyote, making him roll out of control into a construction zone and then into a dynamite shed, along with a kerosene lamp, which explodes everything inside. The small silo top is transformed into a rocket, which is fired into the sky along with its rider and explodes, creating fireworks in the starry night sky, much to Road Runner\'s amusement.'] ['The film takes place in what has been described as the Rawlsian2081 - About the Film Finallyequal.com retrieved 2008-08-19 Following closely with Vonnegut\'s original story, 2081 begins with George and Hazel Bergeron — parents of the exceptionally strong, intelligent, handsome Harrison Bergeron — sitting in their living room, watching the ballet on television. George carries many "handicaps", wearing an earpiece and heavy weights to counteract his intelligence and strength, respectively. Hazel, being perfectly average and capable of only carrying thoughts in "short bursts", wears none. Six years prior, Harrison was taken in a raid on their home by a SWAT team from the office of the Handicapper General. Sitting in his sofa, George tries to think about the event, but can\'t quite bring himself to recall exactly what happened in between the painful intermittent bursts sent through his earpiece. He continues to watch the ballet instead. The ballet is interrupted by a government news report being read by a news anchor with a severe speech impediment about the escaped fugitive Harrison Bergeron. George watches the report with a hint of interest. The report concludes and returns to the regularly scheduled ballet, featuring delicate ballerinas heavily weighed down to ensure that they are only as graceful as the average person. Just then, loud stomps can be heard approaching the stage, as the ballerinas cower in terror. Harrison Bergeron marches down the aisle and leaps onto the stage with a heavy thud, almost unhindered by the weight of his massive handicaps. In a deviation from Vonnegut\'s story, he begins his address to the audience in the theater and those watching at home by claiming to have a bomb under the stage, the detonator to which he holds in his hand. The audience listens to his address in shock as he peels of his handicaps and chooses a volunteer ballerina to do the same. He takes her hand, and for a few brief moments, the two dance, unhindered, as the audience watches, mystified by the pair\'s unbridled grace and elegance. The enforcers of the Handicapper General, keen to keep this display under wraps, surround the theater and quickly cut the video feed to the television audience as the Handicapper General herself marches down the aisle with a shotgun. On cue, Harrison pushes the button of his "detonator", which rather than detonating the dummy bomb under the stage, sends a signal to a device that overrides the video block, reminiscent of John Galt’s broadcast in Ayn Rand’s Atlas Shrugged.<ref nameCline|first"2081": Philosophy in Motion|url30 July 2012}} He looks into the camera with a proud but slightly somber grin. George smiles back at the television. Unaware that the video feed is again being broadcasted, the Handicapper General fires the shotgun, killing Harrison and his ballerina. The SWAT team leader, having been unable to stop her before she fired, informs her of their mistake. In surprise and embarrassment, she looks around in realization that this gruesome, atrocious act of oppression has been broadcasted for all to see. George stares heartbrokenly into the television as the signal is again blocked, until his train of thought is again broken by the screeching of his headset; true to Vonnegut\'s telling of the story, the gravity of the moment is lost on them, and they slip back into normalcy.'] ["Snubbed by his girlfriend Darla, Alfalfa accepts the invitation of tomboyish Muggsy to attend the local picture show.

Bugs, in the middle of his morning workout , eventually sees the letter and assumes it\'s for him. On reading the letter, he gets shocked: "Holy cats, I\'ve been drafted!" Bugs\' going through the Army induction center only causes some small reactions: -After asking a guard for directions, the guard assumes the Army has started inducting rabbits. -Before Bugs has his x-rays taken, a tall, rather lanky, tiny-headed person behind him looks at him and in response looks and chuckles at the audience. -When Bugs has his sx-rays taken, the doctor there assumes he\'s  been overworked. -Bugs also passes the eye exam with flying colors from the first letter right down to the microscopic "Reg.

Before going, she remembers to feed Sharky  and gives him a bone. Soon after, Granny leaves and Tweety begins singing "Her name was Hula Lou" on his guitar. On the main island, Sylvester wanders around the beach looking for something to eat, but only finds fish skeletons and moans how he\'ll starve if he doesn\'t find any good food. Upon hearing Tweety\'s singing, Sylvester suspects his prayers have been answered and starts paddling to Granny\'s island in a rubber life raft. However, Tweety spots Sylvester approaching and orders Sharky to stop him. Sharky swims out and takes a bite of the life raft, only to inflate from it, but it\'s enough to scare Sylvester into rowing away.

Tom flips the picnic basket\'s cover and, by crashing on his head, it\'s force silences Jerry, who exacts his revenge by untying the anchor of Tom\'s waist.

After closing time, Bugs retires to have a well-earned carrot. The store manager appears and informs Bugs that since the summer sale\'s over, he\'s being transferred to another department, which Bugs puzzles over  The man tells the rabbit he will look splendid... after he has been "stuffed". Right after Bugs does what he thinks could be a suitable pose, he ponders this for a second, finds out that the manager intends to cut him open to be "stuffed," screams after realizing this, and begins a cartoon-long chase. The manager then chases Bugs into the jewelry department with a gun and fires when he catches sight of Bugs\' ears sticking up from a counter. Bugs moves his ears so the bullets miss, but seems to raise his hands in surrender. Just as the manager gloats that he\'ll finish Bugs off, Bugs pops out from behind the counter , armed with a gun as well, and states he\'ll finish off the manager. He pulls the trigger, to which the gun sticks out three "bang" signs, prompting the manager to stick three "ouch" signs out of his mouth. At one point, when the manager gloats that he outsmarted Bugs, Bugs distracts him by telling him he sounds "just like that guy on the radio: The Great Gildersneeze!" Bugs is right, the voice is a good imitation of Harold Peary\'s character in the The Great Gildersleeve. The actor providing that voice here is uncredited, although most animation historians seem to agree it was Dick Nelson.  Just as the manager is gushing over this comment, Bugs swipes the gun away, making it go off in the process. When the manager demands to know if Bugs had been attempting to outsmart him, Bugs innocently states that he just did and gives the manager a wacky kiss on the nose. The manager then chases after Bugs into the ladies\' department, where he sees a customer . Bugs asks for a pair of bedroom slippers, to which the gushy manager takes off Bugs\' high heel and tickles his feet.

He is first seen making simple constructs out of detritus&nbsp;– a swinging armature of scrap metal, an upright book with string tied around it, and a dummy rag doll full of tar, though the purpose behind these things is unclear at first. Hunting 9 relentlessly is the Cat Beast, a mechanical monster wearing a cat's skull for a head. It appears to be guided by a small glowing talisman which it holds in its claws. Sitting quietly, 9 stares into the mirrored surface of his own strange talisman and has a flashback… Once he searched the ruins with his mentor 5, a one-eyed rag doll. They gathered useful bits and pieces and stored them in the cloth linings of their own skin. With 9's help, 5 was able to salvage a light bulb and operate it using pieces of wire. 5 gave the functional bulb to 9 for safe-keeping. Almost immediately after, 5 drew the mirrored talisman from inside his chest. It glowed green, warning of danger. 5 gave the talisman to 9 then pushed him into cover. Extending a homemade folding spear, 5 stepped out to confront the threat. But the Cat Beast circled behind him and snatched him up with a metal pincer, shearing off his right arm. Though he struggled, 5 could not break free, and the Cat Beast sucked 5's soul out through his mouth using its talisman leaving 5 lifeless. Horrified, 9 escaped in panic, almost giving away his location to the Cat Beast by scraping the light bulb against a rock. 9 is woken from the memory by the warning green glow of the mirrored talisman. Taking the light bulb, which he has attached to the end of a staff, 9 flees into a ruined house. The Cat Beast follows and we see that it has not just taken the other rag dolls' souls: it also wears their numbered skins like a garment. The number 5 shows prominently on its back. The Beast pounces on what it thinks is 9, but which turns out to be a marionette&nbsp;– the dummy created by 9 at the beginning of the film. The Beast's claws stick in the tar and 9 is able to hop onto its back and steal the Beast's talisman. 9 leads the Beast on a panicked chase through the house and finally runs out onto the end of a broken plank, which extends over a several-story drop. Thinking it has 9 at bay, the Beast walks out onto the plank. But it has fallen into 9's trap. Nearby is the metal armature, and the upright book. 9 leaps off the plank onto the armature, which swings him around to the book. He kicks it and it falls into the pit. The string, tied at one end to the book, has its other end tied to the plank. The weight of the falling book drags the plank into the pit, and the Beast with it. The Beast crashes through a hole in the cellar floor and is presumably impaled by the sharp end of the falling plank. This all reveals that all the things that 9 has built was a cleverly made trap for the Beast. Now free from fear, 9 salvages the skins of the other rag dolls and prepares them to be ceremonially burned. As he looks sadly at the skin of 5, the two talismans begin to glow. 9 realizes that they are two halves of a whole and puts them together. A beam of green light erupts from the united talisman, and the spirits of the eight slain rag dolls 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 emerge, returning to their rag doll skins to be at peace. Before disappearing, 5's soul turns to 9 and nods in approval. In the morning, when the ashes have cooled, 9&nbsp;– bearing the light bulb staff, a symbol of the persistent light of knowledge and learning&nbsp;– walks off into the wasteland, leaving the empty talisman behind in the sand."] ['Wealthy Mrs. Pennington Van Renssalaer, upon hearing of a rival socialite\'s gathering of "settlement children" for a "lawn fete", decides to conduct a similar picnic of her own.

Coyote pointing at the words and then himself. The Road Runner then pulls up behind him and beeps, sending the Coyote into the air. The Road Runner\'s name is shown  before he moves off stage, leaving a dust cloud for Wile E. to land in. The chase starts, and the Coyote slowly gains on his opponent until the Road Runner dodges off the road, leaving Wile E. at the mercy of an approaching bus. The Coyote kicks up a pothole and turns the other way, successfully outrunning the bus. However, as he taunts the bus, he runs directly off a cliff. As Wile E. hurtles towards the left, he pokes his tongue back in and points worriedly at the void below him. Then, he slams into a mountainside and soon suffers gravity. The Road Runner pulls up to the top of the mountain that Wile E. ran into and beeps to get the coyote\'s attention. Fueled by rage, the Coyote climbs the mountain, but soon falls back down. His second climb causes the entire edge of the mountain to fall as the Coyote scrambles to the top. Wile E. climbs to the top of the precipice and prepares to chase the Road Runner, but eventually realizes he\'s on his way down. He can only wince in puzzlement before hitting the ground a third time. 1. A simple plan - simply loading himself into a bow - leads to a simple denouement: running into the wood instead of going towards the bird. 2. Rather than face the Road Runner directly, Wile E. uses a grenade mounted on top of a model airplane to take out the Road Runner from above. However, when he sets the propeller in motion, only the propeller flies into the air. The Coyote soon figures out the situation and throws the entire model airplane into the air, but the grenade still remains in the air, spinning behind the surprised Coyote before exploding. 3. Returning to simplicity, Wile E. uses a wedge to throw a large rock, but it results in self-squashing. 4. This time, Wile E. lays out iron pellets covered with bird seed for the Road Runner to eat, while lying in wait on a high cliff with a magnet on a fishing line. However, the magnet attaches itself to a power line, electrocuting the Coyote - twice - and causing his nose to flash like a light bulb. The Coyote unscrews his nose and gazes at its flashing, looking amused. 5. The Coyote then attempts to load a cannon, but as he pounds in the cannonball with a stick, the cannon fires the two items out of it, with the Coyote still hanging on to the stick. Gravity results, and Wile E. and the stick land into the ground, to be pounded down by the cannonball. 6. Wile E. now lies in wait on top of a cliff with another, but much larger cannon as the Road Runner munches on more birdseed. The Coyote turns the cannon downwards as he goes to light the fuse, but the cannon falls off its mount, taking the Coyote down with it. He runs himself off to the right and finds the cannon facing him. Wile E. gropes downwards to escape the cannon\'s fire, but the cannon faces him again, but is now hovering right over his head. Wile E. sighs and soon realizes the inevitable, and is then swallowed by the cannon. The Road Runner moves out of the way as the cannon  hits the ground. Then the cannon fires, sending it back up to its mount, which also causes the precipice to break and to fall back down on the Coyote. 7. Hoping to out-corner his rival, Wile E. greases his feet with axle grease and glides across the mountaintop, but soon sees the edge of the cliff. With no alternative, he grabs onto a saguaro and gets speared by its spines and he cries out in pain. Now, he can spot the Road Runner\'s trajectory and leaps off down the mountain slope, but instead of stopping in the middle of the road, he continues down the mountain and drops off it, and then onto the power lines seen earlier. Wile E. surfs these with no way to stop himself, but when he reaches the ground, he moves directly onto a railroad track, complete with an approaching train! Fortunately, before it hits the Coyote, he moves onto a side track. Wile E. points happily at the receding train, but now sees he\'s going into a tunnel with another train coming out of it. Wile E. strokes himself against the wind, barely keeping pace, and then the camera pans up to show the train is labeled: "NEW YORK EXPRESS / NON STOP". The camera cuts up again to the Road Runner in the conductor\'s compartment, apparently enjoying the prospect of chasing his opponent 2,500&nbsp;miles across the United States.'] ['Betty and Bimbo take a trip to Crazytown for a small vacation where anything can happen. mice are roaring & birds swim in the lake.

In turn, the biggest squirrel bullies the middle one, "Who\'s gonna be Robin Hood?" "You\'re gonna be Robin Hood!". That decided, the Robin Hood squirrel names the middle squirrel as Little John, leaving the grumbling smallest squirrel to play the unwanted role of the rich old villain. The "villain" then trudges off to await the inevitable song-and-dance attack of Robin Hood and Little John, while a fox, lurking on the side, sees them as his dinner and devises a ruse through which he pipes up, in a falsetto voice, claiming to be Robin\'s sweetheart Maid Marian in trouble. Robin and Little John follow the bait into the fox\'s cabin, whereupon the fox drops his pretense and his falsetto and hangs the two up by their breeches on the wall, declaring his intention to make a stew out of them. The smallest squirrel, looking in from the outside of the cabin, devises a plan to save his friends. By means of voice imitations and sound effects, he makes the fox believe that hunters are after him. After he literally turns yellow and panics, in fear of his life, he runs away at maximum speed, beating the cabin door which accompanies him upright on his flight from reality. Thus rescued, the two exit the cabin, only to be greeted by the smallest squirrel, who asks them with a grin, "Who\'s gonna be Robin Hood?"'] ["A woman sees someone on the street as she is walking back to her home.

A giant, u-shaped magnet connected to the telescope is pointed at a comet and turned on, drawing the comet towards the observers. Something goes wrong, however, and the comet crashes into the town, rolls through the streets, and then tumbles into the ocean nearby. Newspapers the next day report the disaster, and the police are shown arguing with the scientist, who claims the importance of his work is worth the risk of human lives. The police say, as Lois looks on, that they will stop any attempt to try the experiment again, but the scientist refuses to quit, reminding them that any attempt to stop him could prove disastrous. He runs into his telescope room and shuts the door before the police can stop him, and begins his experiment again. Just as the magnet pulls the comet into earth\'s gravitational pull, the police jam a piece of metal into the electric generator running his machine and cut its main wires with axes. The comet, now out of the scientist\'s control, hurtles towards the town in a bright circle of light. As the police and scientist flee, Lois calls the Daily Planet from the scientist\'s building, reporting the impending disaster as the building crumbles around her and pins her. Clark happens to be standing nearby, and takes a cab to get to the telescope. As he nears the building, pieces of the comet destroy the road in front of them, the cabby flees, and Clark takes the opportunity to change clothes in the back of the car, becoming Superman. Superman saves Lois from the rubble of comet-shards, and then streaks towards the hurtling comet, striking it full-force, but he bounces off, seemingly having no effect on the comet\'s speed at all. While Superman lies unconscious, more comet-shards crush buildings, cars and trains across the town. Superman awakes and flies at the comet again, only to bounce off again, falling into the telescope\'s generator room. He notices the metal bar in it and removes it, then winds some cable around its rod and pulls, sending the generator into motion. He then completes the circuit to the scope by grabbing both ends of the cut wire and allowing the electric current to run through his chest from arm to arm. Lois sets the machine to reverse, and the comet is sent back into space just in time. We then see "Superman\'s" silhouette in the telescope control room, and Lois kisses him, only to find out that it is Clark.'] ["Nearing the end of a solo self-promotional cross-country road trip from New York to San Francisco, Windy Riley ends up in Hollywood by mistake due to an inadvertently turned-around sign.

Jerry removes the tack with a hammer after hearing the dog\'s pained cries, and as a reward, Spike becomes Jerry\'s protector, providing him with a bell to ring whenever he is in trouble. Jerry walks away, carefree and pleased with his good deed. Tom sees a good opportunity to catch his unaware rival and hides until Jerry walks around the corner, catching the mouse by surprise. After snatching up Jerry, Tom becomes curious as to what the bell could be for and rings it. Spike drops right on top of him and throws him onto the concrete twice, then picks him up onto his back and prepares one last move, spins around and slams the cat to the concrete, who breaks apart and reforms in the space of a second. Spike returns the bell to Jerry and skips away, but not without being seen by Tom. Making the connection, the cat tries an alternative by covering the mouse with a flowerpot such that he cannot ring the bell; unfortunately for Tom, there is a hole in the bottom, which the mouse sticks the ringing bell out of. Spike\'s fist extends itself from clear across the block and knocks Tom into a gumball machine, which then falls back onto the cat such that gumballs roll out of his head. Eventually, under pain of canine catastrophe, Tom is forced to become Jerry\'s "slave" around the house. Tom sets out five trays of cheese for Jerry, and while the mouse sniffs one, Tom attempts to filch the bell. Jerry thwarts him and eats a big wedge of cheese, causing himself to expand to the size of the wedge. Meanwhile, Tom reads the daily paper and is delighted to notice this headline: LEASH LAW PASSED: Public safety puts dogs on leash. Pleased with his freedom from both mouse and dog, Tom jaunts outside with the paper and \'tsk\'s at the dog while pulling at his leash. Tom measures the leash\'s length, draws a line in the grass, and slaps the dog with the paper. Spike attempts to bite at Tom repeatedly, but the leash barely restrains the dog. Tom pies Spike, smashes his head between cymbals, and punches him with a boxing glove, and then lets the dog\'s chomping teeth turn a log into a baseball bat. At his leisure, Tom knocks the dog out with it and then uses it as a pool cue to shoot Spike back into his doghouse. Tom returns, ecstatic, to Jerry and bops him on the head, and when the mouse rings his bell, no response is heard. Tom slaps him again and offers the mouse four other bells as further embarrassment. When these fail to work, Jerry realizes the truth and flees with his small bell. Tom corners him and beats him silly to the point that Jerry swallows the bell. Jerry runs to Spike\'s doghouse and rings himself, pleading for help. Spike, with sad eyes, presents his leash. Tom takes a break from chasing Jerry to tantalize Spike again, and holds out a lead pipe as Spike angrily tries to bite the cat again. All the dog\'s teeth fall out, and Tom nonchalantly sweeps them back up and returns them. Picking up on the pattern, Spike angrily rubs out the line, draws a new one in a spot he can reach and plops back down innocently. Tom chases Jerry both ways and stops to torment Spike again, but Spike lands directly on the cat this time. Realizing he\'s been tricked, the feline leaps out of his skin! Before Spike can process this information, Tom steals his skin back and escapes into a croquet field. Jerry runs through the field until he sees Tom, but cannot avoid being pelted by Tom\'s mallet. As Jerry hits the starting post, the bell is expelled from his stomach; Tom catches both the mouse and the bell and continuously rings the bell as the cartoon fades to a new scene. Tom has now pressed Jerry into servitude, using the bell as his signal. Jerry brings Tom\'s tray of food to him and falls under its weight. While Tom gobbles a turkey leg, Jerry reads the paper which shows the leash law\'s reversal: LEASH LAW LIFTED: Happy hounds hail freedom. Ecstatic, Jerry hits Tom with the newspaper, causing Tom\'s turkey to be lodged in his throat. Before the cat can capture him, Jerry rings his bell, and nothing happens for the moment. Tom, still believing the dog to be tied up based on Spike\'s non-appearance, rings the bell and bops Jerry alternately. Spike, carrying a newspaper himself, sneaks behind Tom and slams him over the head. Clueless, Tom rings the bell and is slapped again. Tom then rings a third time and ducks the newspaper swing, then peeks behind him and briefly sees Spike; the dog hits the cat a third time, cordially returns the bell to Jerry and then engages Tom in a brutal fight. After the brawl, Jerry and Spike are strolling down the street, with Tom inside a dog\'s leash and collar. Spike kicks Tom whenever Jerry rings his bell.'] ['Sam, an eight-year-old attending a Catholic school, and his trouble making friend Jacob prepare for their first confession. Their class is given a list of sins that children can confess. These include “bullying” and “swearing” among others. Sam pores over the list but is unable to come up with a sin he has done. Sam asks Jacob what he will confess. Jacob states that he would mention not listening to his mom and locking his sister in the closet. Sam feels like he will not be a true Catholic if he cannot be absolved, so he turns to Jacob to suggest a sin Sam could commit and then confess to. Jacob and Sam decide to steal Farmer Collins’ Scarecrow and leave in middle of the road for him to find while he is driving his tractor to town, committing the sin of “stealing.” The plan backfires when Famer Collins pulls off the main road before he sees the stolen scarecrow.

He is haunted by what he has done. In school the next day Sam runs out of his class into the bathroom, unable to deal with what he has done. Jacob runs after him and tells him that no one knows that he has to keep it together. Jacob tells Sam to meet him at the tree where they hid the scarecrow after dinner. During dinner that night Sam’s father mentions that Collins’ scarecrow was missing, leading guilt striven Sam to believe that his father knows what he has done. After dinner he meets Jacob by the tree. Sam wants to tell someone what has happened. Jacob states that if he does Jacob will deny everything because it was Sam’s fault. The two boys start pushing each other, while Sam yells over and over again “it’s not my fault, it’s not my fault.” During the fight Sam accidentally pushes Jacob into the same cliff they dumped the scarecrow the day before. Jacob dies instantly. The next day Sam goes to church early in the morning in his robes to have his first confession. While the Priest states that confession does start until later, Sam insists that he confess his sins now. The Priest, seeing that something is clearly troubling Sam, agrees. Sam states “Bless me father for I have sinned, this is my first confession.” The Priest gently asks Sam to name his sins. With tears streaming down his face Sam, unable to say all he has done, confesses not listening to his mum and locking his sister in the closet, the same sins his now deceased friend Jacob was going to confess. The Priest declares Sam’s sins to be absolved. The scene changes to the empty cross in the field and then fades to black.'] ["Hearing a strange voice, Alata finds a mysterious girl and offers to help her find what she is looking for.

While walking downhill, Oswald was being chased by a boulder. His efforts to outrun the large rock were in vain as it rammed him flat against a tree. In an attempt to restore his normal shape, Oswald dropped a smaller rock on top of him. This resulted in him having a more spherical physique, making it difficult for him to walk.

Quacker asks if Tom wants to eat him but Tom runs off as quickly as he can, clawing straight through a brick wall in order to escape. This convinced Quacker once and for all "Oh, boy, am I ugly...", and Quacker is at his lowest ebb, curbing his suicidal tendencies and reducing himself to hiding under a paper bag , and saying that he\'ll never show his face again. A female duckling passes by and sees Quacker sitting in despair on a rock. In curiosity she tries to look at his face, and giggles at his reaction before declaring he is cute. Quacker, no longer thinking himself ugly, tosses the bag away, then clicks his heels for joy and happily takes her arm. Jerry quickly looks on, the two ducklings waddle off together into the sunset, stopping along the way to share a kiss and continue to walk to the sunset.'] ["A young boy, Bambino, goes on a midnight sailing trip with his father Papà and grandfather Nonno. After they anchor their boat in the middle of the sea, Papà presents Bambino with a cap similar to the ones he and Nonno wear. The two men disagree on how Bambino should wear it, with Papà pulling it low over his eyes and Nonno pushing it back on his head. Papà sets up a long ladder for Bambino to climb so he can set the boat's anchor on the full moon, and the three ascend to start their work of sweeping fallen stars off the lunar surface. Papà urges Bambino to use a pushbroom on the stars, while Nonno favors a besom broom. As they quarrel, a huge star crashes down on the moon; it is far too large for any of them to move by themselves. Turning his cap backwards, the way he wants to wear it, Bambino climbs onto the star and taps it with a hammer. It bursts apart into hundreds of smaller stars, and all three go to work sweeping them up, with Bambino choosing a rake instead of either man's broom. Once the job is done, they climb back down into their boat and look up at the moon, which now displays a glowing crescent phase thanks to their efforts."] ['Photographers leave the deck of a riverboat in large numbers.

A highway is in the background and immediately after Bugs retires Elmer Fudd drives up because he has seen a rare desert flower next to Bugs\' hole that he wants to put in his tropical garden. Elmer does not notice the rabbit hole and is unaware of Bugs\' presence, but he is careful when digging up the flower to include lots of room so that the flower can "prosper in its native soil". Elmer does not realize is that he has unknowingly taken Bugs as well as the flower back to his penthouse apartment. The next scene has Bugs emerging from the hole still half-asleep. He obliviously goes into Elmer\'s penthouse thinking he is headed to his "bathing stream", which instead is a large Roman-styled bathroom with an indoor pool in the middle. Bugs gets into the pool and realizes that he is not in his stream but thinks his surroundings are a mirage so he plays along by splashing around and singing "There\'s no place like home" but instead substituting Rome for home. Bugs then sings the word "yearn" but, sensing that he might be signing out of tune, gets out of the pool and goes into the next room, where he plays and note on a piano and sings "yearn, fa la yearn" until he is in tune. Elmer sees Bugs go back into the "bathroom" and wonders why Bugs is there. Elmer then gets a shotgun and fires several shots into the pool. Bugs submerges under the water as if he has been killed but then hops out and sneaks behind Elmer, whispering into his ear: "You better plug him again, Mac, just to be sure." Elmer then inserts the barrel of the shotgun into the water and shoots, which results in him blowing a hole in the floor which causes the water to spill into the apartment underneath him. Then a knock is heard on Elmer\'s door and it is his downstairs neighbor, who is twice Elmer\'s size and soaking wet. The neighbor grabs the shotgun and ties the barrel around Elmer\'s head, then fires the gun before leaving. Bugs then is seen in the patio area of the penthouse when Elmer tries to shoot him, but constantly misses. Bugs then asks if Elmer is trying to get rid of him and, when Elmer says that "rabbits don\'t belong in penthouses" accuses Elmer of thinking he is "better" than a rabbit and if Elmer can prove that he is better, Bugs will leave. Elmer accepts the challenge and Bugs fashions several contests around the penthouse that Elmer wins, but not before suffering large consequences. The first two events are a strength test and then a shooting test, both of which Bugs loses. He then says that there is one more event, the "jump test". Bugs fails his test, which involves jumping over an outdoor bench, and then sets up the bench for Elmer. However, Bugs positions the bench vertically and near the overlook of the penthouse so that when Elmer jumps over it, he is actually jumping off the edge of the building. Elmer flies over the edge and lands on the ground in a popcorn machine, and Bugs admits that Elmer is "a better man than I am, but only because I\'m a rabbit" and then departs down the sidewalk with the flower that Elmer had dug up in the opening scene.'] ["In a plot reminiscent of 1947's The Invisible Mouse, Quacker is a singing duck whom George bought for Joan.

At the beginning of the film, a German couple prove to a Nazi supreme judge that they are of pure Aryan blood and agree to give their son, whom they name Hans at the approval of the judge,The names "Franklin", "Winston" and "Joseph" can be seen on the judge\'s list of forbidden names, in reference to Franklin D. Roosevelt, Winston Churchill and Joseph Stalin. into the service of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party. They are given a copy of Mein Kampf by the judge as a reward for their service to Hitler; their passport contains spaces for 12 more children . This is followed by the only extended comical section of the cartoon, the tone of which is very light compared to the rest of the film. The audience is told that as Hans grows up, he hears a distorted version of Sleeping Beauty depicting Hitler as the knight in shining armor rescuing Sleeping Beauty, an obese Valkyrie representing Germany, from a wicked witch, representing democracy.  Thanks to this kind of distorted children\'s story, Hans becomes fascinated with Hitler as he and the rest of the younger members of the Hitler Youth give a portrait of him dressed as a knight the Hitler salute. In the following segment, the audience sees Hans sick and bedridden. His mother prays for him, knowing it will only be a matter of time before the authorities come and take him away to serve Hitler. A Nazi officer bangs on the door to take Hans away, but his mother says he is sick and needs care. The officer orders her to heal her son quickly and have him ready to leave, implying if Hans does not get well, he will be euthanized. He orders her not to do anything more to him that will cause him to lose heart and be weak, explaining that a soldier must show no emotion, mercy or feelings whatsoever. Hans eventually recovers and resumes his "education" in a school classroom, where Hans and the rest of his classmates all in Hitlerjugend uniforms, after giving portraits of Hitler, Hermann Göring and Joseph Goebbels the Hitler salute, watch as the teacher draws a cartoon on the blackboard of a rabbit being eaten by a fox, prompting Hans to feel sorry for the rabbit. The teacher, furious over the remark, orders Hans to sit in the corner wearing a dunce cap. As Hans sits in the corner as punishment, he hears the rest of the classmates "correctly" interpret the cartoon as "weakness has no place in a soldier" and "the strong shall rule the weak". This sparks Hans to recant his remark, and agrees that the weak must be destroyed. Hans then takes part in a book-burning crusade, burning any books that oppose Hitler, replacing the Bible with Mein Kampf and the crucifix with a Nazi sword, and burning a Catholic Church. Hans then spends the next several years "Marching and heiling, heiling and marching!" until he reaches his teens  still "marching and heiling" until he becomes an adult or "Good Nazi"  embroiled in hatred towards anyone else who opposes Hitler, "seeing nothing but what the party wants him to see, saying nothing but what the party wants him to say, and doing no more than the party wants him to do." In the end, Hans and the rest of the Nazi soldiers march off to war only to fade into rows of identical graves, with nothing on them except a swastika and a helmet perched on top. Thus Hans\'s education is complete. "The education... for death."'] ["Although this is a remake of a 1920's silent Our Gang episode called Uncle Tom's Uncle, the main character is Spanky.

"All these roads leads to Covent Garden" says the narrator, dramatist Alun Owen, and then there follows a montage of the market workers slowly beginning their night\'s work, work which they do 364 days a year. As the "streets are stirring", the vegetables and flowers begin to arrive and stalls are gradually set up; the overall pace of the editing picks up as the activity increases and the rhythm of night establishes itself. Up to this point, the rhythm of the film parallels that of the activities it portrays; the steady pace of the loading and arrival at Covent Garden gives way to a faster pace of editing as Anderson carefully establishes mood and feeling by focusing on the activities of several of the individual workers who are introduced to us by name. There is some casual bantering, some jokes, some time for a cup of tea, but it\'s mostly steady work. A montage of shots follows and it establishes the routine: flower and vegetable boxes are being opened and set up, their contents exposed for the buyers, lorries are unloaded, deliveries are being made to the stallholders until, finally all is ready. So Every Day proceeds by respecting the dignity of the market workers and their roles in the rhythm of the market\'s operations. Then the pace slows again: it\'s time for a breather before the buyers arrive. This time Anderson allows his camera and the pace of his editing to focus on many of the individuals relaxing; these include not only the market workers, but the “night time habitués” of the market cafes where they can get a cup of tea, have a chat, snooze a bit, and prepare themselves for the next phase. By 4 a.m. the market is empty, the streets are empty; the camera pans across silent rows of flower and vegetable stalls. We wait. “Daylight brings traffic back to the market” says the narrator, and the mood quickly changes. It\'s suddenly busier, noisier, and the film\'s rhythms reflect this. The familiar sound of the BBC Home Service announcer\'s “good morning” at 6.30am is heard against the arrival of many of the corporate buyers, those from the large store chains. By 7am business is brisk, and this is reflected in the many voice-overs we hear with snippets of conversation, orders being taken, porters given instructions, all the natural sounds of market activity placed over a montage of constant movement. Then, as movement is "steadily outwards" there is a sequence of porters  with boxes of all sorts, many mounted on their heads, moving the produce and flowers out to waiting lorries and larger barrows. As the market activity slows by about 8am, once again the film\'s pacing reflects a quieter time in the workers’ day. Cafes are busy again and older female flower sellers, around since Queen Victoria was on the throne, we are told, look for bargains as we hear their chatter about the old days when every man wore a flower. "By 11am there\'s nothing left" and loading of big lorries going out into the country is well under way. In a montage of loaded lorries leaving the market  the activities have come full circle: the market\'s day ends where it began, and film comes to an end with a review of the faces of the market workers to whom the film is dedicated.'] ["An empty room. Small. Dark. Dirty. A young woman is pushed in and the door is locked. It's the beginning of the worst nightmare as her entire freedom is slowly taken away from her. Forever."] ['Oswald and the girl beagle are at the fair, dancing on a wooden platform. All of a sudden, a large oppressive pit bull pulls it right under their feet, much to their surprise. The pit bull pretends to apologize in giving Oswald a handshake but snaps a rat trap at the rabbit\'s hand instead. When the large dog flirts with the girl beagle, the annoyed Oswald quickly takes her and walks out of the scene. Oswald and his date went to a refreshment stand to order ice cream sodas. Upon receiving their beverages, the pit bull shows up again, takes Oswald\'s drink, and consumes it. The girl beagle didn\'t drink hers but instead pours the stuff in the pit bull\'s hat without the latter noticing. As the big dog puts on the hat and gets covered in a creamy mess, the two little tourists immediately moved to another location. After spending a few moments at the punch pad game, Oswald and the girl beagle decide to have a ride. They then selected a bizarre one operated by a marsupial. The girl beagle was first to go as the marsupial launches her high in the air where she lands and slides onto a series of animals. In the end, however, she was nabbed by the pit bull. Oswald comes to her assistance by picking up a bow and shooting arrows at the pit bull\'s back. In this, the large dog drops the girl beagle and sets sights on the rabbit. Running from the pit bull, Oswald climbs and crawls through a small hole in the fence. The large dog attempts to get through too, only to get stucked half-way. The rabbit then draws a picture of a rat on the pit bull\'s rear, attracting a stray cat and then a hound. Both of which went in a mauling fashion. Eventually, the pit bull was able to get out of the situation and continues pursuing Oswald. Oswald, still on the run, enters a gate to the backyard of a house. Instead of going in also, the pit bull peeks through one of the windows. While his pursuer is still looking in, Oswald appears in front of the house from a distance and throws a stick at the other window, breaking the glass. The disturbed homeowner then opens the door in the blink of an eye, therefore smashing the pit bull between it and the front wall. Oswald comes to and writes a "welcome" message on the flattened dog before placing the latter in front of the door. The girl beagle then shows up in the vicinity, happily calling Oswald. She and the rabbit went to celebrate things with a kiss.'] ['As autumn draws to a close, Barney Bear prepares for his long winter\'s hibernation, but water leaks, a loose shutter, a noisy fire, a teakettle left on, and some stray embers all get in the way and keep him up until spring. After Barney puts a "Do Not Disturb until Spring" sign on his front door, he locks it and sets his alarm to go off at Spring. When he finally heads to bed, he ties up a leaking vine and accidentally bursts his hot water bottle with his weight. The leaky vine he tied up also bursts, pouring water all over him and his window bursts open, thanks to the wind, and blows snow all over him. Barney finally boards the window up, and tries to go to sleep until the fireplace cracks and makes the kettle whistle. Barney removes the kettle, only to have some coal fly up from the fireplace and down his pants from behind and set his rear end on fire. Barney cools his backside down on some snow, but finds he can\'t get back inside his house because he door gets automatically locked and his window was boarded up from earlier. Barney crashes through his boarded up window and is still insomniac, mainly because of his record player which he destroys in seconds. With Spring closing in, Barney tries counting sheep and finally goes to sleep, only for his alarm clock to go off and looks outside his window to see that Winter is over, and unhappily mutters "Spring!"'] ['More tells the story of an inventor who lives in a drab, colorless world.

Donald can't resist convincing his nephews that it really works as he supposedly regresses in age and eventually Donald tricks his nephews he turned into an egg. Soon they all run into trouble with an alligator and her two babies, as the egg Donald used was a gator egg."] ['The story begins with an origin of a racing game known as Poohsticks Pooh taking a walk to a wooden bridge over a river where he likes to do nothing in particular. On this day, though, he finds a fir cone and picks it up. Pooh thinks up a rhyme to go with the fir cone, but he accidentally trips on a tree root and drops it in the river. Noticing that the flow of the river takes the cone under the bridge, Pooh invents a racing game out of it. As the game uses sticks instead of cones, he calls it. Sometime later, while Pooh, Piglet, Rabbit and Roo are playing Poohsticks, they see Eeyore floating in the river below. After a somewhat successful attempt to get him to shore with a giant stone, he tells them that he fell in due to being bounced from behind. Piglet assumes it was Tigger who bounced Eeyore into the river. When Tigger arrives on the scene, he claims that his bounce was actually a cough, leading to an argument between him and Eeyore, but with some outside help from the narrator, the animals find out the truth: he had indeed deliberately bounced Eeyore. Tigger then says it was all a joke, but nobody else feels that way. Tigger disgustedly says that they have no sense of humor, and bounces away. As Eeyore seems particularly depressed this day, Pooh follows him to his Gloomy Spot and asks what the problem is. Eeyore says that he is unhappy because it is his birthday, and nobody has taken any notice to celebrate it. Pooh decides to give him a jar of honey, but does not get far before he has a hunger attack and ends up eating the honey. Upon realizing this, he decides to ask Owl for advice. Owl suggests that he writes to Eeyore on the pot so that Eeyore could use it to put things in, making it useful, and Pooh accepts. Owl ends up writing a misspelled greeting  on the pot and flies off to tell Christopher Robin about the birthday. Piglet, who heard about Eeyore\'s birthday from Pooh, has planned to give a red balloon to Eeyore, but when Owl greets him from the sky, Piglet is not looking where he is going, and as a result, he falls down and bursts it accidentally. Piglet is very sad that his gift for Eeyore is spoiled, but he presents it to him anyway, and only a minute later, Pooh brings the empty pot. Eeyore is gladdened, as he can now put the broken red balloon into the pot and remove it again. Pooh and his friends then pitch in and plan a surprise party for their friend. During the party, Tigger arrives and bounces Rabbit out of his chair. Roo welcomes him to the festivities as Rabbit draws himself up from being bounced on by Tigger, incensed. Rabbit opines that Tigger should leave because of the way he treated Eeyore before. Roo wants Tigger to stay, and Christopher Robin\'s solution is for everyone to go to the bridge (known in the television series My Friends Tigger & Pooh as Poohsticks bridge]] and play Poohsticks. Eeyore, a first-time player, wins the most games, while Tigger does not win at all, causing him to conclude that "Tiggers don\'t like Poohsticks". Eeyore\'s secret for winning, as he explains to Tigger afterwards, is to "let his stick drop in a twitchy sort of way." As Tigger bounces Eeyore again, Christopher Robin, Pooh and Piglet all decide that "Tigger\'s all right, really."'] ['The short begins with Donald wiping the fog off his glass door, excited to see the snow. Donald says that he is excited about snow. He opens his door and soon gets his bill frozen from the cold. He gets a fur overcoat and pulls a sled, while singing Jingle Bells. When Donald reaches the top of the hill, he notices his nephews, Huey, Duey, and Louie, at the bottom, building a snowman, while singing For He\'s a Jolly Good Fellow. Tempted, Donald crashes his sled into their snowman and thus his nephews, resulting each of them to "wear" a part of their snowman. While Donald is laughing himself silly, Huey, Duey, and Louie plot revenge. The next scene shows Donald\'s nephews piling snow and a duck-like head on a boulder. Donald is scraping snow off of his foot when he hears his nephews yelling, "That\'s Uncle Donald! That\'s Uncle Donald! That\'s Uncle Donald!", while standing by the degrading snowman of Donald. "Oh, yeah?!" Donald replies, and he shortly crashes himself into the snowman-disguised boulder. The shockwaves from the crash shake off all of the furs on his overcoat, save for one, that Donald touches with his finger to stop its shaking and pulls out. Now Donald\'s nephews are laughing themselves silly and Donald pulls off the remains of his overcoat. He dashes off to start chasing them. Donald runs so fast, that he blows the snow off of a kissing couple. The nephews dash across a frozen pond to the center, where an imposing fortress made of ice and snow stands. Donald bounces off the mattress door that they throw up, causing him to ricochet across the ice  and crashing into a tree. Snow piles on top of him  until he is "transformed" into a rhinoceros in a cage. As a victory song, the trio sings a verse of London Bridge while spinning and jumping in a circle. Donald bursts out of the cage, squawking angrily, and declares war on his nephews. Later on, Donald yells at his nephews from a snow battleship, that he created, while his nephews simply mock him from their snow fortress. Donald starts a small barrage of snowballs, which results the nephews into becoming like bowling pins, waiting for Donald to strike them out. Donald then pulls out a bucket of water, dips a snow chunk in it, and creates an ice ammunition  He launches it and it splits his nephews\' flagpole in three spots, "spanking" all three of them. Donald asks soon after if they surrender, and they clearly refuse. They start creating snow chunks of their own, while also getting three other objects: a picnic basket, some rope, and some mouse traps. They place the mouse traps in rocket-shaped components and stick them in the picnic basket now with the string tied to it. Huey, Dewey, and Louie soon launch the basket and release the missiles, with Donald getting hit by several of them. With Huey commanding them with a wooden sword, Louie and Dewey started launching snowballs from a catapult. Donald gets his hat spun off his head and yells, "That\'s unconstitutional!" before getting more snowballs launched at him. As his barrier starts shrinking with each hit, Donald looks up, gets smacked in the face, and is launched him into a smaller part of the ship. Being the little cheaters that they are, the nephews spear hot coal onto arrows  and launch them into the area where Donald currently is, creating a skull-like structure. As a final attack, they launch a flaming snowball into a part of Donald\'s ship. This leads Donald to scream at them "I\'ll exterminate you!" This causes the ship to start melting and end up with Donald frozen in a palm tree-shaped Prison of ice. To celebrate their victory, the triplets perform a  ceremonious Native American dance around the icicle; this latter performance was edited out of later broadcasts of the clip, due to perceived political incorrectness. This short was featured as part of the edited collection, Donald and His Duckling Gang, from 1979, and is featured in From All of Us to All of You which is shown on TV every Christmas in the Scandinavian countries. This short was one of the many featured in Donald Duck\'s 50th Birthday'] ["It's a story of a guy called Cheran , who goes through several stages of life to secure future for his widow mother and a younger sister.

It shows as how important is life insurance for everyone."] ['The story opens with several hens mothering their chicks in an ideal suburban fashion: taking them on walks and bragging to fellow hens about their exploits. One of the hens jokingly tells Miss Prissy that she is lucky not to have chicks to looks after, then Prissy overhears a group of hens saying that she will "never land a man" because she is "too much of a D-R-I-P." This depresses Prissy who then climbs up on to the roof of the barn. Meanwhile, Foghorn is seen preparing to attack the dog by with a board from a picket fence when he sees Prissy jump from the top of the barn. Foghorn dives to save Prissy, and Prissy sees Foghorn as not only a savior but a potential husband, a notion which Foghorn rejects. Foghorn then goes about his regular routine by picking up the board and going to the doghouse, where he lifts the dog up by the tail and repeatedly slaps his rear end with a board which causes the dog to chase him. Foghorn then closes the gate to the fence just in time for the dog to crash into it head first. Foghorn is then seen trying to slip a lit dynamite stick into the dog house, but the dog is wise to it and the trick backfires. Foghorn is then seen having a picnic with a large amount of food prepared by Prissy, but Foghorn rejects her again. The dog sees Prissy\'s attempts to court Foghorn and tells him that she is going about it the wrong way and offers to help out, seeing it as a way to rid himself of Foghorn for good.

The ruse works and Foghorn fights with the dog, and ends up in church exclaiming, "I won, I won", as he and Prissy are married. When Foghorn realizes what happened, he says to the audience, "Hey, there must have been some way I could have lost." He slaps himself to end the cartoon.'] ['Life is going along great for Brad and Penny until Brad brings home a smiling garden gnome.

However, they are quickly killed and the players blame the game master, Lodge, claiming he did not follow the rules and plotted against them. While Leo and Gary wish to play a different game the following week, Cass demands to play the same campaign again, even though they just played it for the second time, to preserve his reputation that there is no game he cannot win. Lodge wishes to publish his campaign as an official Dungeons & Dragons game module, but he is having trouble writing it: he knows how he wants it to end, but his players never actually finish the module. Gary suggests that for the next game they bring in two more players, in order to have a more well-rounded party. Cass is able to recruit his ex-girlfriend Joanna. However, Lodge is unable to find anyone  and resolves to be the fifth player . The campaign begins when the characters Luster , Flynn the Fine , and Daphne  are summoned before King Erasmus the Randomly Biased. The evil necromancer Mort Kemnon has discovered an artifact known as the Mask of Death and wishes to use this to overthrow the kingdom. As they go on their way, they are summoned before the Hierophant of the Order of Therin who sends two members of his order to accompany the party, Brother Silence  and Sir Osric  -- the latter of whom the other players  take an instant dislike to, as Lodge created Osric just to keep the story on track. On their way, the group runs into a large party of goblins. The men\'s overconfidence is shattered when Joanna singlehandedly wipes out the entire party of goblins, even though the men thought that she created a poor character . Resting at an inn near Westhaven, the group faces Mort Agrippa and defeat him. They head out for Westhaven and decide to stop playing for the night. Lodge explains to Joanna the reasons why he keeps the other players on such a short leash: if he does not, they will kill, plunder, and impregnate the fantasy world. The following week, the players continue the campaign by facing Drazuul in the town of Westhaven. Due to his character\'s weak traits, Leo goes through multiple copies of the character until the players are able to cleverly defeat Drazuul by hiding behind "the mound of dead bards". Torturing Drazuul with holy water, they learn of Mort Kemnon\'s location. Making their way through an abandoned mineshaft, they find a henchman from the previous campaign and take all the equipment. The battle goes poorly for the players, until Lodge\'s cat messes up the floor-tiles and Cass distracts Lodge while they place their characters in more preferable positions. After a lengthy battle with Kemnon , Kemnon is defeated and cryptically implies there is another enemy. It is revealed to be the Hierophant, who intends to use the Mask to rekindle the Light of Therin. The group then realizes that the "Heart of Therin", the church\'s most sacred relic, is actually a prison housing the deity. During a battle with the Hierophant, Leo finally proves to be of use as he awakens Therin from her prison, allowing Daphne to release her . Afterwards, Daphne is offered an unlimited wish by Therin. After the other players recommend she wishes herself immortal, she uses it to resurrect Osric, much to the extreme disapproval of Cass, who insults her and storms out. The other three continue playing, and Therin provides rewards for each: Flynn becomes a herald, Luster is stripped of her powers and becomes a cleric, and Osric becomes Lord High Marshal of the Paladins. The campaign ends, and with positive comments from Gary and Leo, Lodge is inspired enough to write his module and has it published. Sometime later, Cass apologizes for his behavior and the group begins another adventure. Lodge wants to send his group through the adventure module that another group was playing in the first Gamers film, but upon mentioning \'The Shadow\', Mark—the lone survivor of that campaign—screams in fear and runs from the gaming store. As the new campaign begins with the Mask of Death having been stolen, the film ends showing the henchman still alone in the mine.'] ["A young shepherd, Lucas, is blinded by lightning, and some kindly nuns at a nearby abbey take him in.

Service\'s poem The Shooting of Dan McGrew, complete with a literal depiction of a man with one foot in the grave, but when Dan McGoo turns out to be Droopy, it turns into another Droopy-versus-the Wolf/Wolf-goes-ape-for-the-girl gagfest. The story begins in Coldernell, Alaska - Population 320 and getting smaller&mdash;a wild, rough town where gold is king and gambling, drinking and shooting each other are the major activities. Droopy is Dangerous Dan McGoo, a lone gambler, whose only love is the girl they call "Lou", played by Red . The wolf drags himself into the Malamute Saloon from the 50-below cold and immediately pays for "drinks on the house". In a gag, the wolf wants a drink of whiskey . After he chugs it down, the film shows his stomach being blasted from the drink. His eyes go red, and smoke comes out of his ears. He flies around the room and comes back to the bar. Leaning over to the bartender, he complains, "This stuff\'s been cut!" As always, the wolf falls for Lou and tries to drag her off, when "The lights went out! A woman screamed and two guns blazed in the dark!" And when the lights go back up, Droopy is victorious, which makes one wonder why the picture is called The Shooting of Dan McGoo since he isn\'t the one getting shot!'] ["Oswald was playing piano in his apartment room, singing a swing song.

Meanwhile, Wallace  and Gromit are running a "Dough to Door" delivery service from their bakery "Top Bun". On one such delivery, the duo save Piella Bakewell , a former pin-up girl mascot for the Bake-O-Lite bread company, and her dog Fluffles, when the brakes on her bike appear to fail. They drive alongside so Wallace can attempt to use pastries to stop, but they careen into a zoo and barely escape being eaten by a crocodile. Gromit tests the bicycle brakes and becomes suspicious on learning that they work, but Wallace becomes smitten with Piella. A whirlwind romance ensues, during which it is also shown that the nervous Fluffles is treated rather shabbily by Piella. Fluffles and Gromit also share a sensitive moment after she timidly returns Gromit\'s possessions, which have been discarded by Piella, after she gives Wallace\'s house  a "woman\'s touch". However, when she leaves her purse at the house, Wallace decides to return it, but it is raining outside. Not wanting to get wet, he insists that Gromit return it instead.

After an angry outburst against bakers, she leaves but returns a short time later to apologise with a large cake. Wallace says that it will do nicely for four o\'clock tea. When Piella is leaving to attend to the absent Fluffles , she tells him he will be getting a surprise. A worried Gromit follows her home only to be caught and imprisoned with Fluffles in a storeroom. Escaping in Piella\'s old Bake-O-Lite hot air balloon, they arrive at Wallace\'s house as he is lighting the candle. After a struggle, the cake falls to the floor and a bomb inside is revealed. While attempting to dispose of the bomb, Wallace and Gromit are attacked by Piella, who detests bakers and their creations for ruining her figure and her career as the Bake-O-Lite girl after her obesity from consuming too much bread and cakes meant she could not ride her balloon anymore. While attempting to finish off Wallace, a battle ensues between Piella and Fluffles in a yellow forklift truck covered by giant oven mitts. In the chaos, the bomb ends up in the back of Wallace\'s trousers. Gromit and Fluffles neutralise the explosion using a large amount of dough while Piella uses the distraction to leap onto her balloon and escape. However, owing to her weight, the balloon crashes into the crocodile pit at the zoo where she is eaten alive . The balloon floats away with Piella\'s ghost  waving goodbye to Wallace on her way to heaven. Distraught by the death of her owner, Fluffles leaves, with both Wallace and Gromit depressed over their losses . Deciding to take their minds off things, they head out to deliver bread and find Fluffles standing in the driveway, uncertain as to what to do or where to go.

He seems to specialize in creating unnerving and unaccountable sounds in the night and proceeds up the stairs with a curious mincing gait. The boy, who can hear him approach, alternately hides under the covers and cranes his head about to see the impending danger, until he accidentally breaks his lamp and the noise alerts the Sandman to his location. An intruder into the boy's room pulls back the quaking covers, but it turns out to be his solicitous mother, who retrieves the broken lamp, closes his eyes reassuringly and quietly withdraws.

But in silhouette, we can see that the Sandman has also taken something and, his objective apparently attained, he abruptly flies out the open window and into the night sky. On the moon, the Sandman lands on what we now realize is his nest  which contains three of his tiny, hideous progeny. He opens a small, black pouch, and produces  -- two eyeballs.

The latter is theoretically a heroic quest, but while the game master attempts to foster in a narrative, the players tend to be more interested in their characters\' tolerance for ale, trying to apply the sneak attack damage multiplier to siege weaponry, et cetera. The movie both makes fun of gamer stereotypes and plays the discrepancy between an optimal RPG plot and the events of an actual RPG session for maximum absurdity. Characters attempting something dangerous freeze as dice clatter in the distance. The party thief picks the pocket of a bystander, then steals that bystander\'s pants -- not because he wants the pants in any way, but solely to see if his skill statistics allow it. When an unlucky dice roll causes the death of one character, the other players\' characters mourn him for a moment, and then immediately start squabbling over the items he was carrying. Characters spring to action, then keel over as their players forget and are reminded that the characters are asleep, players argue and make snack runs, and their game is frequently interrupted by a girl from the same dorm who demands they keep quiet so that she can study. The Shadow is eventually defeated, after a long quest, and the characters find themselves in a strange tunnel. On the other side of the door, they hear voices—the voices of their players, who are narrating the action in the hallway outside. Bursting into the room , the characters slaughter the gamers, then begin picking over the room for treasure. Discovering that their entire adventure has been documented by the \'strange sorcerers\' they\'ve just slain, they discover their character sheets . In the midst of these revelations, the \'Princess\'  bursts in and reads them the riot act, thinking their outfits to be mere costumes; after she leaves, the adventurers seem quite stunned that their beloved Princess has such a foul mouth and temper.'] ['The cartoon begins inside a house. In there, Oswald and the living female stuffed doll are enjoying together, playing a piano. On their instrument are a dancing candle stand and two mice playing the accordion. At a laboratory only a few miles away, a mad scientist completes construction of a robot and activates it. To the his surprise, the robot began swinging punches at him. The mad scientist, however, is able to evade the attacks and stops the humanoid machine with a punch of his own. He soon learns that his creation needed one more thing, a heart. Back in Oswald\'s place, the two friends decided to play hide-and-seek. Oswald was "it" and the doll became the one to hide. While the rabbit counts, his playmate has yet to look for a hiding place. Without a warning, the doll gets captured through an opened window by the mad scientist who then leaves a sack inside before fleeing. Convinced that the doll was hiding in the bag, Oswald approach and opens it. To his amusement, what comes out was a marching flute player. As the rabbit goes to find his friend, he notices a strand of thread on the window sill which he follows. The thread is fact the trousers of the mad scientist who will later appear in spotted shorts. At the laboratory, the mad scientist has the doll wedged in a vise and attempts to perform surgery on her, i.e. take out her heart and place it in the robot. But before he could start, the nefarious inventor sees through his surveillance device that someone came to his facility. Oswald reaches just outside of the laboratory after the following the whole thread. Upon knocking on the door, a trap activates, causing him to fall into a shoot, leading towards the basement. In an attempt to slaughter Oswald, the mad scientist waits for the little rabbit\'s arrival at other end of the shoot, preparing to swing an ax. The mad scientist swings but misses. From there, the chase begins. Oswald runs through several corridors of the laboratory. While approaching an intersection, he sees something white popping in and out of the left corner. For his defense, Oswald picks up a nearby urn. There was indeed a skeleton innocently sitting on a rocking chair by the left corner, but the mad scientist, who was coming from the corridor in that direction, pulls it away, and walks into the intersection. Upon seeing what entered his hallway, Oswald tosses the urn. The mad scientist was strucked right in head and was knocked cold. Oswald finds a rope and ties one end of it around his pursuer\'s leg, with the other end around a lion\'s tail. The lion runs in place, hanging the mad scientist above the floor. Oswald, at last, found the chamber where the doll was held. He loosens the vise and frees her.'] ['Construction workers find an old cache of bombs from World War II in an unnamed Russian town.

Voiceovers in a variety of English class accents offer a snapshot of what is being said about Germany in Britain . A series of images shows the country\'s shattered infrastructure, with destroyed roads, bridges, railway lines and factories. This is followed by shots of missing persons noticeboards and posters with the information that 30 million Germans &ndash; almost half the population &ndash; are still looking for lost relatives and friends. Destitute children are seen sitting aimlessly in the streets. A shot of a woman nursing a baby is accompanied with the statement "We can\'t wash our hands of the Germans, because we can\'t afford that new life to flow in any direction it wants". The military authorities are shown mobilising civilians to begin the task of cleaning up and rebuilding, and it is explained that the aim is to prevent not only starvation and epidemics, but also "diseases of the mind", i.e. "new brands of Fascism". People are shown living in the cellars of bombed buildings, without heat, light, water or sanitation. Coal is singled out as the single most vital resource, with the British "Coal Control" unit organising the output and distribution of the Ruhr coalfield production. A Catch-22 situation is detailed, whereby coal is needed for power and transport, but without the power and transport infrastructure already in place the coal cannot be moved to where it needs to be. There is no coal to spare for civilian use, so the populace have to forage for timber as a power source. Civilian railway travel on what survives of the network is only possible with a permit issued by the military authorities, but the volume of passengers still overwhelms the capacity. A train is seen leaving Hamburg for Kiel with dozens of people riding the buffers or hanging on the outside, ignoring loudhailer announcements that this is forbidden. The establishment of a new German police force is outlined, with the explanation that henceforth the policeman "must understand that he is the servant of the public, and not its master". Civilians receive food rations of between 1000 and 1200 calories per day. Survey teams from the Red Cross carry out tests on health to check whether the rations are adequate to keep people fit enough to work. Education is mentioned as a particular headache, as "you will never get Nazi ideas out of the heads of some of the adults". Children are seen playing among the ruins, but a new breed of teacher is being recruited to teach the next generation that "there are other things in life beyond Nazism and war". However schools and teachers are too few and children too many. The problem is that children are growing up "and getting more like their fathers". The Krupp family industrial dynasty is singled out for mention as "just as responsible for killing Allied soldiers as Hitler and Göring". Footage is shown of their destroyed ammunition and armaments factories. Surviving members of the Wehrmacht are seen being processed. These men must be reassimilated into society somehow, "not only their bodies, but also their minds". If so much as one man or woman is appointed to office while still believing in Nazi values and German supremacy, "you have the beginnings of another war". Therefore they are all put through a rigorous demobilisation screening process. Anyone who is on the wanted list, or otherwise suspect in any way. is rejected for demobilisation and sent "back to the cage". When the nightly curfew falls, the civilian population must get off the streets and fix for themselves as best they can. Air-raid sirens sound "to remind them that it is up to them to regain their self-respect as a nation". The film ends with images of children dancing in a ring accompanied by the statement that the Allies will remain until they can be sure that the next generation will represent "a Germany of light and life and freedom...truth, tolerance and justice".'] ['The host of an investigative news show joins forces with a techno-geek paranormal expert to dodge close-calls and chase crazy leads to get to the bottom of the mysteries around Talladega Superspeedway.{{cite web}}'] ['This fable tells of an old fishmonger who dies and resuscitates several times.

The angel rings an angelic Stepin Fetchit with enormous lipsWeisenfeld 79.—probably a reference to Oscar Polk\'s performance as Gabriel in The Green Pastures— that reads, "Pair O Dice Needs You!

The musicians go to Harlem and break into a performance of "Swing for Sale", and the Harlemites flock to listen.

The newcomers receive their halos, and in the cartoon\'s final gag, the Devil himself asks to be admitted. Clean Pastures is a musical film, which means that it shifts between musical and non-musical sections, both of which are integral to the story.Goldmark 93. Carl Stalling\'s musical score makes use of both public-domain music and songs owned by Warner Bros. Stalling\'s music "supplies both the foundation for the story and the driving force behind the animation." Music is of such importance that characters in Clean Pastures dance about even when no performers are pictured. A choir of a capella, black male voices opens the cartoon with "Save Me, Sister, from Temptation", a song from the 1936 Warner Bros. film The Singing Kid featuring Al Jolson. Thus, Stalling establishes one of the cartoon\'s themes, that sinners may be redeemed, from the opening credits. As the scene shifts to Harlem, the jazz standards "Nagasaki" and "Sweet Georgia Brown" accompany the bevy of African American vices. Caricatures of Bill "Bojangles" Robinson and Al Jolson perform snippets of the blackface tunes "Old Folks at Home" and "I Love to Singa". However, the short\'s major number is "Swing for Sale", performed by caricatures of popular black jazz performers. The short ends with a jazzed-up version of James A. Bland\'s minstrel spiritual "Oh!

The time is unexplained: it could be an offworld intelligence form visiting our planet, or it could be future human travellers visiting a remote galaxy.  Also it could be a fabricated dream, à la Soylent Green, experienced by one of our descendants willing to learn how precious and beautiful the Earth was in its prime and experienced through a chronological and geographical exploration of the planet. Dreams are a classic theme in Oshii\'s production including Urusei Yatsura: Beautiful Dreamer and The Red Spectacles. The pavilion concept\'s name "Mountain of Dreams" is probably not a coincidence. According to the theory, agreed by Oshii , that the futuristic projection of Science Fiction is nothing more than a metaphorous description of the present and current society, just like Montesquieu  and Voltaire  implicitly describing -criticizing- their own country through the eyes of a foreign character or civilization, this work could be viewed as a warning  to preserve our, current, highly menaced, biosphere and ecosystem before it is too late. This film was presented at the World Exposition hence its universal message and collective matter. The original title "Ark of Awakening" , is a double reference to the Bible\'s "Noah\'s Ark" and to Buddha, which means "awakened". In this perspective the movie can be interpreted as a futuristic, post-flood, returning trip to Earth on board an ark ship with the featured creatures being part of the breeding stock of saved animals. Vis-à-vis the amount of religious references being Shinto , Buddhism , the Bible (Noah\'s Ark, [[Flood  or the Greek mythology (Centaur, [[Chimera , and connecting them with the depiction of fantasy ancient or future- races that are the mysterious creatures, this work could also be regarded as a mythological tale of Creation , in the likes of Stanley Kubrick\'s Space Odyssey.'] ["The hero's  preoccupation with chess leads to him missing his own wedding ceremony, but the marital peace is restored with the help of the World Chess Champion, José Raúl Capablanca."] ['Introduction: The pair zooms into view and begin to chase, freezing momentarily for the credits and Latin names to be shown: COYOTE: Famishus Vulgaris and ROAD RUNNER: Birdibus Zippibus. From here, the Road Runner speeds off, leaving the coyote to fall on the ground. Wile recovers quickly, kicks up some dust, and begins to chase the Road Runner; the bird, though, leaves so much dust in the road that his pursuer cannot see ahead. Eventually, except for his ears, the coyote is completely enclosed in the dust. The Road Runner pulls next to the coyote and beeps, alerting Wile to his surroundings. The coyote\'s expression becomes foreboding, and the camera cuts out to show both apparently suspended in midair. As the dust clears, the coyote pokes his hands through the bottom of the cloud, and then looks down to see nothing but air below him. The dust completely clears, showing that the Road Runner is perched on the edge of a cliff and the coyote on the wrong side of him, and gravity then turns on. Determined not to let this happen again, Wile climbs up a very high escarpment and surveys his surroundings for the Road Runner...who happens to have pulled up right behind him and now beeps such that the coyote falls back down. The camera zooms in on an obviously miffed Wile as he falls to the ground again. Dusting himself off, the coyote gets up and walks out onto the road until the Road Runner beeps a second time and sends his rival directly into a low-slung rock plateau. 1. As he hasn\'t studied it enough, Wile follows the instructions of THE ART OF ROAD-RUNNER TRAPPING: # Dig hole in road # Camouflage hole # Wait patiently # Eat Road Runner However, he never gets past the first step, as his jackhammer vibrates enough to pull the coyote into the hole. When the power cord stretches enough to unplug the jackhammer, the coyote climbs out and finds himself vibrating sporadically. Wile walks over to the book and prepares to tear it in half, but another vibration does the job for him. 2. Still trying to halt the Road Runner, Wile builds a brick wall on the mountain roads and waits. Soon, he hears the Road Runner braking in front of the wall. When his ears recover from the sonic assault and the dust cloud settles, he quizzically looks around the corner of the wall to see his own rear end. Wile makes random movements, imitated by his rear, while looking behind and ahead of him, and finally determines that this is a duplicate of himself and rolls dynamite under his own rear. The firework promptly explodes, and Wile laughs until he realizes his own tail is aflame; he leaps directly into the air in pain and falls down to the ground. 3. Wile E., knowing about the "birds and the bees", leaves out bird seed while he prepares to release a fifth of Acme bumblebees from a distance. When Wile pulls the lid off, instead of attacking the munching Road Runner next to them, the swarm flies 400 feet in the distance towards the coyote and repeatedly stings him. 4. Wile now prepares a second bird seed trap, this time hoping to squash the bird with an anvil. Of course, when Wile walks onto the board to drop the anvil, the wood snaps under the combined weight and the anvil falls towards the Road Runner, who simply steps to the side out of danger. The board halves fall on top of the resulting crater to create a convenient bridge back to the feast. 5. Having had enough of the simple traps, Wile builds a lengthy steep ramp and lights a bomb intended for the Road Runner at the ramp\'s bottom, but which simply explodes instantly upon lighting  6. The coyote now prepares a giant catapult in the road; however, the boulder is too heavy for the catapult to sling at the passing Road Runner and flattens its owner. 7. Finally, Wile hopes to shoot the Road Runner with a harpoon gun. The rope, however, catches one of the coyote\'s feet and drags his rear over a cactus and under several rocks, then hurtles him into open space. Wile sees the fix he is in and recovers in time to grab the very end of the rope. Unfortunately, the rope continues into a very thin pipe, then out onto the road and directly into a chicken race with a truck. Wile smashes directly through the truck, and then the spear finally impales a rock face, but this leads to the coyote being swung down into the path of a train and bumped all the way up to the edge of a precipice, ragged, exhausted, gasping and sobbing. The Road Runner pulls up directly behind him, but instead of beeping, which would possibly drive his opponent insane , the Road Runner shows a soft side by holding up a sign saying: "I just don\'t have the heart." As he dashes back the way he came, the sign changes to "\'Bye!" The End. The title is a pun on the title "Room and Board".'] ['Unable to ignore the call of the ocean, a civil engineer builds his own ﬁfty-three foot sailboat and sets sail, transforming his dream of life at sea into reality.

Military test pilots and former childhood friends, loose cannon Isamu Alva Dyson and the Zentradi mixed race Guld Goa Bowman, are selected to each pilot a new aircraft  for Project Super Nova, to choose the newest successor to the VF-11 Thunderbolt variable fighter which is currently still in use by the U.N. Spacy military forces. Their own personal grudges end up disrupting the tests, and begin to wreak havoc on the program. Their rivalry heats up when a mutual friend, Myung Fang Lone, shows up. Myung was a childhood friend of both pilots, but the three of them had a falling out, and quickly grew apart. This is alluded to throughout the story, and evidence of the strained relationship between Myung and either of the two men is apparent, while their distaste for one another is obvious. When they meet again, they discover that Myung is now the producer of Sharon Apple, the hottest entertainer in the galaxy, who just happens to be an AI hologram. During a testing session, Guld and Isamu finally face off against each other- and an all out fight begins as each tries to best the other. Despite being in the middle of a testing area, they quickly proceed to tear the surrounding area to shreds in their fight to gain superiority over the other. Having turned off their communications equipment, both pilots fight using the test aircraft in a series of stunning dog-fight maneuvers before going into battroid form and finishing the fight on the ground. In the process, an "accidental" gun pod discharge injures Isamu and he is taken to the hospital, where he awakens to Myung standing watch over him. After returning to duty, a military tribunal questions Guld about their fight in the test area, but ultimately the decision is left up to the Admiral in charge of the project. Chief Miller, the station commander of New Edwards Test Flight Facility reluctantly tells both pilots that their mission and the project has been scrubbed by the U.N. Spacy High Command- due to the completion of a newer, and previously unknown aircraft, the Ghost X-9 - an advanced stealth UCAV prototype, which was secretly being produced on Earth while two other prototypes  were simultaneously being tested for Project Super Nova in planet Eden. With the Ghost X-9 completed, testing on the YF-19 and YF-21 was halted indefinitely, since the higher-ups believe that the new unmanned fighter is superior in every way. Meanwhile, the AI Sharon Apple has developed a malevolent consciousness and, during her concert in the Atlantis Dome inside Earth\'s Macross City, quickly takes over both the Ghost X-9 and the SDF-1 Macross Fortress and hypnotizes her audience and the Macross\' staff. When discovering that Myung\'s life is in danger, Isamu and Guld have to travel to Earth and set aside their differences to overcome the events from their childhood that drove them apart and caused them to hate each other. While Isamu goes after Sharon, who has taken over the SDF-1 Macross, Guld fights the X-9 and ultimately destroys it by removing the gravitational safety limiters on his aircraft, and matching the X-9\'s velocity/maneuverability until he achieves a target lock and shoots the X-9 down. However, removing the limiters allows Guld to achieve accelerations exceeding human  limitations, which ultimately leads to his death—even as he crashes the YF-21 into the X-9, destroying it. While fighting the SDF-1 Macross, Isamu is hypnotized by Sharon\'s voice, and is left to crash to his death. At the last second, Myung\'s voice reaches him and brings him out back to consciousness. Dodging the Macross\' fire, Isamu is able to destroy the central computer, effectively eliminating Sharon. The story ends as the sun rises over the Macross Fortress, with Myung waving to Isamu, who has survived the destruction of Sharon\'s computer.'] ['Shot on digital video, Boat features closeup shots of a man  taking a speedboat onto a lake, while a young woman  provides a dreamy, confused description of what is happening.

In the course of the game, the ball is kicked over to the other side. Using raw footage, the film chronicles the erection of the wall, civilian efforts to communicate with and assist East German escapees, and efforts by GDR border guards to thwart them. Shot in the first year after the wall was built, the film was narrated by Alexander Scourby, speaking for a citizen of West Berlin whose mother and children were stranded on the east side of the wall. The man is shown communicating with his children through hand signals; a risky endeavor, as East German civilians who were caught waving or otherwise communicating with people on the western side of the wall risked being forcibly relocated. For a brief time after the wall was built, civilians were able to escape by jumping from the westward windows of buildings close to the wall. Several such escapes were captured in the film, including one where communist policemen tried to pull a woman back into the room before she fell to the waiting firefighters below. GDR guards are filmed throwing tear gas at civilians on the western side of the wall, who threw the grenades back. After a short time, the windows of those buildings were bricked up, and barbed wire was strung on the rooftops. Trees and houses are shown being razed, lest they be used as escape routes. In the surrounding countryside, more civilians escape, despite the deployment of minefields and barbed wire. Another escapee is seen being injured in the face when she runs into a barbed wire fence. Another incident captured in the film is the death of Peter Fechter, an 18-year-old bricklayer's apprentice, who was shot by GDR border guards while trying to scale the wall and left to bleed to death. A memorial is shown for others who died trying to escape to West Germany. Three minutes of silence are held on the western side to commemorate those lost and killed, and the film ends with a young boy walking alongside the wall. {{Cquote}}"] ['The Crooked Eye follows a quiet woman through her daily drudgery while persistent memories of a recently unraveled marriage dreamily connect the guilty moments that made her world so unreal and unreliable.'] ['Nathan Chapel is a terminally ill comic book artist who possesses a lifelong obsession with death and a voyeuristic preoccupation with his self-destructive neighbor Sarah.

After arriving at the draft board, Donald greets an officer seated at a desk, presents his paper, and expresses his desire to join the Army Air Forces, adding excitedly "I came from a family of aviators!" The officer directs Donald to a room where he is to undergo a physical examination. Inside the exam room, a team of white-coated doctors hurriedly pass Donald around, measuring him and testing his vital signs, vision, and hearing. Several gags during the scene emphasize the Army\'s willingness to accept as many recruits as possibe; one example is when one doctor holds up a red card with the word, "red" printed on it and asks, "What color is this red card?". Donald answers, "Red." The doctor then holds up another card that is green with the word, "green" printed on it and says, "And this green one?" Donald answers, "Blue", to which the doctor replies, "Blue? That\'s close enough." In another example, the doctor holds a loud alarm clock directly against Donald\'s head and asks "Can you hear this?" At the end of the exam Donald is given his uniform and has his rear end stamped with a large "OK."This gag was taken directly from the short The Barnyard Battle  where Mickey Mouse gets stamped in a similar fashion.

Emile starts frowning about having to speak out, while Remy pulls a scroll and a two-dimensional animation starts by presenting the relation between a human and a rat in contrast with human-dog and human-cat relationships. Remy points out that humans regarded rats in former times as sacred and luck bringing. He says that during the Roman Empire if a white rat crosses your path, it brought good luck, while if a black rat crosses your path, it brought bad luck. He moves on to discussing black rats  and their connection to the Black Death, pointing out that it was caused by fleas not rats, resulting in the death of one third of Europe's population. Remy further presents the brown rat's  history, mentioning their part in ending the Black Death, their honorable position in the Chinese zodiac and their sacredness in India for being the transport vehicle of the Hindu god Ganesh. The symbiotic relationship between rats and humans is introduced before the second appearance of Remy and Emile in 3D animation. Emile pulls a scroll from the side and presents through 2D animation the benefits of rats for the human. He says that Jack Black was a rat catcher for Queen Victoria and that he kept the rats he captured as pets. Their use for laboratory testing and as pets show that they can have a good relationship with humans. Concluding the presentation Emile and Remy sing a song about the relationship between rats and humans. At the film's end, a long and drawn-out  disclaimer is shown asking children to stay away from rats, while Remy and Emile stand in front of it and try to remove it, urging the audience to ignore the warning and complaining about freedom of speech and lack of food, respectively."] ['Fields plays a dentist whose daughter desires to marry an ice-delivery man.

It smashes into the couple\'s car, with them still in it, on a hillside beside the lookout over Fawcett City. It\'s revealed that that meteor is in fact Black Adam returning to Earth from his long exile. The film then cuts to young Billy Batson living in a seemingly rundown slum with very little food and rats for pets. He rises from his bed wearing a fan t-shirt bearing the Superman crest. He goes to his kitchen to find food, but only finds potato chips, which he ends up feeding to the rats. On his way to rendezvous with Clark Kent in a nearby diner, he sees three bullies robbing a homeless man. After attempting to defend the homeless man, Billy himself earns a black eye for his trouble. The homeless man thanks Billy for his intervention, and calls him "The Captain". Billy responds by telling him he always try to do the right thing. Billy gives him the only currency he has - a subway token. On arriving at the diner, Clark buys the boy three breakfast specials, and tells him his intended story will bring the plight of him and those in his situation to public light. Billy tears into his plates ravenously. He tells Mr. Kent that he tries to be good no matter what. As the conversation continues, neither notice that Black Adam has appeared, hovering above the ground outside the diner and causes a destructive force by clapping his hands together and blowing a hole in the side of the diner. Clark attempts to protect the boy, but a blow from Black Adam sends him through several walls. He emerges from beneath the rubble and transforms himself into Superman. Adam stalks young Billy through the streets stating his surprise over the Wizard\'s choice to become the next Marvel, but Billy is completely unaware of what he means. Black Adam picks up a passing fire engine, but Superman appears and intervenes before Black Adam can use it to crush him. Billy then makes good his escape. Superman gets blasted by a bolt of electricity from Black Adam\'s fingertips and, after pulling himself free of the building he realizes Adam\'s powers are magically based, and he is vulnerable to it. This vulnerability throws Superman\'s victory into question, placing him and Adam at somewhat equal footing. Black Adam begins to use this to his advantage, but Superman responds with powers the magical being doesn\'t have - i.e. heat vision. After briefly subduing Superman, Black Adam continues his pursuit of Billy, who runs into a subway platform, first encountering the homeless man he attempted to help. The man gives him a subway token and tells him he told him he would pay him back. Billy runs further into the subway station, jumping onto the tracks with Black Adam in pursuit. Billy is standing on the tracks when a train appears and apparently runs Billy over, causing Adam to leave. Billy opens his eyes to find he is on an empty subway car. The token begins to glow in his pocket and when he takes it out he begins to crackle with lightning. In the lightning, Billy sees flashes of his past life; his parents headstone and the orphanage where he was placed. He gets off of the subway car and into the chamber with the statues of the Seven Deadly Sins. Billy finds his way to the Wizard Shazam who relays to the boy that he is the next Chosen One. He explains that Adam had been the champion he had chosen 5000 years ago, but Teth-Adam had used his power for personal gain and corrupted the gift. He was then banished to the farthest star in the sky, and now Adam has returned seeking vengeance. The Wizard then causes a cave in, telling him that he wishes to atone for the mistake of creating Black Adam, but tells Billy that should he need him, he has only to speak the Wizard\'s name. Billy narrowly escapes the cave as it collapses. Outside, the battle rages on between Superman and Black Adam. Superman is barely able to hold his own against the magical based powers of his foe. Superman is again subdued by his adversary and is rendered unconscious. Billy encounters Black Adam and defiantly tells Adam to leave Superman alone. He attempts to strike an amused Black Adam, who is about to kill Billy. Billy anxiously shouts "I could use a little help here, Shazam", which summons the lightning and Billy is transformed into Captain Marvel. He quickly counters an attack by Adam with his newfound abilities. Finally, Black Adam is forced to stand against his true equal. Billy has only the duration of the fight to discover his powers; i.e. speed, strength and flight. He also discovers that randomly saying the Wizard\'s name takes the powers away as quickly. A now recovered Superman is unsure of what to make of the appearance of this new scarlet clad person, but they soon discover they are on the same side. The battle is now two on one as the World\'s Mightiest Mortal and the Man of Steel engage The Original Champion of the Wizard, Adam, in full on combat. Black Adam starts resorting to destroying a dam which will flood nearby Fawcett City, intending to separate Marvel and Superman for a better chance of success. Landing on the street, Black Adam attacks a passing car, flipping it and removing it\'s female driver as a hostage. He tells Billy he must surrender himself in his mortal form, and he will release the hostage. Billy complies, and Black Adam throws the hostage into the air. But before Billy can say his magic word, Black Adam grabs him by the mouth to silence him. From out of nowhere, Adam is blasted by heat vision by Superman, who has completed his task of preventing the flood and saved the hostage after quickly freezing the flood with super cold breath, another ability that Black Adam does not possess. Another fight ensues between Superman and Adam, but Billy has reached his tolerance point and utters the magic word. Adam is beaten by Marvel who stomps him into a crater in the street. Superman talks him out of murdering Adam to prevent further acts of evil. Adam tells him angrily that only death will stop him. It is then that the homeless man appears once again and reveals himself to be the boy\'s guardian angel Tawky Tawny. Tawky reverts to his true form as a tiger and tells him that he will ensure that the Wizard will send him so far across the universe this time, it will take Adam ten thousand years to return. To evade being banished even farther from Earth, Black Adam shouts "Shazam" turning him back into his mortal form Teth-Adam whose mortal body was unable to withstand the amount of time that has passed and turns to dust in an apparent act of suicide. It was an apparent bluff, as Tawny admits the Wizard is indeed dead. As Tawny walks away, Superman looks at Captain Marvel and says "You have some unusual friends." Billy finds himself encountering the bullies again in the alley as before. The bullies push Billy against a wall, and defiantly dare him to talk back; daring him to say "...just one word." To which Billy replies "Shazam..."'] ['Based on three short plays by Susan Charlotte, the film follows the lives of six characters: a shoemaker and his customer, a cabbie and his passenger, and a dyslexic director and his date.{{cite web}}  In October 2001 a nervous real-estate broker  takes a ride with an over-enunciating cab driver .

Utilizing a Jack Webb impression, Tweety delivers his signature "I tawt I taw a puddy tat" line, then describes his adversary in detail: "A bwack cat, wed nose, white chest. Name, \'Tilvester." Tweety describes Sylvester\'s attempts, as follows: * The opening scene, where Sylvester simply crosses the street and walks up the stairs to the room Tweety is located in. An unseen woman tells him "SCAT!" and throws plates at him. Sylvester scurries down the stairs and out of the building. * Subsequently, Sylvester builds a makeshift bridge of wooden planks and uses a swing to get to the building across the way, where Tweety is housed. The bridge collapses as the nails come loose at the base, due to the cat\'s weight and its poor construction; Sylvester is flattened by a piledriver in the swing gag. * Sylvester\'s third attempt involves the use of a pilot\'s ejector chair to get at the high story window where Tweety is, but it hurls him straight through light wires, splitting the cat into several lengthwise pieces. * Tweety feeds with the pigeons at the city library. Sylvester stops by and chases his prey into an automat. Tweety takes refuge behind a window . Sylvester inserts a nickel into the slot, opens the door and gets a spring-loaded pie thrown into his face. * Following a mountain blizzard, Tweety puts spoons on his feet  to search for food. Sylvester comes after him on skis, and it appears the speedy cat will catch his dinner ... until he crashes into a tree. * Tweety hides in a treetop in a mine field. Sylvester uses a metal detector to try to avoid the mines, but Tweety throws a magnet at the cat, which draws all the mines and results in an explosion. * A chase on a high wooden bridge in Colorado, where Tweety hides beneath the deck, out of the cat\'s reach. A determined Sylvester saws a hole in the center of the bridge, but doesn\'t realize he is standing in the middle of the portion he\'s sawing off until well after he has begun his plummet to the river below. Unseen by his predator, Tweety steps out of his way. A British-accented man in a fishing boat spots the falling projectile headed straight for him and takes note of the situation, using Tweety\'s cacthphrase: "I tawt I taw a puddy tat!" Sylvester plunges straight through the boat\'s hull, causing the cat, the man and his boat to sink .'] ["Regina, the once popular girl has to make new friends at her new, conservative school.

If these wouldn't be enough, she decides to organize a cheerleader team."] ['{{plot}} Introduction: Like all Sam Sheepdog and Ralph Wolf shorts, this one revolves around Ralph Wolf trying to steal the sheep guarded by Sam Sheepdog. Unlike later episodes where Ralph will not attempt to steal any sheep until Ralph and Sam have officially started work, in this short Ralph uses the time between the shifts of the two sheepdogs to make his first move. 1. By the time Sam sits on the edge of his cliff to watch over the sheep, Ralph is already attempting to carry a sheep away. Sam casually pushes a rock over the ledge, which falls on Ralph\'s head. In a stupor, Ralph places the sheep on the ground and lets it go just before he falls unconscious and grows a large lump on his head. 2. Ralph next attempts to drop a large boulder on Sam, but a tree branch catches the boulder and propels it upwards again as it crushes Ralph. 3. Ralph\'s next attempt is to pole vault over Sam to get a sheep. Sam casually grabs the pole, lowers it over the edge until Ralph is eye level with Sam, and punches him in the face. 4. Next, Ralph attempts to sneak into the field by surrounding himself with a cloud of smoke from an Acme smoke bomb. Sam heads him off at the pass and drops a stick of dynamite in his smoke cloud. After the explosion, Ralph stumbles back in a cloud of black smoke. With his lack of vision and coordination, he accidentally falls off a cliff. 5. In Ralph\'s fifth attempt, he uses an Acme disguise. The box is labelled "Acme artificial rock. Have fun. Be popular. Be a rock!" Ralph attempts to sneak past Sam with the rock disguise, but Sam hits the fake rock with a sledge hammer. Ralph breaks apart into a number of pebbles which all move back into Ralph\'s cave. 6. Ralph\'s next attempt is to dive off a cliff while tied to a very large helium balloon and carrying a fishing rod to snag a sheep. As he casts his rod, he unwittingly snags his balloon with his fish hook and rips the balloon, sending him flying into the horizon. 7. Ralph then attempts to tunnel under the field. As he reaches up through the holes, he feels what appears to be four sheep legs strapped on to a large drum of TNT. Believing this to be a sheep, he pulls it into his tunnel. After the explosion, he places the riven drum back where it was sitting. Blackened and dejected, he refills his tunnel. 8. In Ralph\'s eighth attempt he swims through a stream with a pedal-powered submarine to catch a sheep which is taking a drink of water. As he swims, Sam holds a sign in front of his periscope which reads "DETOUR". After following the arrow on the sign, Ralph falls off a waterfall. 9. Ralph next attempts to propel Sam off his perch by placing an improvised teeter totter under Sam and dropping a rock on it from a large height. Unfortunately for Ralph, Sam is propelled straight upward toward Ralph\'s cliff, upon where he grabs Ralph by the neck and begins punching him in the face. Finally, the punch clock whistle blows and Ralph and Sam change shifts with their replacements Fred Wolf and George Sheepdog. Their replacements stand in the same position Sam and Ralph were standing in before the whistle blew and George begins punching Fred in the face.'] [':Numerous lifeforms that transcend our common sense exist across the universe :As there are friendly and useful lifeforms, there are others who intend to destroy or conquer our planet: the invaders. :On and after 1960, successive invader incidents occurred. :In consequence of these inexplicable events, the UN formed the Space Vigilance Federation in 2000. :And in accordance to the Space Vigilance Law, the Earth Defense Organization was created. :Many war and combat professionals were gathered from across the world. :All of them, having greatly trained body, mind and combat abilities, :receive a combat Turbo-suit from the orbiting satellite and stand against the menaces from outer space. :The Earth Defense Department: Defenders of Earth...and its most powerful man, codename: SPECTER Agent Tetsuya Teresaki is the local Earth Defender enforcer in Japan.

The two face several traps along the way including a pit, but Indy and Satipo continue their journey. When Indiana Jones has to get across tiles that lead to the altar with the idol, he dances on them, leaving Satipo a bit confused. Once he crossed the tiles, Indy grabs the idol and runs as the temple collapses. Satipo crosses the pit first, and gestures for the idol in exchange for giving Indy the whip. Indy throws the idol, but it hits Satipo in the head and knocks him out. Indy then builds a bridge out of Lego pieces to get across the pit, and once he crosses it he retrieves the whip and idol. The boulder trap is triggered, but Indy was able to escape. Once outside of the temple, he finds René Belloq waiting for him with two Hovitos warriors. Suddenly, the boulder crashes through the doorway where it was stuck and flattens René Belloq and the Hovitos, as Indy jumps away into Jock\'s seaplane, where Indy is seen with a check list and crosses "Idol" off the list.  Indiana Jones and Marion Ravenwood are seen in a tomb with the Ark of the Covenant. As they try to fend off snakes, two German soldiers hoist the Ark out of the tomb, Indy and Marion then build a Lego elevator to escape the tomb. Indy and Marion safely get out of the tomb, and Indy goes on a horse to chase the truck that has the Ark. Indiana spots his father, Henry Jones Sr., reading a book about golf on a motorcycle. Indy jumps into the motorcycle and drives it. German soldiers on motorcycles drive toward the two and Indy grabs a flag, and knocks down both soldiers, and then uses his whip to get himself on top of the truck. The driver stops abruptly, and Indy falls onto the hood of the truck, he then accindentally pulls a piece of the hood off and falls, and goes under the truck until he reappears clinging to his whip, which was still hanging there from when he got on the truck. The grill of the truck breaks off and goes under it. Indy gets onto the grill and surfs on it, then leaps into the truck, and knocks the two German soldiers, a window frame, and a Stormtrooper out of the truck. Indy gets to the driver and pushes him out as well. Indy drives the truck, and his father then joins him to ride off into the distance.  This chapter opens up with Indy riding an amphibious vehicle in a river in a jungle. Mutt Williams comes out of a pitched tent and is delighted to see Indy coming back, but when Indy\'s vehicle gets on land and accidentally runs over Mutt\'s motorcycle, Mutt gets angry briefly. Indy shows Mutt the checklist with "Idol" and "Ark" checked off. The only unchecked item on the list is "Skull", and the two journey into the jungle. Suddenly, a rumbling sound is heard in the distance, and cutting through the jungle is Irina Spalko on a jungle cutter. The two run from and escape the cutter by falling into a ditch. They find themselves on a mine car, which runs down a track, around a rollercoaster-style loop and out a door that literally says "END OF RIDE". They see the jungle cutter again, and they continue running from it. When they go under an archway towards the temple and the jungle cutter tries to follow, it crashes. Spalko is then thrown off the vehicle and the jungle cutter gets destroyed. It forms a new machine with a saw blade, and Indy and Mutt decide to cut some pepperoni with it. Later, Indy and Mutt arrive at the temple entrance, but two natives stop them. They point to Indy, then Mutt, and then to a sign that says a person had to be as tall as a part of their spear to enter. Mutt is too short to go in, much to Indy\'s laughter, but he is able to go in anyway. Inside the temple, Indiana and Mutt run from spears  until they come across a mirror. Indy\'s reflection is Han Solo , and Mutt\'s reflection is of Chewbacca, . Later, while Irina and Mutt are in a sword duel, Indy takes the Crystal Skull from one of the skeletons. The temple collapses behind the two, probably leaving Irina to be crushed, and a close-up shows the skull as the movie ends.  On Cartoon Network and on its website, Chapter 3 replays and then Chapter 4 starts. But on the Lego Indiana Jones website, Chapter 3 does not repeat itself, as all four chapters are presented together in the order they were released. The chapter begins at a party at Indy\'s place. Mutt hangs the Crystal Skull on a string together with other lanterns and seems to be a good bug electrifier. The Idol is used as a candle holder and the Ark is used as a grill. And Henry Jones Sr.  toasts glasses with Mutt\'s cup. It is then revealed that the film was being watched in a movie theater by Lego versions of Steven Spielberg  and George Lucas, who nod at each other as the movie ends and give each other a high-five with a whip crack.'] ['All day long, cheerful clouds in the sky make cute and cuddly babies, such as human boys and girls, kittens, puppies, and other creatures, and give them to storks for delivery to the expectant parents.

He is met by two physical manifestations of his personality — the classic "good angel on one shoulder, bad devil on the other shoulder" dilemma common to cartoons of the time — identified as the "thrifty saver" and the "spendthrift." The "good duck" appears as a slightly elderly duck with a Scottish accent who wears a kilt and Scottish cap and urges Donald to be thrifty with his money so he can be sure to pay his taxes for the war effort. The "bad duck" appears as a zoot suit-wearing hipster who urges Donald to spend his duly earned money on idle pleasures such as "good dates". The good angel reminds of other "dates" - the dates when his taxes are due.  The narrator explains that Americans should "gladly and proudly" pay their income taxes which are higher that year "thanks to Hitler and Hirohito."  A tug-of-war ensues between "spend" and "save" with Donald caught in the middle. Eventually the two sides give way and crash on opposite ends of Donald to reveal the "true" selves: the doors of the bad duck\'s club are revealed to be swastikas and the bad duck himself turns out to bear a resemblance to Hitler , while the wall the good duck has crashed up against resembles the flag of the United States. The narrator then asks the audience if they are going to "spend for the Axis" or "save for taxes".

When Foghorn regains his senses, he asks Banty why he threw the punch, and Banty says that every time he hears a bell, he starts punching. Foghorn ponders this  and then concocts a plot to exact revenge on the dog. Foghorn decides to send Banty to the dog\'s house to ask for a punching bag. Banty seems temporarily confused  but obeys Foghorn and asks the dog for a punching bag. Foghorn then rings a triangular chime which causes Banty to punch the dog. When the dog confronts him, Banty says that Foghorn sent him over. The dog then figures to get even with Foghorn by giving Banty a gift-wrapped box and telling him that the punching bag is inside. Foghorn warns Banty that the box may be a trap but opens the box anyway, revealing a coo-coo clock. The clock chimes and Banty punches Leghorn again. Foghorn changes tactics and tries to bribe the dog to be Banty\'s sparring partner, but it is really a ruse to torment the dog again. The dog then tells Banty that he cannot spar with him but promises to find him another partner. The dog sets up one last scheme by luring Leghorn to a tree trunk  that supposedly has a show with dancing girls inside. Foghorn falls for the scheme and sticks his head in the trunk but nothing is there except a small hole above him. Foghorn muses that the hole is some kind of "peep show" and sticks his head inside, but the dog has set up a miniature boxing ring on top of the tree trunk where Banty is ready to spar, and thanks to the dog\'s scheme Banty has the perfect-sized partner—Foghorn\'s head.'] ['Introduction: Like all Sam Sheepdog and Ralph Wolf shorts, this one revolves around Ralph Wolf trying to steal the sheep which Sam Sheepdog is guarding. The short begins with a juxtaposition of how Sam and Ralph get to work. Sam takes a leisurely drive to work in what appears to be a caricature of shoddy Ford Model T. Behind him, Ralph speeds past in a drag racer. After Ralph hastily parks and walks away, Sam pulls into his spot, careful to make the correct hand signals as he turns. 1. As soon as the whistle blows, Ralph sprints off to catch a sheep. Sam lumbers to his perch, grabbing a rake on his way and drops it in front of Ralph\'s path. Ralph steps on the rake causing the rake to smack him in the face. As the sheep jumps away, it lands on Ralph\'s back, bending him in half. 2. Next, Ralph attempts to use a lever to launch a stick of dynamite into Sam. However, as Ralph jumps on to one end of the lever, the stick of dynamite simply rolls into him. 3. In Ralph\'s third attempt, he rolls an open barrel of gun-powder down a hill toward Sam, which leaves a trail of powder as it rolls. Ralph lights the trail after the barrel starts moving, but the barrel hits a rock and flies over Sam and under a boulder. The barrel subsequently explodes and sends the boulder flying and ultimately falling on Ralph, who, naturally, attempts to protect himself with a very small umbrella.  4. Next, Ralph purchases a box of "Two  Acme bed-springs", which he straps to his feet to increase his stride. After a few failed practise attempts, he gets the hang of it and heads off toward the field. As Ralph jumps over Sam, Sam pulls out a very large magnet which he uses to pull the springs off Ralph\'s feet in midair. Luckily, Ralph has a parachute. Unluckily, the wind blows him right next to Sam. As the parachute falls over Sam and Ralph as a shroud, Ralph attempts to run, but caught up in the fabric, Sam is able to grab Ralph and punch him. Ralph ultimately skids toward the edge of a cliff, where, after realization of his predicament, he falls. 5. Ralph\'s final attempt is very drawn out and plays on Sam\'s uncanny ability to be wherever he needs to be. Ralph first notices that Sam and one of the sheep are separated by a very large chasm, so Ralph attempts to cross the chasm with a trapeze. Upon crossing the chasm and grabbing what he thinks to be a sheep, it turns out he grabbed Sam. After realizing this mistake, he deposits Sam on the first cliff, only to swing back and discover that Sam is on the far cliff again. Ralph then decides to climb the trapeze, only to find that Sam is holding the trapeze. When Ralph then decides to slide down to the bottom of the trapeze, he finds Sam sitting there. Cutting all his losses, he decides to dive off the trapeze, and as he\'s falling he notices Sam sitting on three small cliff outcroppings, a branch, in a hot air balloon, fishing in a small dingy, and sleeping under water. Ralph then swims as fast as he can, into the mouth of a whale to find Sam standing against one of the whale\'s teeth. In shock, Ralph jumps out the whale\'s blow hole, to find Sam sitting in an inner tube atop the whale\'s spray of water. Ralph then runs, through the air, to the closest beach, where he finds the beach is full of at least two dozen instances of Sam, and for the first time they\'re all visible at once. As Ralph blows his top, the punch clock whistle blows and Sam begins driving home. As he\'s driving, an ambulance passes him and Ralph can be seen in the back tied up in a straight jacket. The two politely wish each other good night.'] ["Outside of the city of Nazareth, a young boy and his father own four donkeys. Three of these donkeys are young and strong. The fourth donkey, Small One, is old and weak, but the boy loves him anyway. Everyday, the boy and the donkey play together before they go to work, helping the boy's father to collect wood. The boy and his father take the donkeys to work one morning, as they always do. Many times, the boy loads Small One with small sticks, since Small One can't carry heavy loads any more. Small One even has trouble carrying stacks of small sticks and the boy helps to carry them for him. That evening, the boy's father tells the boy that he has to sell Small One. Devastated, but understanding, the boy asks if he can be the one to sell his best friend. The father agrees and tells him that he has to sell him for one piece of silver. That night, the boy comforts Small One and promises to find him a gentle and loving master. The next morning, the boy takes Small One to the market in Nazareth. Unfortunately, nobody wants an old weak donkey but the tanner, and he only wants to kill Small One to make leather out of his hide. After failing to find another buyer, the boy and his donkey return to the tanner's shop. The boy weeps, and Small One, accepting his fate under the tanner's knife, tenderly consoles the boy. Just as everything looks bleak, a kind man comes up to the boy and asks if Small One is for sale. The man needs a gentle donkey to carry his pregnant wife to Bethlehem. The boy sells the donkey for one piece of silver  and watches as the couple and Small One leave on their journey as a bright star appears in the sky."] ["Within an old dilapidated and seemingly automated theater, human-sized marionettes perform a production of the Don Juan legend without the aid of puppeteers or an audience. In the play, Don Juan's fiancee Maria is secretly seeing his brother Don Phillipe. Unbeknownst to the two lovers, Don Juan is watching them from one of the balconies. Horrified by the thought of Maria leaving him for Philippe, he calls upon his Jester servant for help. So that he can pay for a wedding, Juan sends the Fool into town to ask for money from the Mayor , under the false pretense that Juan needs the money to pay off medical bills . When Juan's father learns about his son's true intentions, he gives the Jester two coins so he and Juan can buy some rope to hang themselves with. Outraged by this, Don Juan murders his own father backstage and heads over to the garden where Maria and Philippe were planning to meet. Maria arrives shortly after but is shocked to discover Don Juan there instead of her true love Philippe. Demanding that she return his feelings or face the consequences, he chases after Maria but is stopped by her father, Don Vespis, who now realizes Juan is unfit to marry his daughter and threatens to have him arrested. Don Juan dispatches of Maria's father by cutting his face off, and as he lay dying he swears his ghost will haunt Don Juan to exact his revenge. Philippe soon discovers Maria mourning her dead father, and swears to avenge them both. He eventually finds Don Juan and the two engage in a duel which ends with Philippe's gory demise. The Jester then arrives to tell Juan that there is a spectral man who wants to speak with him in the cemetery. The man turns out to be the spirit of Maria's dead father, who warns Don Juan that his soul will be dragged to Hell at midnight. As in the traditional Czech puppet plays, Juan urges children not to commit evil deeds like him. Juan's physical body keels over dead into an open grave, while his spirit is lowered into a trapdoor. Instead of being dragged into Hell as the legend suggests, the lifeless puppet merely falls into a compartment beneath the stage. Upon discovering an inanimate Don Juan, The Jester asks how he is going to get paid with his master dead."] ['A jet-propelled white rabbit flies through the vulva of a supine woman into a wonderland where people and objects turn inside out, changing shapes and identities at warp speed.

Although the bird brushes Tom\'s torso off and reacts politely like "pardon me", Tom goes after the bird, catches it, and proceeds to beat it up. Jerry wakes up hearing this and goes after Tom by tying a string to his tail, throwing the string over a tree then tying the other end to a telephone pole. After this, he cuts the pole and tips it enough to lift Tom up into the tree. The bird and Jerry then fill a large tub with water, put it on an outside fireplace, light a fire underneath, then the bird loosens the string and lets Tom sling-shot into the tub, where he splashes around yelling, jumps out and bounces away and back . The bird and Jerry laugh at the fact Tom looks bottomless. Tom grabs the hose and chases Jerry and the bird into the mousehole, and tries flooding them out, but Jerry and the bird stop the hose with a mousetrap until the water backs up enough and the bird comes out and pops the hose, leaving Tom tied up in the hose. Tom then tries catching the bird on an electrical wire and almost electricutes himself, then falls off into a wheelbarrow and into a shed, where he gets an idea. He turns himself into some kind of bird then climbs a tree, but before he could take off, Jerry brings an electric oscillating fan over, turns it on, and Tom loses his balance, falls off and bounces away. Next, Tom returns to the house with a box saying DANGER. We find out it\'s a cannon, and while he is trying to take aim at the bird, Jerry sneaks down, drills a hole in the missile, then ties Tom\'s tail in it, so when he fires the missile, he is taken with it into a tree. Finally, in the most memorable scene, Tom takes all the grass around the outdoor fireplace, sets it in there and sets it on fire, causing smoke to just about blanket the sky. Afterwards, he grabs a lawnmower and mows a strip in the field, then lines the strip with Christmas lights, illuminates them, then waits at the end of the strip with his mouth open. However, instead of the bird, a jet airliner comes down and picks Tom up by his mouth. After the plane flies over the tree Jerry and the bird are in, Tom lands on the same branch they\'re on. The bird then slaps a sticker saying "VIA AIR MAIL" on his forehead, kisses him, then salutes him, while Tom wearily returns the salute.'] ['A family loses their daughter, Sarah, in an car accident.

He stops and asks a peon where he can find the marshal. The peon replies, "You mean the one with the red hair, the big nose, who goes \'Ha-Ha-Ha-Ha-Ha\'?" The bandit says, "That\'s him." The peon replies, "I don\'t know." A disgusted patron runs to the marshal\'s office for help, and soon, outside the swinging doors, appear two long legs in cowboy boots. The bandit sees this, turns chicken, and finds that the legs he saw are actually those of Woody on stilts. In the final sequence, with Dapper Dan and the peon on a handcar running head-on into an engine, the peon jumps unharmed, but the bandit is really shaken up. Tapping the peon on the head, he asks, "What happened to that woodpecker?" The peon takes off his hat, false face and short, and it\'s Woody Woodpecker who now has the bandit securely tied up so that he can cause no more harm or trouble.'] ["Nagisa Kasumi  has a job as a delivery girl and makes her deliveries with a girl named Kawai on a base in the Moon.

Johnny has been willed her castle and all of her property and money, but he must visit the actual castle to claim these things. The 3D effects start almost immediately as the audience sees Johnny\'s car driving up a winding path to the castle. The branch of an old, withered tree seems to reach off the screen at the audience, and crows fly towards them. As Johnny enters the castle, he walks through a hall with several suits of armor. They come alive and begin attacking him . Suddenly a demonic being appears and destroys them all, then beckons Johnny further into the castle. Johnny stumbles on a room of instruments levitating and playing themselves, and then walks into a great hall. There is an orb embedded into the ground that begins projecting the image of Johnny\'s mother. This segues into a rather lengthy musical number in which this holographic image  sings an operatic number while the cameras circle around her.  Suddenly, a demonic face appears in the fire. It is the devil  who explains to Johnny that his mother sold her soul for her fame. Part of the agreement was that the devil could "not touch" Johnny. Now that she has died, Mr. D offers Johnny a similar agreement. He declines, but is enticed to explore the castle further. He enters a cathedral-like room which begins to descend. Soon Johnny is in Hell proper. At this point the film begins to take a very dark and gothic turn as Johnny\'s tour guide, Mephisto , guides him through the sections of Hell where musicians who have sold their souls are violently tortured. Mephisto reveals that there was a time when luring people to Hell with fame in music was unsuccessful - until the invention of Rock and Roll. Johnny is taken on a roller coaster ride through Hell that includes stops in a performance hall where the souls of the damned are trapped inside robot monkeys. They are forced to perform for an audience of demons while a wrecking ball swipes them off the stage and destroys them one by one. Eventually Johnny ends up in a decrepit opera hall where the worst of the tortures are taking place. Here he witnesses opera singers being decapitated or lowered into vats of acid and barracuda. Mephisto reveals to Johnny that Mr. D once had a romance with an opera singer who broke his heart and now D has a particular fondness for torturing opera singers. Johnny eventually ends up back in front of Mr. D who once again entices him to sign. Mephisto gives Johnny a guitar and he considers the offer, then throws the guitar into the flames and begins to sing opera at the top of his lungs, and it takes on an ethereal quality. Mr. D disappears, Mephisto attempts to flee, and the entire castle collapses. The film jumps ahead six months later, and we see that Johnny is now a famous rock and roll star . The last five minutes of the film feature a performance by Arid, as the credits float by them in little bubbles burst by demons.'] ['A one-armed beggar receives a new limb from a strange store that specializes in human appendages.

What is homelessness? Today in all societies the problem of homelessness can be observed. In modern countries like Britain, homeless people can be seen in big cities such as London. Despite the British government’s efforts to tackle this problem, there are about 250,000 homeless people in this country. This documentary film is emphasizing from one side, on the homelessness as an odd element in the modern society, and from another side to the homeless person himself, who represents the sufferings of mankind of our time. Many reasons contribute to becoming homeless, these include unavailability of employment opportunities, which becomes a vicious circle due to the initial problem of being homeless, domestic violence, poverty, caused by many factors including unemployment and underemployment. Increased wealth disparity and income inequality causes distortions in the housing market that push rent burdens higher, making housing unaffordable. This documentary film analyses many of these issues and problems.'] ['Andy, the gun store owner, created a video journal of his last days inside by himself. The prologue says that survivors found the tape in the store while traveling through Everett, Wisconsin and then shows the unedited footage. The character Andy  owned the gun shop across the street from the mall in the film, and in this bonus feature Andy records a video diary of his ordeal for future reference. He begins recording on May 7, 2004, the day after he first encountered the flesh eaters, and continues to record until his death on June 6. Throughout the diary he talks to his goldfish named Ariel for company. He tells of how he first encountered the zombies while driving his truck and, after running over several, makes it back to his home in the gun store. Andy reinforces all windows and doors and prepares to stock up on water and drinks, not having any food. Later, he relays the results of experimenting with killing the zombies saying he shot one in the heart, lungs, legs, without stopping it. He announces that the power is still on, as is the Internet, which shows red spots on a map of the globe, which obviously represent infected areas. He then tries to simply kill all of the zombies surrounding his store  but soon realizes it is a futile effort. With his mental state beginning to deteriorate, he begins to rant, blaming the government as the cause of the zombies. After the survivors in the mall make contact with him, he joyfully describes playing the survivors version of Hollywood Squares with Ken. Later on May 21, he is so weakened by hunger that he is forced to regretfully eat Ariel. The final entry starts immediately after he has been bitten by the creatures that managed to get in after Chips the dog. In an alternate view of the scene from the film, he communicates with the mall residents on the walkie-talkie. He knows the wound is worse than he has told the others in the mall . He tries to rest to relieve the pain and the video then actually shows him having transformed into a zombie and presumably going up to the roof for the movie scene. Between entries on the tape, it can be seen that the video is recorded over footage shot almost a year prior of Andy\'s ex-wife Susan and his unnamed daughter  playing outdoors. In the journal, Andy mentions how his wife got everything from him in the apparent divorce; including his beloved daughter . He expresses constant worry and grief at the thought of whether or not his daughter managed to survive and promised himself to get her as soon as he got out. The end of the recording shows Andy\'s daughter giving him Ariel as a birthday present on August 23, 2003. During Andy\'s talks of worry for his daughter, he mentioned "going up to the lake to get her", indicating she may be in the vicinity of Lake Michigan.'] ['The Inspector and Sergeant Deux-Deux are assigned to take down a notorious "pique poquette"  named Spider Pierre, so named because he has four arms and two legs. Their first attempt to lure him out is at a favorite watering hole of Spider Pierre, where The Inspector, after borrowing a thousand francs from Deux-Deux , goes in, flashes it around, and orders a drink. While waiting for the drink, he puts his wallet in his back pocket, where it is quickly snatched by Spider Pierre. After he drinks his drink, he goes to pay for it, and realizes his wallet was taken. The bartender then violently throws him out. Undeterred, The Inspector obtains more money from Deux-Deux  to go back in.Before Deux-Deux could tell him that the money is play money belonging to his daughter,Maria,the Inspector tells him to synch his watch,but as they go to synchronize their watches, Spider Pierre sneaks up and takes just about everything out of The Inspector\'s pockets , convincing him they were dealing with a vacuum cleaner. While chasing Spider Pierre through an alley, Pierre whips out his "spider webley specialist"  and uses it to spin a web at the other end of the alley, which slingshots The Inspector\'s car back all the way into the Eiffel Tower, damaging it . Later while chasing Spider Pierre on foot, Pierre sends a piece of thread to the top of a building and climbs up, followed by the Inspector, who afterwards walks on another piece of thread like a highwire, only to meet Pierre at the other end holding the other end of it. He lets go and the Inspector swings into the side of a building, taking out part of the wall. He crashes down with the wall, only to have a safe crash on him and send him through the pavement into a subway line. In the next scene, The Inspector is chasing Spider Pierre again. Pierre runs up the side of a building this time, and the Inspector tries to do so at first himself, but falls down. Undeterred again, he comes back with plungers on his feet, and starts running up the building after him. However, Pierre opens a window in the Inspector\'s path, and he falls into a woman\'s apartment, who screams and chases him out, accusing him of being a peeping Tom, then hits him over the head with a broom. When the Inspector hits the ground, he lands on the plungers, then springs back up to the woman, who hits him again. This keeps repeating, and as Deux-Deux watches, he says, "Well, that\'s cop biz for you. It has its ups, and downs." Finally, Deux-Deux faces Spider Pierre directly and threatens to "let him have it" if he doesn\'t surrender. This prompts Pierre to laugh uncontrollably, and Deux-Deux blasts him with DDT and subdues him. Later in prison, we see that not only is Spider Pierre in there, so is the Inspector, apparently for having counterfeit money on him, as the money he borrowed from Deux-Deux was his child\'s play money.'] ['Krazy Kat and his spaniel sweetheart are cowpokes. They were riding on a horse and kissing each other. On the way, they found a flyer on a post, promoting a rodeo event which offers considerable prize money. The spaniel ask Krazy to register but the feline was pretty timid at first. When the spaniel flirts him, Krazy was flattered and became obliged to try his luck. Krazy enters the venue and meets up with the other contestants. The other contestants laughed at him because of his short stature but Krazy kept his cool. After a few moments, the games begun and the first challenge involves taming a bodacious bronco. The first two competitors gave their shot respectively but they both only lasted a dozen seconds. Finally, Krazy receives his turn to the field. Because of his lack of rodeo background, however, Krazy was often running away while the bronco chases him all over the place. Watching in stands and fearing for her boyfriend\'s life, the spaniel tosses a lasso around the surging steed, stopping it in place. The bronco, not realizing what was going on, thought it was under a spell implemented by the cat. Capitalizing on the opportunity, Krazy then helds out and vibrates his paws, attempting to use hypnosis even though he does not actually possess such ability. Nevertheless, the naive bronco, still paranoid about the "spell," obeys the cat\'s command and went tap dancing. This was a victory for Krazy. Following the challenge with the bronco, other acts just for entertainment took center stage. First a trio of colts danced in the field. Next, Krazy exhibits moves with a lariat, and some pintos momentarily took part in his performance. Then came the final challenge where Krazy encounters a fierce bull. Once more, the cat tries to apply hypnotism. Recalling what seemingly happened to the bronco, the bull actually believed Krazy can control minds, thus taking the feline\'s order to do a ballet. In this, Krazy was declared winner of the event, and the spectators were delighted. After collecting his prize money in two cash bags, Krazy boards his own horse. He then came to the stands and approached his sweetheart. The spaniel was amazed by how things turned out, and affectionately asks Krazy to carry her along. Krazy picks up his canine girlfriend and puts her on his lap. The two set off in the horse and run into the horizon.'] ["In the winter of 1941, the attack on Pearl Harbor throws the United States into a turmoil of paranoia and racism.

The crimes, here corrected for Elmer\'s rounded-l-and-r speech, are listed below: "Resisting an officer, assault and battery, trespassing, disturbing the peace, miscellaneous misdemeanors, public nuisance, traffic violations, going through a boulevard stop, jaywalking, triple parking, conduct unbecoming to a rabbit", and "violating traffic regulations". As a result of these accusations, Bugs is a wanted rabbit, chased across the snow-packed tundra of Canada by Elmer. Elmer tries to get Bugs out of his burrow, but instead of getting Bugs in the handcuffs, he gets a bomb and frantically searches for his keys. Bugs then looks for the handcuff key while going through keys to "the garage, the car, the front door, Bugs then whistles to the audience "woo woo!", and the back door", and finally has the key, but Elmer blows up off-screen, and as Bugs tells the audience "Oh, well", Elmer finally catches him but Bugs distracts Elmer by wearing his hat and impersonating a Mountie and telling Elmer, "Attention! Why, look at you! You call yourself a Mountie? You\'re a disgrace to the regiment! I\'m gonna drop you out of the service!" as he inspects Elmer and before he tears Elmer\'s uniform off. When Elmer realizes he\'s been tricked, he gives chase. A chase scene involves a path completely under the snow that ends when Elmer crashes into a pine tree. The impact causes all the snow to fall off the tree, which reveals Christmas decorations, and Elmer emerges from underneath with snow on his face that gives him a Santa Claus appearance. The song Jingle Bells plays in the background, and Bugs says to the astonished Elmer: "Merry Christmas, Santy!". When Elmer finds Bugs, Bugs is seen taunting a snowman that looks exactly like him by saying, "So you call yourself a Mountie! Heh heh heh heh! You can\'t catch me. Why, you couldn\'t even catch a cold! You know what I\'m going to do to you? I\'m gonna punch ya right square in the nose!" and punches Elmer right in the nose when Elmer stands right behind Bugs, causing Elmer to crash into a tree behind him and reveal a heart with arrow stuck in it. After some more hijinks, Bugs offers to be turned in after a weeping Elmer Fudd labels himself as a "disgwace to the wegiment" for failing to catch the resourceful rabbit. Standing before an execution squad, Elmer asks Bugs if he has a last request, which prompts to Bugs break out into "I Wish I Was in Dixie". The scene then transitions into a Minstrel show/blackface gag set down south, where Elmer, Bugs and the mounties performs the chorus of "Camptown Races'] ['Harold works in an office on a tall building next to his girlfriend Mildred . He assumes they will be married, but overhears her talking to a man who says to her, "Of course I will marry you." Distraught, he decides to commit suicide, blindfolding himself and setting up a gun which will fire when he pulls a string attached to the trigger. But after putting on the blindfold he accidentally knocks over a bulb which pops, and he assumes he has shot himself. At that moment, a girder from the next door construction site swings into his office, lifting him and his chair outside. Pulling off the blindfold, the first thing he sees is a sculpture high on his building which he takes to be an angel, and he assumes he is in Heaven. However a jazz band on an adjacent rooftop garden soon disabuses him of that notion, and he realises he is high above the city. After several perilous escapades high on the construction site, he finally makes it to the ground, only to realise that the man Mildred was talking to was her clergyman brother, who has agreed to officiate at their wedding.'] ["Dolly was an orphan and poor as a church rat.

What unfolds is unbelievable."] ['The beginning of the special introduces the Coal Elf Brigade, a special unit of Christmas elves that is responsible for delivering lumps of coal to naughty children. While seeming cruel to some, the brigade adds small, encouraging notes to the lumps such as "Try Harder next year," in an attempt to steer the children back to the nice list. With the Big 2-5 fast approaching, Wayne and Lanny must race to recover classified North Pole technology that has fallen into the hands of a hacker identified only as "jinglesmell1337." Desperate to prevent Christmas from descending into chaos, Wayne seeks out  the foremost Naughty Kid expert to aid in the mission, a bombastic member of the Coal Elf Brigade who also happens to be his estranged younger  brother, Noel. Reluctant to take the extroverted Noel along with him, Wayne relents, and Noel joins the Prep & Landing team on the mission. During the trip, Noel and Wayne reminisce about their childhood, when they worked together far better than they do now. As the trio arrives at the hacker\'s house, Wayne sets off a booby trap, imperiling the entire team; Wayne takes a particular beating while Noel is able to defend himself. Lanny, however, is able to infiltrate the hacker\'s room, only to be taken captive . The hacker then reveals herself to be Grace Goodwin, whose sole mission is to get herself off the naughty list, believing that she had been set up by her toddler brother, who had destroyed her favorite toy and ruined her chances to ask Santa for a new one by his crying. After a somewhat intoxicated Lanny suggests using the "magic word" to get the password for the device that will get her off the list, she does just that: using the word "please" as the password, since genuinely naughty kids never say "please." At first, she appears successful in changing her status from naughty to nice, but the device malfunctions, threatening to place the entire planet on the naughty list unless she and the team can pull off a risky operation to fix the problem. Meanwhile, Wayne is particularly bitter at being "shown up" by his younger brother, prompting a fight in the street in front of Grace\'s house in which Wayne wishes he never had a brother. Shocked at his statement, Noel  asks Wayne to say he didn\'t mean it, then throws what he had intended to give Wayne as a Christmas present at him. The gift --a toy sled that Wayne had wanted as a boy but was never able to get-- prompts Wayne to reconcile with Noel and carry out the mission. Grace, watching the whole argument as it unfolds, learns a powerful lesson and a newfound appreciation for her younger brother. The next morning, the scene at the Goodwin house shows Grace\'s toddler brother giving her her new Christmas present, a replacement toy for the one he had destroyed a year prior. Meanwhile, back at the North Pole, Wayne and Noel both win the title of "Elves of the Year" for their efforts and cooperation.'] ['{{Plot}} This cartoon is fairly simple, involving various antics that Jerry  pulls on Tom during his sleep and Jerry\'s subsequent efforts to stop them by staying awake. Tom is having his beauty sleep during the wee hours. 1:59 AM: Jerry sleepwalks out of his hole and pulls Tom\'s whiskers such that they align themselves on one side of his face. Tom wakes up in puzzlement and pushes his whiskers back to even lengths. He spots Jerry and holds him down with one finger and crouches angrily in front of the mouse. Jerry punches his jaw such that his lips cover Tom\'s face. Jerry laughs and walks away. Tom snaps his fingers and wakes Jerry up. Jerry turns around slowly in a "hypnotic" way and Tom flips his head such that it twists incessantly like an exercise wheel. Tom then hits him into his hole with a pool cue. Jerry recovers from running into his own wall and cluelessly shrugs. 2:25 AM: Jerry walks out and pulls Tom\'s tail so that it transforms into an umbrella. Tom wakes up, folds his tail back up, and starts to chase after Jerry, but his tail unfolds back into umbrella-form. Jerry laughs in the same banal-sounding voice used earlier and is woken up a second time. Tom angrily picks him up and ties him up with string. Tom unwinds the string and Jerry is thrown around the room like a top, bouncing off legs of chairs and walls in a way similar to his previous humiliation, and then falls into his hole, completely exhausted. 3:07 AM: Jerry walks out with a steak knife in order to start stabbing the cat, but sneezes and wakes up. Jerry gasps and guiltily returns the knife to his hole. 3:26 AM: Following from the previous sleepwalk mishap, Jerry gulps 11 or more cups of coffee in an attempt to stay awake. Jerry sits on a spool and his features droop, but he shakes them off twice. Jerry tries to open his eyelids, but they close all by themselves. He shakes this off, then dozes off and gets back up again, but his features droop a third time and he cannot keep from entering the world of dreams. Jerry then walks out and throws a brick at the cat, but sneezes and wakes up a second time. Jerry gasps in fear and opens the cat\'s eyes. Tom sees the brick coming straight at him, opens his mouth in panic, and thus swallows the red brick. Jerry waves at him and Tom throws him back into his hole and boards it up. 3:40 AM: Jerry pushes all 4 nails off the board covering his hole and opens it up. He is carrying a ball of yarn. Jerry ties one end to Tom\'s tail, spreads the yarn around the entire house and outside as well. Then, he ties the other end to an anvil and pushes it down the chimney. Tom is woken up with a start and is pulled around the house, squeezed through the tiniest gaps, and pulled up to the chimney before hitting his head on the anvil at the bottom of the chimney. The camera flips over and Tom cries and packs up. He leaves in the morning, where he is sweating to the Egyptian brim. Jerry follows, but he is still sleepwalking.'] ['The story is based on the legend of the Invisible City of Kitezh , which disappears under the waters of a lake to escape an attack by the Mongols.  The film itself follows the legend only loosely, however, and its highpoint is a battle between the Russian soldiers and the Mongol hordes, symbolizing a clash of cultures .'] ['The film opens with an explosion at the far end of a subway. From the point of the explosion, we see a black car speeding towards the screen; it stops as the camera circles to show the route has been cut off by police vehicles. Out of breath, the silhouetted man takes off his dog tag and looks at a black gun lying in the passenger seat beside him. The screen fades to the title. After the introduction the movie opens with NSA Special Agent Darris Cain  in an elevator that is going to "Level One" of a military prison as radio chatter says "...we think it\'s starting again, have we got an inmate down there by the name of Dean Ellis?". Cain is there to interrogate the reluctant and taunting witness with a mouth injury, Dean Ellis . Evidence gathered through surveillance shows Ellis meeting with an elusive fugitive  whom Cain has been tracking around the world. The only lead is Ellis and a notebook with the words "Prey Alone" written in it, which was in Ellis\'s personal effects. Cain tries to extract information about the fugitive, only to be stymied by Ellis\'s laugh and taunts. Ellis prods Cain to think about what is happening, and hints that this event is happening over and over, like a déjà vu event. Soon, Cain realizes "Prey Alone" is actually a phone number and leaves to coordinate an attempt to capture the fugitive. The phone number is tracked to a cell phone located in a room in a nondescript building in the city and forces are mobilized. A watch on both the fugitive and Cain\'s wrists start counting down from 10:00 minutes. As a SWAT team is about to break into the room, the fugitive sets off an explosive that was placed on the door by the SWAT team. All of the team except for one member is killed or rendered harmless. The fugitive escapes the room after the explosion and shoots the last one in the back of the head. A second SWAT team stands by at the elevator of the building. They see the floor numbers counting down and ready their automatic weapons. The elevator opens and nobody seems to be inside. The team enters the elevator and peers up, only to see a hole in the roof and a grenade coming down that hole. The grenade explodes and the team is incapacitated. The rest of the force attempts to seal the building, but the fugitive escapes in a black car. He sets off in a high-speed chase down the highway with the police in multiple cars and a helicopter chasing after him. He shoots one police car and disables it, which blocks the highway for the rest of the cars. Then, the fugitive shoots at the helicopter and kills the pilots. Some military personnel that are present in the control room where Cain is located urge Cain to back off. He declines and orders a technician to call up a nearby Andrews Air Force Base and tell them to send in two aircraft to chase the car. Cain reenters the interrogation room where Ellis is still being held. Ellis laughs at Cain, and gets punched in the mouth. Cain tries to get Ellis to tell him where the fugitive is running to, but Ellis indicates that the fugitive is not running. Again, Ellis prods Cain to think, and Cain finally realizes this is a recurring event. He connects the pain in Ellis\'s mouth to the punch that he just delivered. With this piece of information, Cain realizes that he knows where the fugitive is going because it is all happening again. The fugitive is heading to an incomplete subway. Cain tries to get the aircraft to pull out, but it is too late and they disappear off the radar screen. Cain pulls up a map of the subway and orders reinforcements to seal off certain tunnels. The aircraft have entered into the tunnel, which is the reason why they disappeared off the radar screen. One of the jets is hit and is forced to fly off the main tunnel and into another one. It eventually crashes into a wall. The second airplane is able to arm and lock a missile. The fugitive attempts evasive maneuvers in his car to try to throw the missile off and is successful. The missile continues flying and tries to reacquire a target. It does so, but it targets the second jet. The jet is hit and destroyed.  The fugitive begins to exit the tunnel, but stops abruptly when he sees a police force blocking his way. It becomes clear that the fugitive was the silhouetted man at the beginning, and is once again trapped in the tunnel. Cain shows up in a helicopter with a line of other SWAT officers and they tell the fugitive to surrender. The fugitive speeds towards the SWAT officers but stops when they open fire. Cain and the officers walk over to the car only to find dog tags that say "Player One." On the ground is a traffic marker that says "End of Level One." Cain looks at his watch and as the seconds count down to 0:00, Cain realizes that this is all a game. At 0:00, the words "Game Over" flash momentarily on the screen. Once again we see Cain in an elevator as the voices over the radio say "we think it\'s starting again". The movie ends as Cain walks by the same sign from the beginning stating "You are now entering...Level One."'] ['This short tells the story of the pencil tool escaping from the Macintosh interface, then attempting to get back onto the screen.'] ["Jackie is hopelessly in love with Miss Crabtree.

Dr. Atom  then explains the similarities between the solar system and atomic structure. He then goes on to relate how the atom is made up of protons, neutrons, and electrons. After this, the narrator explains how there are more than 90 elements with many possible isotopes for each.

The girl beagle plays the piano while Oswald dances on top of it and sings the song It Ain't Gonna Rain No Mo'. Taking the idea too literally, the boy beagle throws a set of umbrellas out the window, much to Oswald's annoyance. They then notice water dripping from the ceiling pipe of a nearby room. To check the problem, the boy beagle brings a ladder and Oswald climbs. Thinking of it more fun to create mischief than to help his friend, however, the boy beagle kicks and knocks down the ladder. Thus Oswald grabs and hangs onto the ceiling pipe which is very brittle. As a result the pipe breaks, and large quantities of water pour in and flood the house. The girl beagle was frightened by this and therefore takes shelter inside a grandfather clock. After the clock was submerged, she tries to come out but could not because of the enormous pressure exerted by the flood. Oswald then comes and tries to bail her out. Enjoying the flooded indoors, the boy beagle rides on a tub and releases four fishes. Upon reaching Oswald who is still trying to free the other beagle still in the clock, he pulls the rabbit's shorts with a fishing rod and tosses a biscuit inside. The fishes aggressively go in, and Oswald is disturbed. Having enough disturbance, Oswald scares the fishes away but a giant marlin didn't take his gesture too kindly. The marlin began wrestling Oswald as well as stinging him with its pointed nose. When the marlin's attack suddenly misses Oswald, its nose strikes a wall instead, causing the big fish to become stuck and incapacitated. Oswald uses this as an opportunity to hit back. Following a few moments, the marlin was able to break loose but without its nose which remained stuck to the wall. Being on the marlin's side, however, the treacherous boy beagle gives the big fish a saw. In an attempt to put Oswald in much bigger trouble, the marlin saws a hole in the floor which starts to drain the water and anything nearby. This move, however, backfired as the marlin and the boy beagle were pulled into the opening. Fortunately, Oswald was able to keep himself in place until all the water disappears. The girl beagle finally comes out of the clock and embraces her boyfriend."] ["As a street painter paints out a white line in the middle of a road, Penelope is being chased by a dog and runs right under the paint tank and getting a white line across her spine whilst the dog crashes into the tank and painter.

They laze around eating Chinese food while Pa Grape introduces the "Astonishing Contraption of Silliness". Pa Grape pushes them into action and they feed the votes into the Contraption, which sputters and begins presenting the Top 10 Silly Songs of All Time. The Contraption malfunctions halfway through the countdown, producing nonsense such as "The Dance of the Yodeling Cebu Lips" and "The Song of the Water-Buffalo who don\'t love Cebu with yodeling lips", forcing Larry and Mr. Lunt to come up with a song of their own.

There, he seems intent - and possibly even driven to insanity -with catching the doodlebug of the film's title. However, after over two minutes of cat-and-mouse chasing, it is revealed that the bug resembles a miniature version of himself. He squashes the bug with his shoe. The audience comes to realise that every move that the doodlebug makes the man reciprocates a second later. Into this Kafkaesque situation enters a large face, that of the man; thereby making the man the doodlebug, and he proceeds to get squashed by this newer being."] ['Introduction: The usual chase starts for a few seconds until it stops for the  Latin names: Ultra-sonicus Ad Infinitum and Nemesis Ridiculii, plus a "bonus" name for the Road Runner\'s beep: Beepius-beepius. The chase then moves around mountain corners until it ends on a mountainside, with the Road Runner ducking behind a corner and leaving a cloud of dust for the coyote to run into. Wile E. rides the dust cloud all the way through the air, and finally stops to determine where he is, a question mark appearing over his head. He opens a "door" in the cloud only to see that he is in midair, and sheepishly closes the door as the cloud disperses, and then changes his question mark of surprise to an exclamation point before the inexorable pull of gravity takes effect. 1. The pair pull up onto opposite outcroppings, and Wile E. attempts to pole-vault from his to his opponent\'s, but this causes the end of his outcropping to crumble and the coyote to fall down. Seeing his impending humiliation approaching, Wile E. attempts to make the best of it by climbing up the pole; however, he keeps falling back to the bottom of it. Eventually, the pole turns around so fast that it whirs like a propeller, and then grinds against a cliffside all the way down to the part Wile E. is holding. When it finally stops rotating, the coyote then pulls himself onto the narrow bar left of the pole and accepts his fate. 2. In a gag that sees four attempts in this cartoon, Wile E. sits on a rocket and lights the fuse, aiming towards the Road Runner on the opposite site of the chasm.  The first attempt fails when the fuel and nosecone launch out of the rocket, leaving Wile E. sitting on an empty hull. The hull crunches down, and then Wile falls, annoyed, to the canyon floor. 3. As the Road Runner burns rubber on the ground roads, Wile E. is pulling back on a falling safe attached to a rope and pulley. Eventually, however, the weight overcomes him and the coyote is pulled through the pulley, removing all of his chest fur, and then down onto a see-saw as the safe lands next to him. Wile then slides off the rock face to fall into the canyon a fourth time, and is then smashed by the safe, leaving the coyote\'s torso thin and flat. 4. The second attempt at the rocket is foiled when the rocket falls out of its aim towards the Road Runner and points directly downwards before it fires, leading to an extra-speedy fifth fall. 5. Now, Ross animates a sequence in which Wile E. sticks a firecracker into the center hole of a Frisbee  and throws it at his nemesis, but before he releases the disc, the firecracker drops out of the hole and sizzles at Wile E\'s foot. The coyote doesn\'t notice until he puts his foot down on the firework and instinctively pulls it away just before it explodes, leaving him dazed but apparently unhurt. Wile then walks away like Charlie Chaplin, revealing behind him that his tail is on fire, unknown to him until he passes the horizon and he yelps in pain! 6. On his third attempt with the rocket, he lights the fuse but it burns quickly and fires successfully out from under him before he could get ready and leaves Wile floating in midair with a cloud of dust blocking his view below. Unable to see what is below him, Wile pokes his foot through the cloud and consequently suffers gravity for the sixth time, as he holds up a sign stating "GOODBYE" and then flipping to "AGAIN".  7. To get the bird to stick, Wile leaves out a sheet of ACME Giant Fly Paper in the road and sits down on a rock, laughing at his "genius". He hears a braking noise, assumes the Road Runner has been caught, and leaps out to catch him, but instead of the Road Runner, he has caught an actual giant fly. The fly is very unhappy about being stuck on the paper and thus wraps the coyote with it, who tiptoes away from the scene. 8. On his final attempt at the skyrocket, Wile E. accidentally ignites his tail instead of the fuse, and detects his mistake and leaps up in pain only to smash his head on another outcropping. Fortunately, this causes him to return to the rocket and to light the fuse with his tail, and after it takes off is struggling briefly to get control then puts out the fire on his tail. Unfortunately, the rocket is off target, and it bores through the cliff under the Road Runner, who allows the coyote to be humiliated privately. The rocket finally explodes, blackening the coyote and throwing him back into the air. Displeased, Wile E. holds up a yellow sign asking "HOW DID I EVER GET INTO THIS LINE OF WORK?" before falling for a seventh time. 9. A new plan is formulated, where Wile E. attempts to blow up the Road Runner by pelting explosive tennis balls at him. The first ball seamlessly blows up a cactus with no issues , and the coyote is eager to try them at work. As luck would have it, the Road Runner is heard, and Wile is quick to lob another ball at him, but just misses, and the ball then drops onto the arm of a cactus, which throws it directly back to its owner. A little agitated, the coyote returns the ball, and this time it is caught by power lines and slung back out of Wile E.\'s reach. The ball pops directly back into its original slot in the box of balls as Wile E. arrives on the scene and takes stock. Sensing the coming explosions, Wile E. holds up a pair of signs: "For Sale One used Tennis Racket" and "CHEAP!" before  a "GIGANTIC EXPLOSION!" occurs. 10. The whole cartoon, however, is best known for its ending gag. Wile E. Coyote is chasing the Road Runner through a series of pipelines, which causes both of them to emerge in a greatly shrunken state. Upon discovering their situation, they agree to re-enter the pipeline and be transformed back into full size. The Road Runner emerges at normal size, but Wile is still in small size when he comes out. Upon discovering this turn of fortune, the Road Runner stops and allows his rival to "catch" him. The coyote doesn\'t notice anything until he steps over his opponent\'s feet and rushes back to finally "catch" the Road Runner. The coyote is ecstatic and pulls out his knife and fork to eat his opponent...until he stares more closely at the bird\'s huge legs, which are twice as tall as he is, and looks up to see he is massively outgunned. The Road Runner gives an amplified "beep-beep", causing Wile to drop his utensils in shock. He can only hold up signs to the audience stating, "Okay, wise guys, you always wanted me to catch him -" and "Now what do I do?". Well, That\'s all Folks!'] ['Dirk Diggler  was born as Steven Samuel Adams on April 15, 1961 outside of Saint Paul, Minnesota.

Tweety does the same . Tweety puts his binoculars down and says his catchphrase: “I tawt I taw a puddy tat!” Then he replaces his binoculars to confirm and, indeed, “I DID! I DID taw a puddy tat!” Sylvester jumps for joy and runs to the building Tweety is in , but fails to notice the sign banning cats and dogs from the building. This results in a confrontation with the guard just inside the door, who kicks Sylvester out. Next, Sylvester climbs up the drainpipe of the Broken Arms Apartment Building while Tweety sings the song "When Irish Eyes are Smiling". Behind Tweety and off-camera, Sylvester swings a paw in metronome rhythm to his “snack\'s” song. Only then does Tweety realize that Sylvester is watching him. He calls for help and jumps out of his cage; Sylvester chases him through the room. However, Tweety\'s owner, Granny is ready for him. She throws him out the window and, looking down on him, snarls: “Yeah that\'ll teach ya! Next time I\'ll give you what for!” Tweety joins in the scolding: “Bad ol\' puddy tat!” Sylvester paces around the door, then gets an idea: to climb up in the drainpipe. Instead of getting scared again, Tweety now drops a bowling ball into the drainpipe. The heavy ball collides with Sylvester – and he swallows it! He frantically attempts to stop himself from rolling into “Champin\'s Bowling Alley” , but to no avail. Sounds of bowling pins dropping emanate from said building. Now Sylvester attempts to come up with a new plan for consumption of Tweety. He then notices a street busker with a monkey across the street. He slips across the street and then, after luring the monkey away from his master with a banana, hits him  in the head and manages to pass himself off as said monkey to the busker. Tweety isn\'t fooled, though, realizing that: “OH! Here tum dat puddy tat adain!” Sylvester enters Granny\'s room chasing Tweety, but has to stop running after him outright when Granny notices him. He now tries  to surreptitiously look for and eat Tweety. His attempt to pass himself off as a monkey is ruined when Granny gives him a penny and he can\'t resist tipping his hat politely to her. Granny smacks him in the head with an umbrella and then exposes that she was actually fully aware that he was a deliberately intruding cat who wanted to eat her canary rather than a legitimately in-business monkey whose busker master was trying to make a living. Sylvester, who now has a lump on his head, staggers out of the room, tipping his hat at the angry Granny in the process. Next, Sylvester manages to gain access to the desk clerk\'s office undetected  and hears the telephone ring. Angrily, the desk clerk picks it up, but is professionally calm and polite when talking to Granny. Eavesdropping on them, Sylvester hears that Granny is checking out of Room 158, and that she wants someone to pick up Tweety and her luggage. This gives Sylvester the idea he wants: cut to a shot of Sylvester knocking on Granny\'s door. Granny opens it a crack and asks Sylvester what he\'s doing, to which Sylvester replies in his lisping voice: “Your bags, Madame.” Granny answers: “OK, they\'re behind the door. I\'ll see you in the lobby.” Sylvester enters Room 158 and picks up Granny\'s suitcases and Tweety\'s cage. He carries them all out into the hall, then discards the suitcase and carries the cage down the stairs to the rear of the apartment building. There, he walks into the alley and opens the cage, expecting to enjoy Tweety – but Granny is in the cage! She hits Sylvester with her umbrella several times in rapid succession . Next, Sylvester drags a box, a plank and a 500-pound weight to the point at the base of the apartment building that is in a direct vertical line with Tweety\'s window. He supports the plank with the box in the middle, stands on one end of the plank and heaves the weight onto the other end. This propels him up to Tweety\'s level and enables him to snatch the tiny bird. However, as he runs off, the weight lands hard on his head. Sylvester next tries to swing over to Tweety\'s window , and uses all manner of scientific methods to ensure that he doesn\'t let Tweety slip by him again. However, he misjudges something that forces him to crash into the wall next to the drainpipe. Tweety remarks that Sylvester will hurt himself more badly unless he\'s more careful. Finally, Sylvester\'s pacing stops quite abruptly when he notices the electric air cable wires over his head. He crosses the street, climbs the supporting pole and walks the wires across to the Broken Arms Apartment Building. However, Sylvester has to get out of the way when he hears the bell ringing to signal the approach of a trolley. His feet aren\'t quick enough to evade the trolley, and he is electrocuted several times as the trolley pursues him! The driver is shown to be: Tweety, who again says, “I tawt I taw a puddy tat!” and Granny, who is sitting next to him, agrees with him: “You did, you DID! You DID taw a putty tat!”.

When they bring the horse to the painting\'s owner, he speaks to them from an upstairs window where he can\'t see the steed; he tells them to bring Blue Boy in the house and put "him" on the piano. This triggers a running gag where Ollie explains patiently to Stan that , the rich are different from you and me. He punctuates his lesson with a twisting gesture of his hand to demonstrate the 180-degree difference between the classes. The three come clumping through the front door while the millionaire upstairs takes a bath — "and it ain\'t even Saturday," a title card informs us. Ollie has an altercation with a nude statue, which snaps into three pieces after the two tumble to the floor; Hardy, ever the gentleman, safeguards the statue\'s modesty by wrapping its bare torso in his coat while he reassembles it. When the statue\'s back upright and Ollie removes the coat, the torso segment is backwards, so its backside protrudes out from where its midriff should be. Wrong again! Meanwhile, the suddenly obstreperous Blue Boy has taken to chasing Stanley around the house, while a cross-cut reveals that the police have recovered the Blue Boy painting and are making plans to return it. Working together, The Boys manage to lead the horse over to the grand piano, and up he leaps to his high perch. Shots of the millionaire upstairs in his tub reveal that he\'s at least hearing the commotion below. Things seem fine — Blue Boy is placidly up on the piano as his owner has asked — when suddenly a piano leg gives way and Ollie is left literally holding things up, about a ton of piano and horse. Stan rises to his usual degree of helpfulness as the horse, in a bravura performance, keeps nudging his derby off his head and Stan opts to keep retrieving the hat rather than help with the crisis at hand. They finally get the piano leg wedged back under the instrument, but not before Ollie\'s head gets squished between the two. The three agents of The Boys\' undoing all then converge in a perfect storm of bad luck: the millionaire\'s mother returns home , the police arrive with the real Blue Boy, the recovered painting, and the refreshed millionaire descends from his bath to reveal the misunderstanding. Ollie twiddles his tie, apologies for the "faux pas" and he and Stan and Blue Boy make a hasty exit, followed by the irate millionaire with a shotgun. In the process, the priceless painting gets knocked to the floor on top of one of the detectives, whose face pops through the canvas in the exact right spot, replacing Blue Boy\'s face. The short ends with a favorite Roach finale — a gag at the expense of a cop. This one has the officer as the literal butt of the joke: his rump is still smoking from the pellets delivered by the millionaire\'s shotgun.'] ['Two lovers, Knock Knock  and Who\'s There  confront their difficulties communicating with each other by telling knock knock jokes.

A small fight breaks out between Ollie and Stan as a result of Ollie trying to keep Stan from putting his hat on inside the house. After the wife of the household inspects them she gets shown a notice apologizing that the only available waiters were the duo, where it is revealed on the paper that their previous experience in waiting was at railroad eating houses. Ollie comments to the wife's husband that she is “some wiggler!”  and naturally, the husband isn't impressed. The pair get ready to start work in the kitchen where Stan tells the chef  not to wear his hat. Stan takes it off him several times but the chef proceeds to keep putting it back on. Stan soon loses his cool and throws the chefs hat away. The chef retaliates by grabbing the nearest plate and smashing it over Stan's head. Stan does the same back to the chef and they carry on using plates as weapons until Ollie calms things down by stopping Stan from destroying a large, expensive looking plate. However, as Ollie walks off, he trips on the kitchen floor and smashes the plate, causing him to be embarrassed by the onlooking maid. Meanwhile the party goes on, oblivious to the impending disaster awaiting them. The wife of the household isn't having an easy time either, as she struggles to eat her fruit cocktail with the cutlery provided. Her predicament carries on throughout the film. Stan and Ollie come into the room as they are about to start serving food. Stan manages to pour, what looks like soup, onto Ollie's foot while he counts the guests. Ollie begins carrying a very large cake to the table but slips on a banana skin left by the family dog and lands head first into the cake. Ollie manages to do this more than once in the film, much to the bemusement of the guests, and of Stan, who accuses him of falling over on purpose at one point.

A subculture has grown surrounding the video: people wait to see how close to the seven-day deadline they can get. When they grow too afraid to go on any longer, they show the tape to the next assigned person. During the interval, some create videos documenting their experiences to be posted to websites devoted to the videotape phenomenon. Groups that have watched the video are called "rings".

In this case, the story concerns a small airplane taking its passengers on a world tour. Some excerpts: *The plane, as well as its shadow, are remarkably flexible. The plane takes off like a bird, running and jumping and flapping its wings. The plane\'s shadow, seen from above, dodges ground-level obstacles. *The plane passes Mount Rushmore, which is seen to include the two major candidates from the 1940 election, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Wendell Wilkie. *In Ireland, an Irish tenor sings "When Irish Eyes Are Smiling", while a  stray hair keeps appearing in the frame, as if stuck in the projector. The Irishman abruptly stops singing and yells at the top of his lungs to the projectionist, "Hey, you, up there! Get that hair out of here!" (This joke was later reused in Avery\'s cartoon Magical Maestro . *In "Darkest Africa", natives are listening to jungle drumbeats which are used for communication. One native asks another what the drums are saying, and the second native , responds, "Boop-ditty, boop-ditty, boop-boop-de-boop!" *Also in Africa, a native is using a blowgun, and is revealed that he was merely aiming at a practice target. His target calls him a "terrible shot". *A group of ostriches hide their heads in the sand. Another ostrich arrives, perplexed, wondering where everyone went. *A series of cocoons opens up, all of them producing beautiful butterflies, except for a weak and scrawny one: "Well, I\'ve been sick!" *The cartoon ends with the plane lost in fog while returning to New York City. When the fog finally clears, the plane is discovered to be attached to a carousel ride, and as it circles, "The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down" is playing. In this unique instance for a WB cartoon, the Looney Tunes theme segués into the Merrie Melodies theme at iris-out.'] ['A madman breaks into a house with a chainsaw and kills a group of teenagers.Chainsaw Scumfuck - Filmtipset It was inspired by The Texas Chain Saw Massacre.'] ['The children live in the Bleak Hill boarding school, where they are yelled at, punished, and browbeaten by the ghastly old headmistress.

In school, however, they are taught by the headmistress\'s husband, the gentle and lovable Old Cap, who runs the school in an informal manner. Cap wants to do something nice for the children, since their school meals usually consist of mush and milk. Just as the headmistress leaves the boys\' sleeping quarters Old Cap comes in to say hi to them. At that time, he promises that when he gets his back pension they will all leave that place and live well with tons of presents for the children. After the boys are up the headmistress tells the boys to milk the cow and that they will be thrashed if they spill any. They spill the milk and use plaster of paris to substitute the milk.

The Coyote passes him and stops in a cloud of dust. The Road Runner then zips into the distance with the force lifting the ribbon of pavement off the ground in his wake. Wile E. lowers his expectations  and thinks of a new scheme. The gags are as follows: 1. The Coyote, on a cliff, drops a washtub on the Road Runner on the road below, jumps on it and puts a stick of dynamite underneath it. The Road Runner zips up to him. The Coyote goes under the washtub to investigate why the bird isn\'t there and the dynamite blows up, encasing the Coyote in a tube made from the washtub. 2. The Coyote hides around a corner to bash the Road Runner with a sledgehammer. But the hammer falls off and the stick bashes the Coyote and chases him into the distance. 3. Birdseed is place on some railroad tracks but a train runs down the Coyote before he can get off the railroad. 4. Attached to a green balloon, the Coyote carrying a harpoon jumps off a cliff, tied to a rope. He misses the Road Runner, but the force carries him into a storm cloud. The harpoon attracts lightning which zaps the Coyote . 5. A bundle of dynamite is unrolled from its wires toward a short underpass beneath the road. But thick rolled up wires that have just been unrolled tend to have memory, so the bundle starts to move, then rolls back up to the Coyote\'s hiding spot before he gets back there and notices, and one push of the plunger blows him up. 6. Using a rope and a pulley, the Coyote raises a baby grand piano high above the road. As the Road Runner passes, the Coyote lets go of the rope, which sticks in the pulley. The Coyote jumps on top of the piano, which loosens the rope and causes the piano - and the Coyote - to drop to the ground. Dazed, the Coyote opens his mouth to reveal that the piano keys are now his teeth; he plays "Taps" on them briefly before passing out. 7. An elaborate Rube Goldberg-type gag ends the cartoon. The Coyote uses a tiny slingshot to knock loose a stick holding up a watering can suspended on a wooden yardarm. The can tips and water pours onto a plant which has a wooden match attached to it. The plant grows and the match strikes against a rock and lights a stick of dynamite. On top of the dynamite is a boot with a brick in it. The blast sends the boot ontop of a teeter board, which rises and releases a mouse in a cage at the other end. The mouse runs to grab a piece of cheese on a scale. A weight on the other end of the scale falls, pulling the trigger on a rifle attached to a cliff. A bullet from the rifle ricochets off two metal bullseyes and knocks down an upright cannon. The wick on the cannon is lit by a nearby candle, which fires a ball that goes through two funnels and plummets on top of the unsuspecting coyote. After the coyote is bashed into the ground, \'The End\' appears on the cannon ball. The title is a pun on the title Hook, Line and Sinker.'] ['The cartoon focuses on a Donkey, a Dog, a Cat, and a Rooster and their master Troubadour , all of whom are voiced by Oleg Anofriyev, with the exception of the Donkey, who is voiced by Anatoli Gorokhov.

Daffy visits Elmer Fudd at his house and says that Acme has authorized him to install, at no cost, a complete line of ultra-modern automatic household appliances . Elmer tries to speak but is repeatedly interrupted by Daffy, who grabs Elmer by the arm and escorts him to a bus to take him to the office. Despite Elmer\'s protests , Daffy puts him on the bus, which unknown to Elmer has a sign on the back that reads "Duluth Express Non-Stop". Later that day, Elmer returns to his house . Daffy greets Elmer at the front door and welcomes him to his new future-antic push button home. Elmer sees that his house is different and asks Daffy what he\'s done, but Daffy quickly pushes a button and a machine removes Elmer\'s hat and coat. Daffy then guides Elmer to a massaging chair. Elmer likes it at first, but Daffy pushes a button and Elmer receives an aggressive massage, which dazes him. The chair then automatically puts a cigar in Elmer\'s mouth and lights it, but the smoke activates a robot fire extinguisher from another room which douses Elmer with a bucket of water. Daffy states "It\'s, uh, very sensitive to heat. Probably needs adjusting", then guides Elmer into the kitchen. Daffy encourages Elmer to bask in the kitchen\'s "treasure trove of work-saving appliances" and demonstrates a new knife sharpener which ends up destroying the blade on one of Elmer\'s knives. Undaunted, Daffy points out the garbage disposal, which is revealed to be a pig which is housed under the kitchen sink . Daffy then shows Elmer the "main control panel" which operates all of the new appliances. Daffy suggests what Elmer would do if the walls were dirty. Elmer simply says that he would scrub them, though Daffy pushes a button marked "Wall Cleaner" and a robotic device emerges to clean the walls but it removes Elmer\'s wallpaper instead . Daffy tries to adjust the device but he adjusts it the wrong way and it starts removing the plaster . Daffy quickly deactivates it, then asks Elmer if he is tired of looking at his dirty windows, and when Elmer says "Well, I...", Daffy summons a machine which covers Elmer\'s window with bricks, and says that he\'ll "never have to looks at those dirty windows again". Elmer becomes angry, telling Daffy that "he\'s so angwy, he\'s burning up!" which again activates the fire extinguisher and Elmer is doused with another bucket of water . Daffy tries to continue the demonstration, but Elmer objects, saying that something bad happens to him whenever Daffy pushes a button. So Daffy agrees to let Elmer push a button. Elmer spots one, saying in his distinct voice, "I think I\'ll push this wed one." Daffy stops Elmer, shouting, "No, no, no, no, no! Not the WED one! Don\'t EVER push the WED one!" Elmer pushes another button that reads "Burglar Alarm"  and a mechanical dog comes out of the wall and bites him. Daffy then takes Elmer into a bedroom and shows him a device which will automatically tie a neck tie . Daffy tries to demonstrate it but the machine puts Elmer in a noose . Daffy shuts off the machine and casually refers to the noose as the "Alcatraz Ascot" as if it were a type of neck tie . Elmer is exhausted, telling Daffy that he wants all of the "push-button nonsense" removed and tries to go upstairs and take an aspirin, but cannot do so because his stairway has been removed. Daffy confidently boasts that there is no need to walk up stairs in a push-button home, and uses an elevator-like device to bring the "upstairs  downstairs". Elmer seems impressed but asks what happens to the downstairs, and Daffy  raises the upstairs which shows that everything downstairs has been destroyed. Elmer asks if there is "any more cwever gadgets to demonstwate, Mr. Smarty Salesman?", and when Daffy says no, Elmer makes a phone call but the conversation is inaudible. When Elmer hangs up there is a knock on his front door and a large crate is brought inside. Elmer opens the crate and starts the motor, telling Daffy about his new "future-antic push-button salesman ejector" which grabs Daffy by the shoulders and wheels him out of the house, kicking him repeatedly . With Daffy gone, Elmer remembers the red button and wonders "what that wed button is for?" He pushes it and a display reads "IN CASE OF TIDAL WAVE". A hydraulic lift raises his house high into the air. Elmer looks out of the front door and Daffy flies by in a helicopter and delivers the final punch line, "For a small price, I can install this little blue button to get you down!".'] ['Raouf spends his days racing against time, trying to make a little money, and playing power games with others, especially Nadia, his girlfriend… Memories and contemplation are also part of his daily life.'] ['At Last, Okemah! is a comedic retelling of Don Quixote featuring Jeff-nominated actor Kevin Viol in the lead role of Winston Thomas, a former hipster who becomes the self-styled greatest, most authentic folk singer of all time.

It centers on Giovanni Auditore, the father of the game\'s main character, Ezio Auditore da Firenze. Giovanni is an Assassin living in 15th-century Italy during the Renaissance. At this dawn of a new era, a conspiracy is being plotted by one corrupt family to overthrow the powerful Medici family and destroy a unified Italy. As an Assassin, Giovanni must face this threat and bring the guilty parties to justice. The story introduces the situation before Assassin\'s Creed II, and the enemies of both Giovanni and his son Ezio.  {{Assassin\'s Creed chronology}} ;Episode 1 In the city of Florence in 1476, the Assassin Giovanni Auditore monologues on how, hidden behind the enlightenment of the Renaissance, corruption, betrayal and murder are rife, but that in order to preserve justice, honor and the safety of his family, he will fight. From the shadows, he quietly watches his family enjoying themselves at dinner, before departing into the moonlit streets of Florence. Outside, he ambushes a party of mercenaries led by Rodrigo Borgia as they attempt to sneak out of the city under cover of darkness. Giovanni is able to kill two of the mercenaries and incapacitate the third, but Borgia escapes in the confusion. Giovanni brings the injured man to his master, Lorenzo de\' Medici, and warns Lorenzo that he has heard rumors of an approaching event that will trigger a shift in power. Lorenzo has the captive interrogated; under torture on the rack, the prisoner confesses that in the city of Milan, on the day after Christmas, the Duke of Milan will be assassinated during the Feast of St Stephen, when the church bell strikes for the twelfth and final time. Giovanni races to Milan and finds the Duke at Mass in church, but is unable to intervene before the Duke is killed. The murderers are swiftly dispatched by the Duke\'s guards and Giovanni himself; however, Giovanni\'s efforts to try to subdue one of the killers for interrogation fail, as the guard kills the last assassin. Giovanni searches the body of one of the killers, finding a purse of gold coins stamped with the coat of arms of Venice. Returning home, Giovanni watches his elder sons play chess, advising his younger son Ezio on how to become a better player. In private, he monologues that the Duke of Milan\'s death has robbed Medici of a powerful ally, and that even now, his enemies will be plotting their next move. However, he now knows where to find them... ;Episode 2 Giovanni arrives in Venice to investigate the possibility that whoever ordered the Duke of Milan\'s assassination is hiding in the city. His investigations lead him to St Mark\'s Basilica and the Doge\'s Palace, where, after killing a guard to cover his tracks, he eavesdrops on a group of men  conversing in a nearby room. He sees them dispatch a courier carrying a letter for \'their master\' in Rome, insisting its delivery is of great importance. Giovanni tracks and intercepts the courier in Venice\'s back alleys; after a lengthy fight, Giovanni overpowers the courier and tries to interrogate him, but the courier refuses to talk, and kills himself on Giovanni\'s blade. Furious, Giovanni takes the letter, which bears the seal of the Barbarigo family, and returns to Florence. Back in Florence, Giovanni presents the letter to Lorenzo de\' Medici: however, it is encrypted, written in a strange code. Lorenzo\'s aide, the Gonfaloniere of Justice Uberto Alberti states it will take some time to decode, and sends Giovanni home to get some rest, promising to call him when it is done. A priest in Medici\'s service  translates the letter and presents it to Uberto, who tells Fr. Maffei to summon Giovanni and Lorenzo, but warns him to tell no one of the letter\'s contents. Back at his villa, Giovanni enjoys some time with his wife and family, before being summoned by Maffei to the palace. His son Ezio is confused as to why his father must leave so late in the night, and asks to go with him, but Giovanni refuses. At the palace, Uberto claims they were unable to translate the letter, and therefore the only way to see who it is intended for is to take it to Rome and deliver it personally. In spite of the danger, Giovanni volunteers to take it; Lorenzo instructs him to find his enemies... and show no mercy. Back in Venice, the Barbarigos, with Rodrigo Borgia at their head, pray "May The Father of Understanding be with us!"  and prepare themselves for battle, arranging their swords in a familiar symbol. ;Episode 3 Giovanni arrives in Rome and delivers the letter as ordered, which is passed through the crowd until it reaches Borgia; Borgia goes straight to the Vatican, where he delivers the letter to Pope Sixtus IV. The pair discuss the fact that Lorenzo de\' Medici is unwilling to bend to the Pope\'s authority; when Borgia suggests he could use force, the Pope agrees to lend his spiritual support and military aid to an endeavour to restore order in Florence. When Borgia leaves, he is followed by Giovanni, but he manages to give Giovanni the slip, and disappears into St Peter\'s Basilica. As Giovanni investigates inside, he is confronted by Borgia, who addresses him by name and remarks that what follows next is of his making. He appreciates that Giovanni\'s skills would be of much use to the Templar cause, and that if Giovanni joins them, he will live to see \'a new world\'. When Giovanni refuses, and remarks the only way this will end is with an Assassin\'s blade in Borgia\'s throat, Borgia sneers "We shall see!", and orders his men to attack. Giovanni fights bravely and defeats his attackers, but is struck in the chest with a throwing knife by Borgia, and his hidden blade is broken. Though he survives, Borgia uses the distraction to escape. Badly wounded, Giovanni returns home to Florence, where his wife tends to his wounds. He confesses to her his fear that the Duke of Milan\'s assassination was merely the start of a conspiracy, and that the next blow will strike Florence; he fears for the safety of de\'Medici, his allies and himself. Suddenly, Father Antonio Maffei, along with some armed men of the city guard, arrive at the house, asking for Giovanni. Giovanni has his elder son Federico tell the guards he has already left, then escapes through a hidden passage. Back in Rome, Borgia and his fellow Templars agree that the main threat to their plans is Giovanni; however, Borgia says he has a plan to deal with the Assassin, and that with him gone, nothing will stand in their way. Back in Florence, Giovanni prowls the streets , monologuing that dark days are approaching Florence and time is running out; the final battle is about to begin. He remarks that no matter what happens, he and his sons are "the Auditore da Firenze, and we are Assassins!" The film concludes with the message "The conclusion... is in your hands", setting the stage for Assassin\'s Creed II.'] ['Introduction: Wile E. Coyote is cooking some food in a tin bucket over a fire. He adds pepper and a drop of a brown liquid, and stirs the bucket and fishes out what is revealed to be a tin can. The Coyote then sits down on a rock and prepares to cut the can in half  before he realizes what he is eating, and then pushes the entire table setting off the rock table. "COYOTE - Eatibus Almost Anythingus". With a Beep-beep, the Roadrunner speeds by and throws the coyote rolling across the ground. The camera cuts to the Road Runner, who is currently a blur of motion, and freezes the clip temporarily to add his fictitious Latin name "Velocitus Delectiblus". Wile licks his lips, then dashes after his nemesis. The Road Runner taunts Wile E. with a Beep-beep before blasting into Mach 225, disappearing beyond the 10 mile horizon in only 5 frames of film, dusting up all the roads in the distance. Wile stops in mid-stride and points at the bird saying "Did you see that?", then thinks of his new plan. 1. The Coyote attaches a pointed blade to the end of his nose and plunges himself off a bow at the passing Road Runner, but instead spears through the trunk of a saguaro, which breaks out of the ground and falls over a cliff. 2. Wile then loads himself into a slingshot and cuts the string as the Road Runner dashes ahead of him, but nothing happens. He ducks out of the slingshot and puts his head into it to peer at the "faulty" string, but then it activates and pitches the Coyote onto the stone ground 10 feet away. 3. The Coyote lies in wait for the Road Runner to come around a turn and lights a cannon fuse, but instead of firing the cannonball, the entire cannon, with Wile on board, is fired backwards into a mountain wall. When Wile steps out of the cannon, it fires another ball into his face. 4. He then attempts to use a stone "wrecking ball" attached to a tree to hit the Roadrunner, but instead hits the trunk of the tree, which hammers him into the rock he is standing on. 5. Next, Wile simply rolls the ball down a hill out into the road, but it pitches up a stone serac and right back on top of its owner. 6. Wile covers a narrow canyon floor with Acme GREASE, but once again, a truck just happens to be approaching. He tries to run across the grease, but fails and is run over. The Road Runner easily glides over it, so he attempts to follow. However, each attempt moves him forward a negligible amount of distance until he finally collapses in the grease. 7. The Road Runner is then seen zipping to one end of a cliff and beeping at the Coyote on the other end, who attempts to swing over the canyon but only smacks into a plateau just underneath him. 8. Wile leaves out bird seed while he climbs to the top of the cliff and prepares his trap. The Road Runner zips up and munches down, while the Coyote lowers a dynamite stick on the end of a fishing line. Instead of blowing up the Road Runner, the flame travels up the line and back to the TNT box, which explodes on the Coyote. 9. He then creates a tar-and-feather machine based on his readings of How To Tar And Feather A Road Runner: 10th printing, and successfully tests it on a small cactus. Wile hides in a thin crevice with the machine pointed towards the road that the Road Runner traverses. Unfortunately, the emitters spin around and attack their owner, and the Roadrunner, as if it were the simplest thing in the world , holds up a sign saying: ROAD-RUNNERS ALREADY HAVE FEATHERS! 10. Wile prepares one final trap: a dynamite pit in the road. Just after he lights the fuse, the Road Runner stops short of him and beeps in his face, provoking a short chase that ends when he runs directly over his own exploding pit. Dejected, the charred Coyote walks off-camera and returns with a stand-up sign that says: Wanted: One gullible Coyote. Apply to manager of this theater. Then he goes back and returns with the Looney Tunes "That\'s all folks!" end-title card. The End. The title is a pun on "Guided Missile". That was one of the few Road Runner Cartoons that does not make use of the declining slide whistle used for the Coyote, when he falls down a cliff, or when he leaps up into the air and comes down, due to the scariness of the surprising beeping Road Runner, or when a boulder, or a bomb falls on the Coyote.'] ['Because Bezhin Meadow was repeatedly edited, re-shot, and changed to satisfy the Soviet government authorities, several versions of the film were created. The most sourced and best-known version focuses on Stepok, a young boy in a collective farming village, who is a member of the local Young Pioneers Communist organization, as are other local children. His father Samokhin, a farmer, plans to sabotage the village harvest for political reasons by burning down the titular meadow, but Stepok organizes the other Young Pioneer children to guard the crops.<ref nameSlavoj | lastA Plea for Leninist Intolerance | dateThe European Graduate School | url  2010-05-05}}{{cite news}} A later re-editing of the film opens with images of orchards and blue sky, showing a stone obelisk with Turgenev\'s name on it. It is next revealed that Stepok\'s mother has been beaten to death by his father. In a dark hut, Samokhin complains that his son has a greater loyalty to the Soviet than his own family, as Stepok enters from the bright day outside. His father quotes from the Bible: "If the son betrays his father, kill him like a dog!" Samokhin is arrested for arson, and Stepok leaves with a Communist functionary. The other arsonists take refuge in the local church, and are soon arrested. The arsonists are nearly lynched, but are saved from the villagers\' wrath by Stepok. The villagers transform the church into a clubhouse, symbolically ridiculing religion or the clergy. The film, as mentioned by Shumyatsky and Eisenstein, is rich in religious iconography and the symbolic struggle between good and evil. Additionally, Birgit Beumers writes, "The peasants here are grey-bearded prophets; the young men are broad-shouldered Renaissance apostles; the fleshy girls are earthly Madonnas; the peasant wrecking the iconostasis is a biblical Samson; the chubby young boy in the shirt, raised high under the cupola towards the slanting sun-ray which turns his locks golden, is the young Jesus Christ ascending to the Heavenly Throne." .'] ['In the film, two boys, Xiao Dabao and Wang Xiaoshuai, were good friends in their childhood because they were crazy about Michael Jackson and they were refused by the most beautiful girl of their school. When they grew up, they had the life which was not very rich and comfortable and they decided to be take part in a singing competition after they knew the death of Michael Jackson. The song named Old Boys which contained their old memories was performed by them. Unfortunately, they failed the competition when they became the top 50. However, their performance touched the judges and a lot of audience .They also had new experience of their life.'] ['Introduction: The Road Runner is in the middle of the road, and after surveying his surroundings, dashes at hyperspeed onto a low plateau , then continues to mountain roads and leaves dust clouds everywhere. Meanwhile, Wile E. Coyote  emerges from his hibernation and is soon fully awoken by a Beep-beep. He peeks over the plateau to see the Road Runner at the bottom and strides down the vertical edge with eating utensils, in pursuit of breakfast. The Road Runner taunts his nemesis by dodging at the last possible moment, allowing the coyote to slam into the rock floor. The chase moves to the real roads, and the Road Runner taunts him with a Beep-beep before blasting into Mach 187, disappearing beyond the 10 mile horizon in only 6 frames of film, causing Wile E.\'s entire jaw to hang open and then drop out as he enters a cloud. The coyote trails dust as he reclines on a low rock to dream his next plan. 1. Wile E. covers an entire section of a canyon with glue, making sure to leave space for himself to stand. However, the approaching Beep-beep belongs to a truck and not the Road Runner, and thus the coyote lacks sufficient time to escape the glue; he tries anyway and cannot leap far enough before he gets stuck, and can only watch as he is flattened. Wile E. thus tries another method: covering a low rockface with glue and preparing, from a distance, to throw dynamite at the Road Runner. However, the bird\'s velocity causes the glue to part sideways, drowning Wile E. in his hiding place and preventing him from throwing the dynamite. After failing at this and at blowing out the fuse, he begins walking with his hips  in an effort to allow the wind to snuff or slow the burning fuse, then jumps into a nearby river; however, the explosive detonates about three feet above, and the coyote pauses in midair before he falls into the water. 2. A detour sign points through a hollow log, and the Road Runner "falls" for the trap by dashing in at full speed. The camera zooms out to show that the exit leads only to air, but does not show the Road Runner; it then cuts to him perched on the very edge of the log. Wile E. is puzzled and climbs into the log; the bird beeps and exits out a hole in the top, and the coyote peeks out after him, but his weight causes the log to tip over the cliff. 3. Now, the coyote hopes to flatten the bird with a 10,000-lb weight supported by a pair of pulleys. However, the weight doesn\'t drop when the coyote lets go of the rope, only falling on the coyote when he resumes the chase. Wile E. strolls into view postured like a walking barchair. 4. Seeing the Road Runner approach his cliff lair, Wile E. lights a sequence of fireworks attached to a lasso, but the Road Runner is actually running down a different cliff, and the coyote inertially spins the lasso until the hissing fireworks explode. 5. Next, Wile E. loads himself into a slingshot and retreats for maximum velocity, until he backs into a beeping Road Runner; the slingshot fires before he can grab the bird, and the coyote flies 2 feet above the ground, into a tunnel, and is squashed into a passing truck\'s grille. 6. Wile E. uses an outboard motor, a jim-dandy wagon, a wash tub, water, and roller skates to create a hydropowered wagon that will hopefully lead him on his quest. He soon passes a DANGER BRIDGE OUT sign and cannot stop the wagon from running off the bridge; he unties himself from the wagon as it rolls into thin air, but sees the rope dropping to the river below and, worst of all, the wagon arriving safely at the other end of the bridge! The coyote funereally waves at the camera before he plummets into the river. 7. Wile E. observes the Road Runner\'s trajectory across the mountain and ignites a rocket aimed at a particular location. The camera cuts to both the rocket and the Road Runner chicken-style until the rocket hits its target location, but just after his enemy. The rocket continues down through the mountain and out of a mine before giving up the ghost. Wile E. sighs with relief - and then the rocket explodes. 8. The coyote uses a female Road Runner costume to attract his counterpart, but  only attracts a rout of coyotes who chase him down the road like the scenes of Tom and Jerry\'s The Brothers Carry-Mouse-Off as the real Road Runner pulls into view with "THE END" sign. The End.'] ["The Stooges are carpetlayers working at the home of Professor Sneed  and his daughter . Sneed is developing a rocket fuel in secret for the government.

In the first scene, Bugs wakes up in his rabbit hole and remarks that he is late for work. His "work" consists of performing routines with Elmer Fudd, Yosemite Sam, and Daffy Duck. During the routines, there is a strange pile of glowing carrots in the background, but Bugs ignores them. The next day, Bugs wakes up and returns to work, but Elmer, Yosemite Sam, and Daffy Duck appear as poorly-drawn versions of themselves with strangely friendly attitudes which Bugs finds exasperating. In each of Bugs\' routines, they offer him a carrot. After two offers, Bugs accepts the carrot from Daffy but decides to eat it later. Back home, Bugs can\'t sleep, so he tries to figure out why Elmer, Sam, and Daffy appear so different, the carrot produces a poorly drawn version of Bugs. The impostor attempts to kill the real Bugs with an axe and Bugs runs off screaming . The typical "That\'s All Folks!" scene plays, but Bugs interrupts, claiming he must get to the bottom of the mystery. He finds tags on Elmer, Sam, and Daffy indicating that the impostors were made on the planet "Nudnik", and realizes he must get rid of them to get the original characters back. He collects the now malfunctioning "pale stereotypes" into a sack and fires them into space, and they get sucked into a black hole which swallows the impostors. The following morning, Bugs wakes up to find all of his enemies are back to normal. After the credits, an impostor Porky Pig pops out of the Looney Tunes drum. Trying to utter the line "That\'s All, Folks!" Bugs throws out the impostor and drags in the real Porky Pig, placing him inside the drum.

Oblivious to the danger around them, they are soon captured by the Big Bad Wolf, who disguises himself as a voluptuous mermaid to entice the two hapless porkers and then catching them in a net. While the Wolf plans to entrap Practical Pig as well using a fake letter requesting help by his brothers, the Three Little Wolves, who were told by their father that they don\'t eat until he captured Practical, try to eat one of Fifer\'s legs as a sandwich but the Wolf, seeing what his sons are doing, promptly blows the little wolves down.

Gobber is convinced that his old nemesis The Boneknapper Dragon, a giant, yet perfectly silent dragon  that clothes itself in bones for armor, is responsible. However no one else believes that the Boneknapper even exists, much less that it burned his house, especially when the evidence suggests that the fire was started by his underwear drying at his hearth and catching fire. Undeterred, Gobber vows to hunt down the beast once and for all and Hiccup reluctantly decides that he cannot let his mentor go alone, so he convinces his Viking recruit comrades to join him as well. As the gang row to the island where Gobber believes the dragon lives, Gobber tells them of his past encounters with the monster, shown to the viewer in traditional animation. He apparently first met it when he discovered a group of frozen Vikings after he relieved himself on an iceberg during a family outing and he extracted a small treasure chest from the ice. As the frozen Viking he stole it from resisted by punching him in the face a couple of times, the Boneknapper appeared and chased him until he landed back in the family boat. The contents of the chest turn out to be a small bone that Gobber has since used as a belt buckle. The stories continue, becoming increasingly ridiculous as Gobber tells of later encounters with the Boneknapper being interfered with by hammerhead sharks, a whales, a yak jumping out of an active volcano and the Norse thunder god Thor. Unfortunately, the group's attention is so occupied that they allow their boat to run aground and sink. Taking the loss of their only way home in stride, Gobber sets up a trap using Fishlegs as bait. The gang still refused to believe Gobber's claims, but unfortunately, a real Boneknapper silently comes up from behind the group and Fishlegs' attempts to warn them are ignored until it is in position to attack. At the same time, the Boneknapper makes a squeaky sound in its failed attempt to roar. Realizing that Gobber was telling the truth about the Boneknapper all along, the gang have to take shelter inside their own trap. All seems lost, but Hiccup sees an empty spot on the dragon's neck armor that exactly resembles Gobber's belt buckle bone. Hiccup realizes that the Boneknapper may simply be seeking to reclaim it from Gobber to complete his armor and be able to roar. Gobber initially refuses to heed Hiccup's advice to placate the creature. However, he is soon seized by the beast and finally gives in. He throws the bone back at the dragon; the bone lands perfectly in the empty spot and the dragon is finally able to triumphantly roar with his armor completed. As it turns out, the satisfied Boneknapper is a friendly one and Gobber finally develops a newfound love and respect for the creature. The adventurers then ride the Boneknapper, presumably towards Berk. As Fishlegs informs the others that the dragon's roar is a mating call, four other Boneknappers appear from the distance. Gobber notes that he will definitely be believed this time."] ['To the tune "I Would Like to Be a Bird," a young mouse fashions wings from a pair of leaves, to the great amusement of his brothers when his attempts to use them fail, he falls into the tub and shrinks his sisters dress and gets spanked by his mother.

Here, he is seen wearing a shirt for the first time.{{cite web}} Also joining him in his adventure is a brown slender dog, running along. At a site not too faraway, a live girl teddy bear is keeping herself in shape by having her waist shuffled by a moving towel. The towel's ends are attached to the back of a shaky automobile. Meanwhile, her little brother hops on the car's front seat for a moment and jumps off, but accidentally moves a switch. As a result, the automobile was shaken too much for her liking, and she calls for help. Oswald picks up the distress call and comes to her aid. For some reason, Oswald fires his gun at the vehicle, stopping it completely. The teddy bear was relieved of her trouble and was most thankful. Oswald and the teddy bear befriended each other. As the rabbit greets her goodbye to carry on in his journey, the beautiful bruin asks him where he is heading. Oswald then tells he is on a hunting trip. Finding his activity interesting, the teddy bear requests him to get her a fox skin. Oswald agrees to her wish. Oswald and his dog set off in their horse to hunt for a fox. The fox in the area knows of their purpose, and therefore thinks of ways to keep them at bay. Minutes later, they were standing side-by-side, looking for their targeted animal. Without the two knowing, the fox comes up behind them and ties the dog's tail around the Oswald's leg. The fox then kicks Oswald in the rear, prompting the rabbit to send the dog into a chase. In this, Oswald was pulled several yards away. His ride on the dog's tail would end as they ran into a residential gate. Just to toy its pursuers, the fox steps on mud then walks on the ground, leaving a trail of its footprints. Oswald and the dog followed the tracks which lead to a tree, and Oswald goes for a climb. The rabbit reaches the top but finds nothing. It appears that the fox was actually on the ground as it ties the dog's tail around a wooden spike and goes on to shake the tree. Oswald then drops to ground, and the fox flees the scene. Oswald chases the fox into a house. As he enters, the fox leaps out from a window and closes the door. Thinking the rabbit has lost track, the fox stands and laughs just beside the entrance. All of a sudden, however, Oswald comes back out. Thus the fox ends up smashed by the door and pressed against the house's front wall. Just then, the teddy bear came to Oswald, asking him if he got the fox skin she requested. Oswald then peels the flattened fox off the house and puts it on her like a scarf. Oswald and the teddy bear considered going on a date together."] ['The actors from the Benji films are on a promotional tour in Switzerland and are asked to be grand marshalls of a Christmas parade in Zermatt.

A down payment has made, but it is not enough. The Stooges decide to go hunting anyway to help out the colony.

Before the cat goes inside, Oswald asked her if they should be married to each other as well as having a dozen children. The cat considers this a possibility and agrees with Oswald. It then turns out that the cat also has a romantic relationship with a bloodhound who comes out of the condo. The bloodhound angrily kicks Oswald away and takes the cat inside, much to the rabbit's surprise. Still willing to pursue his dreams with the cat, Oswald elevates the carriage of his car above its chassis. He then moves the car to a condo window of a certain floor and attempts to serenade the cat with a trombone. Oswald's musical play prevailed as the cat showed up from the window.

When Bob asks Larry about this, Larry explains that before the show he stopped at a local fast food restaurant for lunch. When he got his meal he sang a prayer over his food, thanking God for his food. Larry is now feeling embarrassed because the kids in the next booth laughed at him for doing this. Bob decides to devote this show to Larry\'s problem. The story opens with a child Minnesota Cuke chasing after the three Scallions who have stolen the Muskie of 47\' Minn manages to retrieve the Muskie, albeit briefly, as the Scallions steal it back. The scene then shifts to show an adult Minnesota who is still trying to retrieve the Muskie but continues to fail before being taunted by citizens. Later, Mister Humphry Muffet sends Minn on a quest around the world in search for Noah’s Ark to keep in his backyard as a tourist attraction despite Minnesota being upset for public humiliation. Minnesota then learns of the mysterious and powerful relic "Noah\'s Umbrella". He then teams up with his girlfriend Julia  who is now an ice cream franchise owner for Malta and Mexico and his former arch-enemy, Professor Rattan originally sent on the quest by Muffet, to find the ark before Rattan\'s twin brother, Wicker, uses Noah\'s umbrella for his own schemes. Wicker wants Noah\'s Umbrella to have to control weather and force people to pay him for heat, rain and cold weather and eventually rule the world believing falsely that the rain came from the umbrella than God; and is close to finding the ark with an army of potatoes. The problem is, Minnesota is afraid that people will still laugh at him, and he fails to carry out some of the steps. Thankfully, Minn has the help of a few very good friends, but he will need to overcome his fear of what others think if he is going to unlock the mystery of the umbrella and save the day. Minnesota when being mocked all this time by citizens for doing the right thing, rescues Rattan when he is revealed to have been kidnapped by Wicker and they escape Wicker and his men to a tavern on a large snowy mountain and perform a song "Arise and Shine" for a clue. After deciphering several clues to the ark they are once again captured by Wicker who locks them up in a cage set by time to be thrown off a steep mountain peak; they escape when Minnesota learns that God\'s love is like a shield when he does the right thing. They catch up with Wicker and his men in a tunnel from the tavern but are again caught when they reach a dead end inside the mountain. Wicker ties up Rattan and Julia to force Minnesota to choose between helping him get the umbrella or a deadly avalanche over Julia and Rattan. Minnesota reluctantly agrees to help Wicker for his friends\' lives and passes 3 tests about doing the right thing as Wicker and his men follow but laugh at him for the methods only to have calamity come upon them; Minnesota\'s love for God helps him not hear them mock and soon he comes close to the umbrella. Eventually after passing the tests Minnesota finds a series of umbrellas on a shelf inside the mountain. Minnesota recognizes upon a glance that a checkered colored umbrella is the artifact and Wicker tries to use it to control the weather but is furious and dismayed when he learns that the umbrella does not have the power but that God does to give rain; he got his false theory on the umbrella\'s power from a children\'s cartoon shown earlier about Noah; causing his own army to mock him for making an evil scheme off of the cartoon. Wicker\'s whining about not getting his way causes an avalanche forcing them to retreat with the umbrella, as Julia and Rattan barely escape being squashed by the falling ice and snow before the entire group flees back to the tavern where Mr. Muffet and 2 Mountie agents arrest Wicker and his army for their crimes. The umbrella then is made a protected artifact and when Muffet wonders where the ark is after further unseen studying they conclude that the ark has rotted away after thousands of years under cold weather and snow.

It gets caught on some electrical telephone wires on the way down, where a nearby woman is busy gossiping on the phone, and then falls into the sewers where the strange combination of electricity and gossip brings the plant to life... The next morning, Alfred is speaking at Veggie Valley Elementary. As his story comes to a close, he tells the teacher that he needs to go home and "recharge his batteries." Not quite understanding the figure of speech, students Junior Asparagus and Laura Carrot come to the false conclusion that Alfred is a robot. As they are walking home, they run into a small talking weed who overhears the two children and talks them into sharing the secret with her. Similar weeds then begin to appear throughout Bumblyburg, spreading the rumor and twisting the faulty assumptions of the citizens into fear. At Larry Manor, Larry and Alfred are tending to the garden when Alfred heads inside to answer the phone. Another Rumor Weed appears and tries to spread the word about Alfred, but Larry doesn\'t let it get a word in edgewise. Alfred then calls Larry in to answer the phone: Mayor Blueberry informs him that strange weeds are growing all over the city and saying strange things about Alfred. Suiting up as Larry-Boy, the hero drives into action. Larry-Boy manages to find a Rumor Weed and attempts to prune it, but weed-whackers and shears have no effect. Alfred then tells him to scan the weed by putting his plunger-ear by it, which only serves to get Larry-Boy thrown away by the seemingly-tiny weed\'s strength. Back at the Larry-Cave, Alfred reports his findings and reveals that all the weeds are connected through a vast root system leading to a giant Mother Weed deep underground. Realizing that these Weeds are strong enough to knock down abandoned buildings and tear down old houses, Larry-Boy and Alfred decide that they need to attack it at the root. Fortunately, Alfred has modified the Larry-Mobile with a new boring machine feature, allowing Larry-Boy to drill through the ground into the sewers. Upon arriving in the sewer, however, Larry-Boy and Alfred lose radio contact, and the faithful butler is forced to run for help himself. Meanwhile, Larry-Boy meets the Mother Weed and is quickly overpowered by its strength. As Alfred arrives at City Hall, he is astonished to find that the usually-kind citizens are afraid of him, saying strange and scary things about him being a killer robot with laser eyes. Though the butler tries to convince them that he\'s not a robot, he is unable to stop the rumor. Suddenly, the Mother Weed rises out from underground and grabs Alfred, but the citizens think the "killer robot" is going to be destroyed and they thus refuse to help. Dad Asparagus arrives on the scene and asks what is going on. While the citizens explain that the weeds told them about Alfred, the Mother Weed admits that she didn\'t make up the story and that she credits two "very reliable sources". Faced with the truth that they started the rumor, Junior and Laura confess, and Dad explains to them that "even if it\'s true, God doesn\'t want us to tell stories that can hurt. He want us to spread nice words". When Dad\'s positive words about Alfred cause flowers to grow on the Mother Weed, Junior and Laura decide that the best way to save Alfred is to spread good words about him. They are able to convince the citizens of Bumblyburg that Alfred is not a robot at all, but a very nice man. As the word spreads, the Mother Weed grows flowers on its vines until she transforms into a giant flower, thus saving Alfred. As everybody celebrates, a beat-up Larry-Boy comes crawling out of the sewers and asks Alfred if he\'s a robot, which everybody promptly shushes him on. The episode is wrapped up in the Larry-Cave.

He spots the mouse and slides Jerry off the hammock and into the water; Jerry shortly wakes up after realising he cannot breathe. In retaliation the mouse flips the hammock over, so Tom falls to the ground and swallows his drink glass. After Jerry sits down to sleep, Tom shakes out the hammock such that Jerry is thrown into the air, but by pure fortune the mouse falls into a bird\'s nest. It stretches along with his weight and then throws the mouse onto the tree branches, through the truck and right back onto the hammock before Tom can lay down. When he hears Jerry snoring again, Tom spots him and is dumbfounded. In response, he scoops up the mouse and drops him on top of a marching ant army. Jerry wakes up at this jostling, but before he can understand what has happened, he bumps his head on a steel sprinkler. Knowing who is responsible for this, Jerry redirects the ants such that they march onto the hammock, causing the strings to snap and roll the hammock up with the cat inside. In the next scene, the broken strings are tied back together, and Tom keeps a lookout for Jerry while taking a refreshing drink. Meanwhile, Jerry walks onto a lily pad behind a bullfrog and kicks it into Tom\'s drink. Despite the splashing noise, Tom sees nothing extraordinary and drinks the drink - and the frog.

Sopping wet, the feline recovers and sees Jerry, who is stealing his drink to boot. Tom bolts after the mouse, who flees in fright but soon sets a lawn mower after his opponent.

A man in a strange hat greets a man sitting in a chair and addresses him as "Bingo". When the man in the chair denies being named Bingo, the man in the hat insists that he is, in fact, "Bingo the Clown-o". As the man in the chair tries to correct him, the man in the hat continues to address him as Bingo at greater and greater volume, ending with a loud shout and cutting off the protests. After a fade to black, the same basic scene begins to play out again, this time with computer-animated characters. A man, "Dave," is sitting in a chair under a spotlight and surrounded by darkness. A clown enters, smoking a cigarette, and addresses Dave as "Bingo." Dave starts to protest that he\'s not "Bingo the Clown," but the clown ignores him and repeats the phrases "Hi, Bingo!" and "Bingo the Clown!" With each repetition, the clown\'s voice gets louder and he grows physically larger until he is screaming at Dave with a head larger than Dave\'s entire body. A female harlequin enters, calling for "Music, please!" As she exits, the stage is illuminated and an instrumental version of the song "Daisy Bell"  begins to play. Strange screens rise up from under the floor and begin displaying a series of seemingly random images interspersed with pictures of clowns and the words "Hi Bingo!" At the same time, the clown begins riding a bicycle in circles around Dave while balancing a piano on one hand, and Dave is bombarded with peanuts. The harlequin descends from the ceiling and orders the music to stop. As she exits, the music stops and the lights dim, leaving Dave alone in a spotlight once again. A little girl clown enters, holding a balloon that keeps bursting and re-inflating in new colors. She addresses Dave as "Bingo" and warns him that "he" is coming to "check on your progress." When Dave asks if Bingo is the one who is coming, the balloon girl\'s face transforms into a gigantic, snake-like monster and she shouts that Dave is Bingo. She then turns immediately back into a little girl to inform Dave that "he" is coming. The first clown walks through the spotlight, still carrying the piano in one hand, and drops his bicycle beside Dave\'s chair before leaving. The balloon girl calls Dave "Bingo" again, and when he tries to protest, he is interrupted by the harlequin shouting "Music, please!" again. The music begins playing again, and the screens also reappear, but are soon replaced by enormous, robotic faces. The balloon girl drifts away on a giant balloon, and a human-sized flea walks past with a sign announcing "The Money Guy." The harlequin returns briefly and orders the music to stop before disappearing. When the music stops, there is a strange creature with no legs, many arms, a man\'s head, and dollar bills sprouting from its neck and arms. It yells at Dave for "looking at my money," but then offers to let Dave look at his money. Confused and frightened, Dave declares that yes, he would like to look at the creature\'s money. The creature congratulates him for being a "good, little Bingo." Dave says that he doesn\'t think that he\'s Bingo, asking "who am I?" The harlequin once again calls for music. This time, the lighting does not change, but the money creature is wheeled away as music plays and then fades out. Left alone, Dave says that maybe his is "Bingo" after all. The clown reappears, sitting in an easy chair, wearing glasses, with an axe embedded in his head. The clown asks Dave to confirm that he is "Bingo the Clown." Dave agrees, stating enthusiastically that he is "Bingo, Bingo the Clown-o!" He stands up and starts dancing around while shaking a baby\'s rattle. The lights come on, fully illuminating the room, and a voice on a loudspeaker says "Thank you. Next." The screen cuts to black, and the credits begin.'] ["In a run down apartment complex, Bunny is looking through a photo album of memories. The pictures start to come to life as she daydreams.

Stupendous is interrupted in his office by Daffy asking for an acting position, and quickly responds "No!" and states, "Y\'know, that duck\'s screwy!" The phone rings and Daffy pops out of it saying "You\'re correct, absolutely correct!", pinching Stupendous\'s nose. Stupendous then phones Director von Hamburger  and orders him to finish the picture he\'s working on that day. On the set, all the crew rushes to follow Hamburger\'s order for a close-up, who starts smoking a cigarette. Daffy then swipes and starts smoking the cigarette, spelling out Warner Bros with the smoke. Hamburger asks how the sound is, and Daffy whistles into the microphone. He orders the lights turned, which Daffy has connected the emergency fire hose to, causing water to gush out of the lights and down on the set. When the camera rolls, it starts shooting bullets Daffy planted. Hamburger begins crying. Daffy sympathetically gives him a gift, promising to stop being screwy, and walks away. However, Daffy then pops up out of the gift box, bites Hamburger\'s nose and starts jumping around. As filming begins, a typical romantic scene between a rooster and hen plays out. When the inevitable kiss comes up, Daffy jumps in and kisses the hen; he is so excited that he does it again. Hamburger declares the scene ruined and gives orders to cut the scene. The time being noon, Hamburger asks for lunch: turkey with all the trimmings. However, Daffy is under the platter and bites Hamburger\'s nose beak again, then jumps away. Then, in the film room, Daffy begins clipping and pasting together random film clips, which he switches out with Hamburger\'s film when Hamburger tells Stupendous that his film is finished. Hamburger shows the "film", which contains humorous live action clips of random scenes, such as gold mining, square dancing, the World Championship Fight in Madison Round Garden, etc. Despite Hamburger\'s obvious  fear, Stupendous approves highly of the film. As a result, Daffy is now the director, uttering the same line asking for turkey at lunchtime as Hamburger, complete with Hamburger\'s accent and clothing. Hamburger is now the screwball, hiding under the platter, biting Daffy\'s nose, then jumping away, as Daffy did earlier.'] ['The film begins with shots of American bombers flying in formation and the narrator giving the audience a dictionary definition of a "special delivery" and the vital role that air power played in winning the late conflict. He goes on to say that the Air Force can have constructive, as well as destructive uses—several examples are shown of this, including the dropping of food and supplies to remote areas, using B-17s to get serum to Alaska and B-25s to deploy DDT, and using helicopters to rescue the wounded. These are all examples of the peaceful uses of the air power that had been created for war. Various new aircraft are also shown, such as an early jet, and a "flying wing". Finally, with much fanfare, the bomb is loaded onto a plane called Dave\'s Dream and dropped on the test armada. All the personnel whose duties require them to watch the proceedings are given protective goggles to watch "man\'s most terrible weapon". Following the detonation, firefighting and scientific research efforts are shown, culminating in a summary of the bomb\'s effects: "x-ray and high speed atomic particles, both deadly types of radioactivity" are discovered and heavy damage is sustained to the target ships. The film concludes with the message that the air forces responsible for helping to win World War II are now leading the world in peaceful enterprise: in short, that "air power is peace power".'] ['The Stooges are inventors desperately trying to obtain a patent for their fly catching invention.

Meanwhile, Popeye the Sailor is heading for Britain with a shipment of spinach to donate as a war ration; his ship is attacked and sunk by the Nazi patrol before he can reach Britain. Popeye manages to escape with his spinach in a rowboat but is pursued by the Nazis. Popeye flips the U-boat upside-down and quickly withdraws. But Popeye rows into a minefield and his boat is destroyed before he can escape. Popeye quickly collects all his spinach before the U-boat catches up with him. The Nazis ready their U-boat\'s turret but smoke from Popeye\'s tobacco pipe causes it to sneeze and fire uncontrollably, knocking Popeye out cold and sending his spinach flying into the air.

The cartoon begins as a parody of the opening to The Adventures of Superman, which shows Stupor Duck being: *"Faster than a bullet"  *"More powerful than a speeding locomotive"  *"Able to leap the tallest building"  After the parodied introduction, the film proceeds to the story: Mild-mannered newspaper reporter Cluck Trent, taking a break from writing, overhears a conversation coming from his editor\'s office. The one-sided conversation is from a villain on a "corny soap opera" the editor is watching on TV. The unseen soap\'s villain calls himself "Aardvark Ratnik," a Russian-accented terrorist hell-bent on world domination. Ratnik supposedly threatens widespread destruction ; his first line, after a maniacal laugh, is "You cannot stop me, Mr. Newspaper Editor!", which leads Cluck to the erroneous conclusion that Ratnik actually exists, his threats are serious, and that stopping him is a job for Stupor Duck. Cluck runs to the broom closet to change into his alter-ego  and begins his search for the non-existent antagonist. One by one, Stupor Duck spots "examples" of "Aardvark\'s" supposed work, screaming out before tackling each one "THIS is a job for STU-U-U-POR Duck!". His search includes: *A building being destroyed. Stupor Duck pushes the building back upright, only to be punched out by the site foreman; the building was to be demolished and replaced with a new City Hall. *A sinking ship, which was actually a submarine conducting war games. Stupor Duck pulls the sub back to the surface and is promptly blown up by one of its torpedoes. *A dynamite charge at the base of a railroad trestle as a train runs over it. It turned out to be a Warner Brothers location shoot. Stupor Duck grabs the dynamite and heads skyward, blown up by the unknowing explosives expert, who is abruptly showered with black feathers and the "S" shield from Stupor Duck\'s costume. *Lastly, as Stupor Duck hears a siren while unknowingly flying over government testing grounds, he spots what he thinks is an armed warhead, but is actually a government moon rocket. Right after Stupor Duck lands on the nose cone to try to stop it, the rocket launches into space, leaving behind Stupor Duck\'s costume in its wake. As the rocket hurtles skyward, two rock climbers see it and shout "Up there in the sky! It\'s a bird! It\'s a plane! It\'s STU-U-UPOR Duck!" The final shot is of Daffy screaming, still clinging to the rocket for dear life at it streaks toward the moon.'] [' The film uses animated diagrams to detail the menstrual cycle.Film Threat review The Story of Menstruation is believed to be the first film to use the word vagina in its screenplay.<ref nameFebruary 2009}} The menstrual flow was depicted as snow white instead of blood red.

On this planet, there is a race of Martians who are advanced and have happiness all throughout their lives, except for one Martian whose fed up with his homeworld\'s perfect society. Levitating in the air, passing through solid objects, and projecting images from his blue antenna do nothing but bore him. When an attractive female Martian offers to pitch some love to the Martian, he just turns her away, causing her to melt. The Martian then goes to see a psychiatrist, who recommends that he travel to another world to cure his boredom. The Martian then leaves in a flying saucer that is launched by slingshot and sent deep into space. After some time , he enters the Earth\'s solar system and stops at Earth. While observing the typical Earth activities , the Martian discovers he likes this planet and decides to land there. As the flying saucer lands in Atlanta, Georgia , a crowd of people gather round the Martian and run away screaming "Monster!" The Martian is confused about the monster everybody\'s talking about and gets arrested by the police for landing in a "no parking" zone. After he gets questioned by the authorities and put in a jail cell, the Martian leaves by passing through the walls, causing the prison guard to cry out for his mother while he sounds the escape whistle. The next morning, a tall man and a short man are reading the newspapers about the Martian\'s escape. The tall man makes a comment about the Martian based on the newspaper\'s description  to which the short man scolds "If you can\'t say anything nice about someone, you shouldn\'t say anything at all." As the tall man walks away, the Martian hugs the short man, causing the short man to turn white with fright and call the Martian exactly the same description the tall man gave before fleeing in terror. Still confused about the "monster," the Martian vows to seek out and destroy him. As the Martian passes a construction site, he spots a steam shovel at work. Assuming this is the monster everybody\'s talking about, he whips out an ACME Atom Rearranger and shoots the steam shovel, turning it into a dragon that licks the construction worker and waddles off. Satisfied that the "monster" has been destroyed, the Martian walks off confidently, eager to do more good deeds for Earth. As the Martian passes a red haired boy reading a comic book, the boy says "Hello, Monster" directly at the Martian. Confused as to what the boy said, the Martian asks the boy why he called him "monster," to which the boy points out something he\'d found in his comic book: a page that informs the reader that a space monster has no nose, which the Martian doesn\'t have. The Martian gets the idea to remove his antenna and put it on his face to pass it off as a nose, but the boy just says "Goodbye, Monster." Now realizing that he is the monster, the Martian runs through a nightmarish landscape as voices all around him call him monster and berate him to go home. Just as the Martian ducks into an alley, the narrator recommends that the Martian could just commit suicide since nobody loves him. The Martian takes out his ray gun and is about to blow his brains out when the narrator reminds him that somebody does love him. Taking this advice to heart, the Martian puts his antenna back in place on his head and remembers the single sexy female Martians . Now wanting to seek happiness back on his homeplanet, the Martian blasts off back home, which is seen as a star in a constellation of stars that picture a heart.'] [" A shipowner intends to scuttle his ship on its last voyage to get the insurance money.

While singing, the voice boasts of his previous experience in other venues. The voice turns out to belong to a tiny grasshopper, who ends his performance with Blanc\'s trademark pronunciation of "Cuc-amonga". Porky, who is the agency\'s producer and listening to the auditions, tells the grasshopper he might have a spot for him. The rest of the short consists of a series of acts by various performers, most of whom Porky rejects. * A hen  clucks Blue Danube. Porky seems to like this act, but the hen literally "lays an egg" and takes this event in its figurative sense in that her act flopped. Porky pulls a lever next to his desk that sends the hen and the egg with a sad looking chick  in it through a trap door in the floor. * A fox, voiced by Stan Freberg, bursts in telling Porky that his act is the best ever, but Porky tells him that it\'s not his turn yet. * A turtle resembling Cecil Turtle but with Blanc\'s voice says he is the "man of a 1000 voices." He goes through a rapid fire montage of voice impressions . Porky says that he counted only nine hundred ninety nine voices. The turtle is stumped as to what his 1000th voice is and exits the office hoping that he\'ll remember it later . * Bingo the Parrot, Frankie the Rooster, and Al the Duck  sing the popular hit song April Showers, each in the distinctive manner of their namesakes. Porky tells them that he\'ll consider their act but says after they leave that it was a low class act that only bobbysoxers would like . * A two-headed man enters the office. Porky quotes "Oh boy two-headed! This ought to be a sensational act!" The two-headed man quotes "Act, Shmact! I\'m the janitor" as he empties Porky\'s pail into another pail and leaves. * The fox barges into the office again, telling Porky to watch his act. Porky tells him to go back out and wait his turn. * A dog in a bathing suit named J. Fenton Hadding places his briefcase on the floor. It turns out to be a elevated platform that the dog rides through the office skylight 500 feet into the air. The dog then dives into a glass of water that he is holding in his hand . Porky sends the dog stuck in his water glass down the trap door. * Crawford Coo  has a trained pigeon act. He sets up various pigeon-sized acrobatic equipment and releases the pigeons from a box, but the pigeons fly out the window. Crawford tries tap dancing instead, but Porky sends him down the trap door . * The fox bursts in again. Porky sends him down the trap door. * A shaggy dog enters. Porky thinks it\'s a dog act, but the dog hands him a business card, announcing that he is the Itch and Scratch Flea Circus. The dog blows a whistle and fleas hop from his back to build a tiny circus tent and carnival midway, then dismantle it when the dog blows the whistle again. The music played here is the Wackyland Rubber Band music featured in the shorts Tin Pan Alley Cats and Dough for the Do-do. Finally, it is the fox\'s turn to do his act. He dons a devil\'s costume and swallows atomic powder, TNT, gasoline, and finally, a lit match. BOOM! Porky thinks the act is terrific, but the fox  comes through the office door and says that there is only one tiny problem with the act: he can only do it once!'] ['Ibrahim is 13 and they have just expelled him from school, but he fools his father into believing he’s received a diploma…'] ['Introduction: Wile E. Coyote sneaks up on a firework and lights it, hoping for it to explode when the Road Runner passes over it, but it explodes instantly. The credits are shown within the dust, and the coyote\'s Latin name  is visible after they disappear. The Road Runner, significantly late to the party, zooms into view with the name Velocitus incalcublii. The action resumes and both characters begin the chase. Wile catches up to the Road Runner and passes him, but on his side. Wile continues to move further from the Road Runner until signaled. Then, as he is looking backwards, he fails to spot the end of the cliff and suffers gravity. Determined, the coyote shakes it all off and climbs the cliff in sections, visibly straining himself. Finally, he hangs on to the very edge and pulls himself barely up onto the end of the cliff. The Road Runner, out of pure sadism, has waited until now to beep Wile off the cliff and sideways into thin air. Wile E. looks backwards and soon deduces the situation, thus causing gravity to activate a second time. 1. Wile has a simple new plan: Drop a bomb on the Road Runner from a hot air balloon. However, when the coyote inflates the balloon with his mouth, the balloon inflates the coyote instead and Wile floats through the air, just grabbing the bomb before he deflates and flies randomly through the sky. When all the air leaves him, Wile sighs with relief until he sees he is holding the bomb. He lets go of it, only to realize he is also falling! This he attempts to alleviate by increasing his drag, but slows himself enough that the bomb catches up to him. Now, Wile has to speed back up, all the way back down to the ground, and then strategically hide to avoid the bomb; however, underneath a low arch is exactly where the bomb lands. Thinking fast, the coyote spots the bomb\'s end poking through the rock and hears it "ticking", and thus unscrews the head and takes out the explosive. The bomb\'s clock stops ticking, but a relieved Wile is blown up when it abruptly starts ticking again. 2. This time, Wile uses trickery to stop the Road Runner. He posts several white signs along the Road Runner\'s path: "ANXIETIES AND ULCERS" "COME FROM EXCESSIVE SPEED" "SLOW DOWN!" "LIVE LONGER" "USE TRANQUILIZED BIRD SEED!" in an effort to get the Road Runner to stop. The Road Runner obligingly munches while the coyote prepares to lower a bucket to trap the Road Runner. However, he steps on the bucket and cannot keep his foot out of it. Finally, he falls down and has to hold onto the string to stay up, then ends up twisted inside the bucket. The coyote unties the rope, but then sees that was the very rope holding himself up. He hides in the bucket prepared for impact, when by fortune it hangs itself up on a tree branch. Wile relaxes hunched in the bucket until the excessive weight on one side causes the coyote to fall out again and down to the ground. The Road Runner provides a convenient spring, and Wile thanks his rival with a small "THANKS" card as he is bounced directly up into the first branch and is hung up by the wire. 3. Wile hammers a Detour sign into the road, directing the Road Runner to go down a very dangerous outcropping. The Road Runner stops at the very edge, and the coyote follows, trapping the bird. Wile licks his lips, prepares his utensils and walks toward the Road Runner to eat him. The bird stands still, showing no sign of concern or nervousness. Then the thin outcropping breaks and sends Wile to the ground, dejected, and leaving the Road Runner standing on a floating piece of rock. As if that wasn\'t enough, his own utensils follow him down, scrape the skin off his back, and spear his tail, despite his efforts to avoid them. The coyote leaps all the way into the air and rejoins his napkin, and both are hung up on another branch. The entire tree then falls down, pounding the coyote through the ground and into a waterfall. Wile cannot fight the flow, and is swept downstream, under a bridge, and through an entire network of progressively thinner pipes before his arm protrudes out of a spigot. He twists the spigot and the rest of himself comes out, leaving Wile staring at the Road Runner, still standing on the floating piece of rock. Wile, depressed and embarrassed, holds up a sign to the Road Runner and the audience: "I wouldn\'t mind - except that he defies the law of gravity!" The camera cuts to the Road Runner\'s response on a second sign: "Sure - but I never studied law!" The Road Runner leaps off the floating rock with a mighty burst of speed onto a safe haven far to the right  as the cartoon fades.{{Or}} The title is a reference to the epigram "Git thar fustest with the mostest", often erroneously contributed to Nathan Bedford Forrest.Catton.

Bob insists that a Bible story would be best while Larry stands by a promise that the Veggies do a Western. A compromise is reached: the resulting story, "The Ballad of Little Joe", is a Western-style Bible story. The story follows the Biblical account of Joseph and his multi-colored coat from the Book of Genesis. As the story begins we are introduced to the brothers  and then to Little Joe   who all live at the "Okie-Dokie Corral" . Among Larry\'s unique skills are the abilities to solve problems, organize resources, and interpret dreams. We soon learn that it is Little Joe\'s birthday, and the brothers\' father  lavishes attention and gifts upon him. When Joe foretells a time when his brothers will bow down before him, their jealousy turns to spite, and they decide to sell him into slavery. He ends up working at a saloon for Mr. McPotipher , and his unique skills quickly make him an invaluable employee. Also working at the saloon is Miss Kitty  who entertains the patrons from the stage. She also becomes jealous of Joe when he is named Employee of the Month in her place. She frames him and he is imprisoned for the theft of gold, a crime he did not commit. Joe keeps a positive attitude in jail and is able to help two inmates who have been haunted by dreams. His predictions come true: one is released, and the other, presumably, is executed. When his reputation comes to the attention of the Mayor , Joe is summoned to interpret a particularly disturbing dream of the latter, in which seven fat cows are devoured by seven scrawny cows. Joe understands immediately and warns the Mayor: there will be seven years of plenty followed by seven years of famine; fill the storehouses now so you will be prepared. Joe is put in charge of distributing the grain during the years of famine. When he recognizes his own family has come to procure food, he is overcome with emotion. He wants to reveal himself to them, but first needs to know if they have changed. He devises a plan where he frames the youngest brother, Benjamin, for theft to see how they respond. When all the brothers insist on taking the fall in his place and rue the previous loss of another brother, Joe reveals his identity. Jude apologizes to Joe for what he has done to him, who explains that what God used from what wrong he did into good and forgives him. The story concludes with the happy reunion. The Veggie Tales video Moe and the Big Exit is a sequel to this episode.'] ['Cool Cat is driving to the town of Hotfoot one day, when his route happens to take him through a Indian reservation. Two scouts spot him and one of them gives chase, only to fall into a chasm when the weight of him and his horse causes the makeshift bridge to collapse . Cool Cat rescues them and continues his journey. Along the way, he encounters a man who tries to give his heavily obese daughter away, a more attractive woman that invites him for an "Indian Wrestle" , a literal bareback rider and a Native American who uses a stenograph-like device to create smoke signals which read "COOL CAT GO HOME!" Finally arriving in Hotfoot, Cool Cat spots two horses playing human shoes. After that, Cool Cat spots a "Topless Saloon" and heads in, but finds out that the only topless person in there is the bartender, a rather burly man. An outlaw named Gower Gulch then arrives and seemingly challenges Cool Cat to a duel, but then settles for a game of poker. Cool Cat gets a good hand with four Aces, only for Gulch to get a Royal Flush.

After fighting over a stale bean and losing it to a hungry mouse, they happen to read about Mrs. Gloria Van Glutton's musicale and dinner. Eluding butler Wally Walrus, they slip unobserved into the orchestra, where the aroma of a roast pig is too much for Woody. While the hungry mouse swallows a piece of cheese whole, Andy snags a roast turkey with a rod and reel fastened to his violin bow. Wally watches Woody make a sandwich, gets too close, and becomes part of it. Fortunately, a sneeze starts a free-for-all, with Mrs. Van Glutton a leading contender. The guests throw food at each other while Andy, Woody and the mouse stuff themselves—that is, until Wally starts using a shotgun. This breaks up the party and is a great help in sending Woody hopping madly over the hill."] ['{{Plot}}  The film starts with a canary, in its cage, watching the chase. Sounds of breaking glass and other fighting are heard throughout. Tom can now be seen, attempting to smash Jerry with a broom, but instead repeatedly breaking lamps and glasses. Jerry hides in the one unbroken glass and runs away, but Tom picks up the glass and waits for Jerry to realize he is captured. When he does, his heart starts beating and extending out of his chest. Before Tom can club the mouse over the head with the broken end of the broom handle, the canary escapes from his cage by unlatching the base of the cage, which falls onto Tom, flattening his head with a cymbal noise. Tom pursues Jerry, chasing him into his mousehole, into which Tom\'s face gets caught, elongating his nose. Tom then spots the canary, beating his wings into the air within his cage. The cat leaps for him, but instead gets himself caught inside his cage, which he then seals with the base. He flies onto a table and then runs away as Tom pursues him, but instead Tom pokes himself through the center of the table and swallows the canary. Fortunately for him, the everpresent "cuckoo...cuckoo...cuckoo" gag allows the bird to escape. Tom runs after the bird, and then rises into the air, beating his deltoids in order to stay afloat in the same matter as the canary. Tom grins at the camera until he runs into the wall and three potted plants hit him on the head. The cat recovers and sees the canary pacing away under a fourth pot. He covers the pot and pokes his eye through the hole. As Tom reaches under the pot to grab the bird, Jerry inserts Tom\'s tail into the windowsill and snaps the cord. Tom untangles himself and storms after the mouse, and the canary dives down and gives him a lift. They enter the hole, and Tom\'s nose is once again elongated, but this time, he has swallowed the duo. The mouse and canary squeeze out and take sanctuary in the mousehole. After some time, Jerry allows the canary to fly back to his birdcage, but Tom suddenly appears from behind a sofa, mouth wide open, and the bird flies into Tom\'s mouth. Jerry retrieves the bird by using a hammer to break Tom\'s teeth, freeing the bird from his prison. The canary kicks out Tom\'s last tooth and flies off. As Tom snatches Jerry in his hand, the canary pulls up a floorboard and traps Tom\'s tail under it. In pain, Tom leaps up, and smacks his head on the cage, causing it to fall down on his head and onto the floor. As Tom chases Jerry around the corner, the canary pulls him behind a curtain. Jerry and the bird trick Tom by dressing as two Indians and setting out from the curtain. Jerry waves and mutters "Hau." as the canary innocently smiles and waves. Tom doesn\'t catch it for a while, but soon sees the trick and chases after the two. The canary flies back into the small white enclosure strapped to Jerry\'s back. The mouse turns around slowly in dread, and they run off. The canary sticks his tongue out at Tom, only to bump his head on a chair. Tom chases the canary, and soon changes direction and goes after the mouse. Jerry and then Tom dive under a polar-bear skin complete with head, and when Tom pops out of the mouth, the canary  stomps on the head. Tom shrieks in pain and rolls his tongue out. Tom dives for the canary, but stops short in midair when the canary picks up a gun. Tom backs up in dread  until he is cornered next to the fireplace. Seeing a perfect opportunity, Jerry drops a lightbulb, making a noise similar to a shot. Tom, oblivious, believes he was actually shot, utters a dramatic grunt of pain, and sees from the mirror his "grave." Tom flips a coin as he "dies" on the floor. The mouse and the canary celebrate, shaking hands with each other, plus a revived Tom. Noticing the cat, they decide to distract him by repeatedly shaking each other\'s hands and both of Tom\'s hands. Tom gets swept up in the moment of goodwill, and Jerry and the canary make Tom\'s hands shake one another and then sneak away to the tune of "Auld Lang Syne". Tom soon realizes his hands are shaking each other and chases both, but the canary escapes, while Jerry runs into the leg of a chair for the canary bird heart.  Tom catches Jerry and ties him to a toy train track, and then gets on the biggest train and activates it. The terrified canary grabs a bag with a bowling ball inside and carries it across the room to where the scene unfolds: Tom, with vicious glee, is approaching Jerry fast , who begins to say his prayers. However, when the canary cannot hold the bowling ball anymore, it falls out and crashes through the railway and the ground, in which the train plunges with Tom still aboard. The short ends with Jerry and the canary whistling "My Blue Heaven."'] ['In a music store, Mrs. Theodore von Schwartzenhoffen orders a player piano as a surprise birthday gift for her husband, Professor Theodore von Schwartzenhoffen, MD, AD, DDS, FLD, FFF&F. She tells the manager her address - 1127 Walnut Avenue - and he hires the Laurel and Hardy Transfer Company to deliver the piano in their freight wagon. After asking a postman for directions, and discovering the address is at the top of a very, very, very long stairway, the duo set about heaving the piano to the top. Their attempts to carry the piano up the stairs result in it rolling and crashing into the street below several times, often with Ollie in tow. During their first attempt, they encounter a lady with a baby carriage trying to go down the steps; in trying to let her pass, they knock the piano back down the stairs. After the lady laughs at them, Stan kicks her in her backside, causing her to punch him back and hit Ollie over the head with a milk bottle. Stan and Ollie then heft the piano back up the stairs. The angry lady tells a policeman on the corner, who kicks Ollie twice and hits Stan with his truncheon after the latter suggests the officer is "bounding over his steps" . Meanwhile, the piano has rolled down the steps again. Yet the two doggedly persist in carrying the piano up the stairs for a third time. Halfway up, they encounter the short-tempered and pompous Professor von Schwartzenhoffen, who in a fit of German rage screams at Stan and Ollie. Stan knocks the Professor\'s top hat down the stairs and into the street, where it is crushed by a passing lorry. The outraged professor goes off, threatening to have the two arrested. Finally, Stan and Ollie get the piano to the top - after which it rolls back down to the street again. They wearily drag the piano back up the stairs, and meet the postman by the house, who informs them they didn\'t have to lift the piano up the stairs, but only had to drive up the hill and stop in front of the house. Stan and Ollie promptly carry the piano back down the stairs, put it back in their wagon and drive it up the hill to the house. Finding no one home, they finally succeed in getting the piano in the house, making shambles of the living room while unpacking it. Meanwhile, the owner of 1127 Walnut Avenue - Professor von Schwartzenhoffen - returns and is outraged at what he finds, as he hates pianos. He attacks the piano with an axe, destroying it, but regrets his actions when Mrs. Von Schwartzenhoffen returns home and tearfully tells her husband it had been a surprise birthday present.'] ['Buster plays a drifter who cons his way into working at an amusement park shooting gallery.

The film opens with narration over the wreckage of Hannaford\'s crashed car, casting doubt as to whether the crash which killed him on his 70th birthday was really an accident. The narrator sets the tone for the film by telling us "This [film] was put together from many sources — from all that footage shot by the TV and documentary film-makers — and also the students, critics and young directors who happened to bring sixteen and eight millimeter cameras to his birthday party..." Just before his death, Hannaford was trying to revive his flagging career by making a "hip, with-it" film in the style of Antonioni, laden with gratuitous sex scenes and violence, with mixed results. At the time of Hannaford\'s party, this film  has been left unfinished after its star stormed off the set, for reasons not immediately apparent to the audience. The film includes extensive excerpts of this film-within-a-film, as well as excerpts of a documentary on Hannaford\'s life. After the titles, we see a screening of some incomprehensible parts of Hannaford\'s unfinished experimental film. The screening is being held to attract "end money" from clearly-unimpressed studio boss Max David . Hannaford himself is absent, and a loyal member of his entourage, the aging former child star Billy Boyle ([[Norman Foster  makes an inept attempt to describe what the film is about. David asks, "Jake is just making this up as he goes along, isn\'t he?" After an awkward pause, Boyle can only reply, "He\'s done it before." Intercut with this scene, we see various groups setting out for Hannaford\'s 70th birthday party at his Arizona ranch, including Hannaford and his young protégé Brooks Otterlake , a young, commercially successful director who has a talent for mimicking well-known celebrities.  One of the people they share their car with is the obnoxious cineaste reporter Mr. Pister , whose flurry of intrusive questions culminates in, "Mr. Hannaford, in the body of your film work, how significantly would you relate the trauma of your father\'s suicide?" and he is thrown out of Hannaford\'s car. Stranded in the desert, Pister hitches a lift on a bus that is taking crew and reporters to Hannaford\'s birthday party. Although there are many journalists in the bus, they are also carrying several dozen life-size clay dolls of Hannaford\'s leading man, taken from the set of the unfinished film. The scene is indicative of the experimental nature of the picture, and includes much overlapping dialogue: a tape recorder belonging to reporter Juliette Riche  playing back Hannaford\'s voice, while a member of Hannaford\'s entourage Pat  reads out an authoritarian anti-hippy diatribe of Hannaford\'s, fellow reporter Pister struggles to thread the tape back onto his reel-to-reel tape recorder, and at the same time, film footage of the scene is rapidly intercut with footage from Hannaford\'s film. Further scenes depict the festivities at Hannaford\'s party, including fireworks, assorted midgets, and a musical number with John Carroll leading a rendition of "The Glow-Worm." Many of the journalists attending are all brandishing cameras, and the film follows the perspectives of individual journalists as they follow Hannaford everywhere, even to the toilet, asking personal questions. In the second half of the film they begin querying Hannaford\'s sexuality and whether he has long been a closet homosexual, in spite of his macho public persona. Each camera\'s footage is displayed in a distinctive style, representing the perspectives of different directors and cameramen. Throughout the film, there is rapid inter-cutting between simultaneous conversations at Hannaford\'s party, so that the viewer hears a few lines of dialogue from one conversation, switches to another conversation, then another, before returning to more of the original conversation.  Several party guests comment on the conspicuous absence of John Dale , Hannaford\'s androgynous-looking, leather-clad leading man in his last film, whom Hannaford first discovered when Dale was attempting suicide by jumping into the Pacific Ocean off the Mexican coast. Meanwhile, guests are shown more scenes from the film in the private cinema Hannaford has at the ranch. The scenes of the film-within-the-film intercut throughout the film include: *A scene set in a Turkish bath, which plays over the opening titles. *John Dale\'s onscreen character pursuing "The red, red Indian"  on his motorcycle, with increasing ambiguity as to which of them is pursuing the other. These scenes involve extensive use of flat landscapes and plains; and tall, high-rise glass skyscrapers, the mirrors and windows of which form various optical illusions reminiscent of the \'hall of mirrors\' scene in Welles\' earlier The Lady from Shanghai.  *A graphic sex scene between Random and Kodar in a station wagon being driven through heavy rain, culminating in the driver of the car  throwing Kodar out. *A sexual dream sequence involving Kodar walking at least partially nude in front of a giant black phallus.  This short scene was directed by Kodar. *The violent death of John Dale\'s character in the film-within-the-film. *A graphic sex scene between Random and Kodar, filmed from below, looking through the bedsprings in the style of Russ Meyer. The scene takes place on a rusting bed in a deserted movie lot. Throughout this scene, Hannaford provides increasingly voyeuristic and intrusive/abusive off-screen direction, prompting an enraged and humiliated John Dale to storm off the set. As the party continues, Hannaford gets progressively drunker. He is washing his face in the bathroom when he tearfully breaks down in front of Otterlake, asking for the young director\'s help to revive his flagging career, and desperately trying to sober up before returning to the screening of his still-unfinished film. A power cut in the middle of Hannaford\'s party interrupts the screening mid-way. The party continues by lantern-light, and eventually reconvenes to an empty drive-in cinema, where the last portion of Hannaford\'s film is screened. Later in the film, Dale arrives at the party. At one point, a drunken Hannaford makes a pass at Dale, and is rebuffed. Hannaford has a history of seducing the wife or girlfriend of each of his leading men, but maintains a strong attraction to the leading men themselves. Hannaford then uses a rifle from his Indian trophy room to shoot several life-sized clay dolls of Dale. This is paralleled by a subplot about the unnamed actress playing "The red red Indian" seducing Dale at Hannaford\'s party and being rebuffed, leading to her shooting at him towards the end of the film. Dale is no longer alive by the end of the film. Having relocated to the drive-in cinema, intrusive journalist Juliette Riche asked Hannaford the most explicit questions of all about his sexuality. At this moment, Billy Boyle stops the film cameras, although with the soundtrack still running, and through a montage of still photos, we gather that Hannaford violently assaults Riche. The film\'s final scene features Hannaford\'s sports car - which he had originally bought as a present for Dale - crashing into the screen of the drive-in cinema, killing him. At the time, the screen had been projecting the end of Hannaford\'s new film, and the sun sets behind it. It is left ambiguous whether his death was the result of drunk driving or suicide. A monologue from Hannaford is heard in voice-over during the final scene: {{quote}} The film concludes as Hannaford\'s voice says, "Cut!"'] ['Friendly neighborhood policeman Kennedy the Cop warns the gang to stay away from an old abandoned house in the neighborhood. Instead, he suggests the kids go dig for buried treasure, which they proceed to do&mdash;in the basement of the old abandoned house.

Kennedy eventually turns up at the house to save the kids and apprehend the lunatic, but can hardly take care of himself.'] ['In their first film, Tom and Jerry are taxi drivers at the train station on a stormy day, waiting for a fare. A train comes up, and two identical-looking men come out. They both try to get them in the taxi. After the men are settled, Tom drives the men. It rained so much, a frog jumped in to taxi and went back again. They reach a castle, and the men walk in. Tom and Jerry run to the men to be paid, but are locked inside. Then, a cloud turns into a human-like figure with arms. He then plays crenellations as piano keys, and near towers act as pipes, similar to a pipe organ, and two trees play their own branches like piccolos. As they walk, Tom is mortified as Jerry is interested as a giant bat-like creature appears in front of them. They come to a room where a skeleton is cleaning itself. After this point, they were sure paranormal things are happening. Odd things that happen include: ghosts standing behind them, finding a skeleton playing a piano while another skeleton dances to the music, a glove dancing, and a blackface quartette of skeletons singing a song, which includes a few lines from versions of "Golden Slippers", such as a "long white robe" and a "starry crown", and to stop gambling. After these things had happened the two men walk in, and point at Jerry. Jerry lifts his shirt, and he realises he\'s a skeleton, too. Tom laughs, and he realises he is a skeleton, too. Tom is scared, and both men run for their lives, and the cartoon ends.'] ['A seasoned actor  discusses the current state of film while a group of young children sneak in with production equipment to film him.

Though his life seems mundane, he has trouble remembering things and the sights and sounds of the world are sometimes overwhelming. His life is narrated in several humorous and dramatic anecdotes, very gradually growing darker and terrifying as he appears to be suffering from a possibly fatal mental disorder . The split-screen windows and layered audio tracks slowly battle for attention on screen and begin to smother Bill. The film illustrates the struggle many people have with mental illness, in the inherent difficulty in deciding which muddled thought or distracted perception is most important and should be paid attention to.

Though Bob the Tomato thinks that Larry\'s now happy, the cucumber admits that he won\'t be happy until he has all the additional vehicles in the Soo-Vee line. Bob sees Larry\'s problem as a good theme for the episode. The French Peas Jean-Claude and Philippe then appear and segue the theme into their own story. The story introduces Madame Blueberry, a rich but perpetually "blue" woman who lives in a sparsely-decorated treehouse. Though her butlers  attend to her every whim, they find themselves unable to lift Blueberry out of her doldrums. The only happiness she seems to get is from looking at photographs of all the amazing possessions her neighbors own, which she keeps in various photo frames. One day, a trio of salesmen  arrive at Blueberry\'s treehouse to promote their new "Stuff-Mart," a department store, under the claim that they\'ve got anything and everything she needs to be happy. Though Bob has his doubts, Blueberry goes along with the sales pitch and follows them to Stuff-Mart. Madame Blueberry and her butlers follow the salesmen to the Stuff-Mart. Along the way, she sees a poor, but, happy girl celebrating her birthday with her parents who could only afford 1 piece of pie for her birthday dinner. Blueberry wonders why the girl is happy even with so little. She goes on and buys 1 of everything she sees in the store . She gets so many stuff that she accepts an offer to continue shopping while the stuff was delivered to her house. Loads of carts go out the door to her home for deliveries . During a lunch break, she sees Junior Asparagus being happy with his dad buying a ball for him at the "Stuff Mart," despite his disappointment over learning that his dad couldn\'t afford the train set he really wanted. Blueberry wonders how come the boy was happy even though he wasn\'t getting the 1 thing he really wanted and why she wasn\'t happy even though she was getting the many things she wanted. The Scallions return to her to take her to see toaster ovens. Seeing that she already had a wonderful home and two loyal friends in her butlers, Blueberry realizes her folly in not being thankful for what she had and tells the salesmen that she is done giving in to their materialistic temptations. When she leaves the Stuff-Mart, however, Blueberry sees her tree tipping over due to all the stuff inside her house weighing it down. Grabbing a shopping cart, Blueberry tries to catch up to the delivery peas, but is unable to stop the final delivery, a giant air compressor, from arriving at her house. The final heavy object proves to be too much for the poor tree house to handle: the back door forces itself open and dumps every one of Blueberry\'s purchases into the lake below. In turn, the sudden loss of weight causes the tree to fling Blueberry\'s house out of its branches, over the forest, and onto the ground, where it immediately collapses into a wreck. As the story draws to a close, Blueberry is with her butlers, the birthday girl, Junior, and their respective parents. Though homeless at the moment, Blueberry nonetheless is finally happy for having such caring people be with her. At last, the blue berry has understood that "a thankful heart is a happy heart".'] ['Woody ([[Danny Webb  stays behind to swim while the other birds in the forest migrate south for the winter.

Fudd is a waiter at the Mocrumbo and comes out to find that his next customer is Humphrey Bogart. Bogart lets Elmer know that he wants fried rabbit, within 20 minutes&mdash;or else! . This puts Elmer in a bind, as the restaurant is "fwesh out of wabbit." However, during his frantic search for one, Elmer hears the familiar sound of Bugs munching on some carrots in a corner of the kitchen. Elmer lets Bugs know that Bogart wants to "have" him for dinner. Bugs immediately dresses in a tailcoat and wants to have a peek at what is cooking. Elmer quickly puts a mirror into a pot. Bugs, taking a look inside, soon realizes that he himself is the main course. Bugs eventually manages to escape the kitchen, dressing like Groucho Marx in an attempt to fool Elmer&mdash;but Elmer is dressed as Harpo.

Bugs then makes his way back to the kitchen, where he revels in the audience\'s appreciation of his performance . Fudd then runs towards Bugs, and Bugs immediately pretends to be a waiter ordering pies and twice splatters Elmer in the face. The third time , Elmer throws the pie at Bugs, but he ducks and it sails out into the seating area, hitting Bogart in the face. Bogart walks into the kitchen, grabs Elmer and asks him, "Why did you hit me in the face wid a coconut custard pie wid whipped cream?" Bogart then warns Elmer that he has just 5 minutes to come up with his fried rabbit. Elmer searches frantically, but cannot find one in time. Bogart returns, and sticks his hand in his jacket menacingly. Elmer thinks he\'s about to die, but Bogart only pulls out a handkerchief to dab his forehead as he says resignedly, "Baby will just have to have a ham sandwich instead." Upon hearing "Baby", Bugs jumps out of his hiding place and takes his place as the main course , noting, "Remember, garçon, the customer is always right! If it\'s rabbit Baby wants, rabbit Baby gets!" before howling and wolf whistling at Bacall.'] ['This cartoon short is based on the fairy tale The Elves and the Shoemaker, set 150 years after that story took place .If the cartoon was made in 1956 , 150 years before that would be 1804-1806 Elmer Fudd is the progressive King of industrial Elves.

His elf helper tells him that the elves are helping an outmoded shoemaker, but Elmer points out that it\'s the 20th century. He tells his elf helper to get the elves back or he\'ll mark them AWOL, just before telling the elf helper that if he is turned into a mouse, he must say "Rumpelstiltskin". At the shop, the elf helper tells the shoemaker that he must take the elves back, but the shoemaker wants to stay in business. Unfortunately, his pet cat, Sylvester, uses the magic word, "Jehoshaphat" to turn Elmer\'s elf helper into a mouse and chases him around the shoemaker\'s shop. Saying "Rumpelstiltskin" changes him back to an elf, much to the disgust of Sylvester, who puts the elf helper down. The shoemaker puts Sylvester up so that he cannot interfere. Elmer comes to the shop and explains the role of capitalism and mass production to the shoemaker, who then agrees to use this knowledge to stay in business. Four months later, the shoemaker\'s little shop has literally become a shoe factory. Elmer comes back to see how the shoemaker was "pwogwessing", and the shoemaker says that he has gotten over 500 orders and next month his business will be expanding. This reminds him to come up with a name for his new boot line up, and he comes up with the new name:"Jehoshaphat Boots!", only this literally turns Elmer into a mouse, who forgets that Rumpelstiltskin is the magic word, and runs as Sylvester decides to chase him out of the factory and into the distance just as the cartoon ends with Elmer finally saying "Wumpewstiwtskin!"'] ['Elmer Fudd starts attempting to catch Bugs with a carrot on a fish hook, who turns the tables on Elmer by attaching the hook to his pants and "reeling" him in.

When Elmer tries to ambush Bugs with the piano, Bugs ends up playing the piano up to the point where Elmer is launched from the piano. He then tricks the shy Elmer onto the stage, forcing him into performing a high-diving act. This ends up being a high-diving act into a glass of water. Then, he prompts Elmer in a Shakespearean outfit through some classic acting emotive poses, seguéing into face-making, which draws a ripe tomato in the face from the jeering crowd. Then he tricks Elmer into doing a "striptease" down to his boxers .  Finally, Bugs disguises himself as a southern sheriff, just as a real one  arrests Elmer for "indecent southern exposure". Before leaving the theater, a Bugs Bunny cartoon begins on the movie screen and the sheriff decides to stay and watch it. Elmer appears to get wise when the cartoon shows the scene where Bugs disguises himself as the sheriff.

Tom then hears Mammy Two Shoes telling him that it is time to put the cat out for the night. Noticing that the weather outside is rather unpleasant, Tom craftily fakes a cold, pretending to sneeze violently. Mammy asks if Tom has a cold. Tom nods and sneezes again. Mammy has a change of heart and allows Tom to sleep inside for the night, but gives the cat a stern warning that she'd wash his mouth with soap if he was lying. Tom grabs an onlooking Jerry, who appropriately shoves a bar of soap in Tom's mouth. Tom spits out a multitude of soap bubbles and chases Jerry into his mousehole, but ends up with a mousetrap on his nose. When he takes it off, his nose rolls like a window shade.  Tom prepares to sleep on the living room floor, nose bandaged up. While Tom is asleep, Jerry enters the room with a small pot of red paint, painting several polka dots on his face after removing the bandage on Tom's nose. When Tom wakes up, Jerry convinces him that he has measles, showing evidence of a nationwide measles epidemic in the newspaper, and producing a mirror, showing Tom his own spotty reflection. Jerry consults Dr. Quack's medicine book and does a number of unorthodox treatments to the now hypochondriacal cat, such as placing a stethoscope next to a ticking alarm clock to intensify Tom's apparent heartbeat, then setting off the alarm. Later, Jerry tests Tom's reflexes, almost bludgeoning the cat with a hammer. As Tom bellows in pain, Jerry places a thermometer in Tom's mouth.

When he opens the door again, Tom is bright red and burning. Jerry quickly touches the hot cat and burns himself. Thinking quickly, he places Tom onto a baking tray and heads for the bathroom, giving the cat a cold shower. Tom later emerges from the shower, covered in towels and using hot-water bottles as sandals. He observes himself in the mirror, and notices that most of his spots have gone. As he wipes his forehead, the final spot is removed and transferred to his paw. Just then, Tom sees a small jar of red paint hidden in the corner, and realisation dawns on him; his mirror image changes to a jackass. Tom, after realizing that he was tricked, becomes furious and grabs a sword, ready to get back at Jerry. He finds the mouse sitting hunched-up with head in hands, looking very depressed somehow and Jerry only blinks at Tom apathetically when prodded with the sword's keen point. Only when Tom snatches him up does Jerry break out in genuine measles spots, which proliferate before Tom's horrified gaze. Tom quickly dashes in terror to the bathroom medicine cabinet and doses himself frantically with everything he can find , but little does he know that there is no cure for measles, while a sped-up version of George Frideric Handel's Dead March plays over. Both the cat and mouse are covered in spots from head to toe and are being quarantined by Mammy Two Shoes herself.

On his way back to the castle from grocery shopping, Sam complains how the king never thanks him for his hard work in having to pick up groceries and prepare meals three times a day, but instead whines that Sam takes too long with preparing the meals, much to Sam\'s annoyance . That drives Sam to the point where he insults the king behind the king\'s back. After Sam prepares his latest meal, which consists of "Cornish Hen a la Westchester" and "Prime Rib of Mutton au Jus with kreplach Sauce Bordelaise," the king just kicks the dishes away and orders Sam to take it all away. He then tells Sam he\'s fed up with having "variety" at his meals. Wanting something different for a change, the king orders Sam to fix him some hasenpfeffer. Sam agrees to carry out the king\'s request, but doesn\'t know what hasenpfeffer is. When Sam checks back just to make sure the king said the right word, the king answers the question by throwing a bowl of custard into Sam\'s face. While Sam is looking up the recipe, Bugs Bunny knocks on the door and explains that as he\'s one of the rabbits residing in the king\'s royal forest, he\'s come to borrow a cup of diced carrots. Sam just slams the door on Bugs and returns to the cookbook, only to discover that hasenpfeffer is a dish that includes a rabbit as one of the ingredients. Realizing who he just shooed away, Sam rushes out after Bugs. Sam manages to trick Bugs into thinking that the king has invited Bugs for dinner and agrees to help him prepare for dinner.

Bugs gets out of the pot and pretends to go off to another commitment, but Sam blocks the exit and threatens him with the meat ax, forcing Bugs to return to the pot . At this point, the king is starting to get impatient and whine that Sam is taking too long to make the hasenpfeffer. Realizing there\'s no time to cook Bugs, Sam just shuts him in the pot and serves him to the eager king. Just as the king lifts the pot lid, Bugs springs up and gives the king a kiss. After spitting out Bugs\' cooties, the king scolds Sam for serving him a raw and alive hasenpfeffer and orders him to take it back to the kitchen and prepare it the right way, or else Sam will be "drawn and quartered." Not wanting to face execution for his mistake, Sam shoves Bugs into the oven and orders him to stay there until the cooking time is up. Sam then pulls out an hourglass that gives the time for hasenpfeffer, prime ribs, fish, and fowl. While Sam\'s back is turned, Bugs escapes the oven  and leaves. As soon as the hourglass hits zero for hasenpfeffer, Sam thinks he\'s safe. Just as the king starts getting impatient and whining that Sam\'s taking too long again, Sam brings out the supposed hasenpfeffer and presents it to the king.

Sam jumps into his car and drives off to the airport with plans to hijack a plane to another country, where the police won\'t find him. The airport happens to be having an aircraft surplus sale and Bugs Bunny is taking a look at the biggest airplane on the lot. Bugs gets into the cockpit and starts pretending to be a pilot. Sam boards the plane and, orders Bug, at gunpoint, to take off. Before Bugs can protest that he is not a pilot, Sam threatens to blow his head off.

Sam begs the Head Devil to give him another chance, which the Head Devil gladly accepts and sends him back to the world of the living.

He knocks on the door and Bugs, slightly bemused by the addition to his property, opens it. The Coyote proclaims, in his very first spoken line of dialogue ever, that he is a genius, as well as being faster, taller, and stronger than Bugs, and that he intends to eat the rabbit. He goes on to advise Bugs that it is futile to try and escape, since Bugs "could hardly pass the entrance examinations to kindergarten", an insult Bugs does not seem to react to  An unimpressed Bugs replies, "I\'m sorry, Mac, the lady of the house ain\'t home. And besides, we mailed you people a check last week," then slams the door in Wile E.\'s face. The Coyote goes back to his cave hideout , asking himself: "Why do they always want to do it the hard way?" The Coyote\'s first plan to trap Bugs is to build a pressure cooker on top of the rabbit hole and cook Bugs alive. He chops up vegetables, throws them down the hole, adds an egg, a drop of cooking oil, some seasoning, tosses it into a salad, then places the pressure cooker on top. Bugs watches Wile E.\'s work from another hole , then walks up to him and asks "What\'s cookin\', Doc?" When informed that Wile E. is cooking "rabbit stew" , Bugs casually observes, "there\'s only one little thing wrong with it", that there is no rabbit . As Wile E. frantically looks under the cooker, Bugs gives him a big kick down the hole and sticks the cooker on top of Wile E. He then picks up a bat, goes back down the second hole, and clobbers the Coyote  at the other hole, prompting the Coyote to remark: "Well, back to the old drawing board." In the next scene, the Coyote prepares his second plan: the use of a chute for firing a cannon ball into Bugs\' hole. After the ball arrives in the hole via the chute from a cannon, Bugs uses a second chute to return the ball to the Coyote, where it explodes on target, causing the Coyote\'s plan to quite literally backfire on him. Bugs then goes to the Coyote\'s cave to claim that he is surrendering "on account of I cannot fight no more against such genius," but he wants Wile E. to sign as a witness to his last will and testament. He gives the Coyote the document and a "pen", which is really a burning stick of dynamite. Wile E. knows that it\'s dynamite and puts out the fuse . While he gloats , it is revealed that there is another fuse at the other end of the TNT stick, which explodes on cue. The Coyote then returns to his cave and builds a mechanical  lady rabbit that will be used as a decoy to trap Bugs.  Bugs, however, has anticipated this plan, and built an explosive lady coyote in response . Bugs detonates the coyote robot just as Wile is romantically embracing it. Then, because Wile E. was so distracted that he forgot about the rabbit robot , it explodes in his cave as well. The Coyote then creates an exploding flying saucer with a radarscope mechanism able to detect birds, mice, and rabbits. The disc flies to Bugs\' hole, but Bugs thwarts it by putting on a chicken mask. The disguised Bugs then writes in "Coyote" on the radarscope\'s target options and moves the dial there. The saucer speeds back to the Coyote\'s home, blew up the whole mountain to smithereens. The Coyote makes one last plan: While admiring his self-status as a "Super Genius," he fills a series of carrots with explosive liquid nitroglycerin inside his alternate home—a ramshackle shack. Bugs, using a tractor, drags the shack to the desert\'s railroad track, where a train is approaching. When the train hits the shack, all of the explosives in Wile E\'s stockpile explodes and launches him high into the air. "\'Wile E. Coyote - Super Genius\'", he groans in self-sarcasm while he was holding a tree branch on the edge of the cliff all burned up, finally admitting to himself that the rabbit has outwitted him. The Coyote, still dazed and covered in ash, returns to Bugs\' hole, rebuilds his door, knocks on it and admits defeat. "Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Mud," he says to Bugs before passing out.'] ['Junior Creative is about the corporate malevolence that can underlie the veneer of a self-consciously hip Advertising Agency.

Daffy goes to sleep, but Speedy has no intention of staying up for the whole night and ties a tripwire to the bedpost, also connecting it to the bell, so that if Daffy starts sleepwalking again the bell will wake up both Daffy and Speedy. Sure enough, Daffy begins sleepwalking and trips the bell, which wakes Speedy who then starts frantically ringing it himself to make it look like he was on guard. Afterwards, Daffy goes to sleep again, though not before Speedy makes him pay another five pesos for his continued services. As dawn breaks, Daffy starts sleepwalking again, but this time he gets out of bed on the other side and leaves the house the other side of the bed, which fails to make the bell ring. He sleepwalks into a construction site, and ends up at the top of an under-construction skyscraper. In the meantime, Speedy finally wakes up and realizes that Daffy isn\'t there. Speedy then frantically leaves the house in pursuit. Using his super-speed, Speedy gets to the construction site, and gets to the top of the skyscraper just in time to prevent Daffy from falling down a hole in the girders. Daffy then nearly walks off the edge of the structure, but is woken up by the bell of an ice cream salesman at street level. He still loses his balance though, and falls partway down the structure, getting left hanging on for life. Speedy lowers a noose down to Daffy and threads it over his neck, then drops the other end down to Daffy and tells him to pull himself up with it. Daffy does so, nearly choking himself in the process, but manages to set off a jackhammer when he gets back to the top of the structure and is thrown off it again. On his way down, Daffy manages to grab onto the minute hand of a clock built into the side of another building, but then the hour hand starts traveling around extremely fast, whacking Daffy on the head, then the clock explodes and throws him into another building, where he bounces off the canopies above its windows. He grabs onto one of the canopies, but it quickly breaks off and drops him onto some telegraph lines, which he in turn bounces off of. Speedy manages to grab a wheelbarrow, and catches Daffy before he hits the ground. Daffy passes out during his final fall, and Speedy quickly wheels him back home and drops him back into his bed, which results in Daffy being convinced that the whole thing was just a nightmare when he wakes up.'] ['The majority of the male mice in a Mexican village lament the fact that Speedy Gonzales has been getting in between them and the "pretty girls ."

It contains a series of gags, usually based on outrageous stereotypes and plays on words, and topical references, as a narrator  describes the action. This one is about a "tour" of a zoo  where the animals have nonsensical names, display anthropomorphic behavior, illustrate punnish gags, or any combination thereof: *Some animals are seen in their "natural settings": a wolf at someone\'s door; "a pack of camels" smoking cigarettes (underscored by "The Campbells Are Coming"; a North American Greyhound; "two bucks and five scents" ; and "two friendly Elks" . *The monkey house includes monkeys tossing peanuts to zoo patrons; a baboon and a man who look alike and who end up trading places; and a Capuchin yelling at the top of its lungs, to a lady who tries to feed him some peanuts in defiance of the "Do Not Feed the Animals" sign: "Hey, sister, can\'cha read?" *A ground-hog [sic], along with its shadow in a separate cage, both pacing in sync. *A skunk cage is a "scenter of interest"  with the observers keeping a safe distance; the skunk is seen reading How to Win Friends and Influence People. *A giraffe is being fed to the tune of the bugle "Mess Call"; the food chunks roll down its throat and into its stomach with the sound effects of junk crashing loudly. *White rabbits are seen "multiplying" - operating adding machines  *The bird house includes a "wise old owl", who seems reluctant to accept the label; a parrot who talks like a street tough and wants a beer instead of a cracker; and an "Alcatraz jail-bird", with a voice like Edward G.

The narrator asks, "What made you wild?", and in a very topical joke, the cat responds, "They called my name out at Bank Night and I wasn\'t there!", and resumes his crazy antics. *A running gag features Egghead teasing a ferocious lion, with the narrator repeatedly warning him to stop. Egghead slinks away, invoking Lou Costello\'s catch phrase, "I\'m a baaad boy!", but keeps returning. Finally, the lion is seen alone, and the narrator comments that Elmer has learned his lesson.

After many unsuccessful attempts to launch rockets to the moon , Professor Dingledong becomes the first man to reach the moon, but, two years later, hasn\'t returned to Earth. In the present day, at the Interplanetary Rocket Society, Professor P. Cosmo Clonk asks the other scientists if one of them will volunteer for the next manned mission to the moon. The scientists just look at each other until it boils down to Fido, the society\'s mascot, but Fido gulps and immediately pretends to have the measles. Professor Clonk tries to coax Fido to stop delaying the progress of science, but Fido, still refusing to go first tries pretending he isn\'t Fido and shows his master pictures of his family . Woody Woodpecker enters the scene as a volunteer telegram delivery man and presents a telegram to Professor Clonk, informing him of an overdue phone bill . Professor Clonk is offended by the telegram, but after Woody points out his volunteer work, this gives Professor Clonk an idea to have Woody be the next astronaut. Straight afterwards, at the rocket launching site, the society members wish Woody "bon voyage" and are immediately charred  as Woody blasts off in the rocket. While traveling through space, Woody opens the hatches to let a Sputnik satellite  pass through. The rocket then lands safely on the moon, where we see the remains of Professor Dingledong\'s rocket  and that Dingledong is still alive. Upon seeing the recently arrived spaceship, Dingledong rejoices at being rescued and gives Woody a rather mushy welcome by kissing him. Dingledong jumps at the idea of a woodpecker piloting a rocket, to which Woody states "Who were you expecting? Miss Universe?" Unaware that Woody is listening in, Dingledong makes a plan to hijack the rocket and leave Woody stranded on the moon. As part of the plan, Dingledong takes Woody on a tour of the moon. As he shows Woody a crater, Woody questions on how deep the crater is, to which Dingledong kicks Woody into the crater, making him fall off the moon on the other side. As Dingledong reaches Woody\'s rocket, he laments on having volunteered for the mission that led to his being marooned on the moon and justifies his recent actions to the audience by confessing that he\'s so homesick after spending two years stuck on the moon. Before Dingledong can board the rocket, Woody reappears and punches him with a boxing glove. Woody then chastises Dingledong for his actions and puts the key to the rocket down his feathers. Wanting the key, Dingledong chases Woody into the rocket. Just as it looks like Dingledong will corner Woody, Woody whips out an atom blaster ray gun and fires it at Dingledong. After the ray passes through him, Dingledong states it didn\'t do a thing, but soon finds out it did the hard way when his lower half runs away, making him call it back. Woody tries to flee into another section of the rocket, but Dingledong forces him at ray gunpoint to surrender the key. Woody gladly obliges and Dingledong kicks him off the rocket. Dingledong inserts the key, but a closeup reveals it\'s the key to the ejector seat, which launches Dingledong through the roof and into the air. Right after Dingledong states he made a boo-boo, he falls to the ground. Woody places a door on the ground and opens it so that Dingledong falls through the doorway and deep underground. After removing the door, Woody gets back aboard the rocket and prepares to return to Earth, but Dingledong  forces him at gunpoint to bring him back to Earth. Straight after the rocket blasts off, it leaves Dingledong behind, making him say "Well, that\'s the way the cookie crumbles." The rocket, however, returns and snags Dingledong onto its nose, making him burn his butt upon reentering the Earth\'s atmosphere. Upon arriving in Los Angeles, the rocket zips around the Los Angeles City Hall and crashes into the top floor, where the scientists of the Interplanetary Rocket Society  are having their latest meeting. Dingledong crashes through the table and right into Professor Clonk, at which both professors shout out each other\'s names to each other . In the last scene, angered that he\'d been sent to the moon for nothing, Dingledong ties Professor Clonk to a large firework rocket  and  lights the fuse, launching Professor Clonk to the moon. As Dingledong walks away and says goodbye to Woody, we see a firework rocket  tied to his back, which launches him to the moon after his former superior. Woody, holding a lit match in his hand, bids farewell to Dingledong, gives his trademark laugh, and an all knowing smirk at the fade-out.'] ['Jinbei Masuda, a Japanese Christian of the samurai class, draws his strength from his faith, family, and fencing.

Stephanie Preyde herself eloquently and unflinchingly narrates the film, describing the cumulative effects of the copious amounts of acid she took during that summer, the ongoing and Byzantine delusions which she suffered , the repudiation of her physical self, her eventual institutilization and journey to "normalcy." In this experimental documentary—set to a trippy acid jazz score—Preyde faces the ongoing repercussion of her trips: a possible misdiagnosis of bipolar disorder instead of temporary acid psychosis, and ironically, lifelong reliance on prescription meds.'] ["What began with an accidental glance over a written piece on the pheasantry’s eventual replacement took shape into a full-length documentary film. Dhodial Pheasantry, beyond everything else that it has done for conservation, and pheasant conservation in particular, put Pakistan on the map. The documentary aims at one thing alone - to leave its viewers with facts that allow them to decide for themselves whether it is Hazara University or Dhodial Pheasantry that is faced with an unjust inevitability. Adding a spiritual element to this film that investigates the nature of conservation is the story of Welsh ecologist Robert Whale. Robert Whale's decision to get married and stay back in Pakistan is an important element of the story being told. He made a deal with God, that if he caught a glimpse of the infamous Western Tragopan on film, he would embrace Islam. Now known as Rab Nawaz, he converted to Islam in 1998. Furthermore, the documentary unravels the on-going conflict of the pheasantry’s re-location to alternate land such as the Jaba Sheep Farmhttp://nwfp.gov.pk/Agriculture/AttDept/Dairy.php, in order to accommodate Hazara University’s eventual expansion. The farm’s director, Dr. Ghufranullah, has made clear that their livestock exceeds 600. The land that they have is enough only to cater to their own needs, as opposed to accommodating the needs of Dhodial Pheasantry as well. Hazara University wants to give preference to humans over birds. It is aiming for an eventual student count of 20,000 along the course of the expansion. Chief Conservatorhttp://nwfp.gov.pk/GoServices/NewsDetails.php?NewsId=110 of the Wildlife Department, Dr. Mumtaz Malikhttp://www.mardan.com/id105.html is concerned with the process of shifting habitats. Sometimes, birds can die as a result of tremendous stress level, which is incomparable to human stress level. Another huge issue is reports that the poultry farm that used to exist at the Jaba location earlier experienced bird flu and other diseases. As a result, entire flocks of poultry were wiped out. This is reinforced by the Zareef Khan Foundationhttp://www.zkf.org.pk/’s president, Abid Zareef, whose NGO works for education empowerment. He maintains that there is the risk of transmission of both sheep and pheasant diseases. There is more danger in the spreading of diseases as there are no crosswinds because the location is surrounded by hills. The film exposes all sides of the issue with a variety of stakeholder perspectives that sheds light on both the advantages and disadvantages of this inevitable relocation."] ["The film is set in middle class Edwardian England. Conradin, an orphan, lives with his legal guardian and aunt, Augusta. She is a sadistic figure who oppresses and controls him, on the pretext that he might die because of a genetic blood disorder. His only companions are a Houdan hen called Henrietta, which he adores, and a ferret named Sredni Vashtar, which he keeps hidden in a shed at the back of the garden. Conradin reads history books about Actaken Cults, although his aunt has forbidden him to learn history. He imagines that the ferret is a bloodthirsty god, Sredni Vashtar. Inspired by his reading, he makes offerings of bloody entrails and red berries to the ferret. One day, his aunt discovers Conradin's Houdan hen and takes it away. Very distressed, Conradin begs his god Sredni Vashtar to grant him one prayer. Shortly afterwards, his aunt finds the key to the shed where the ferret lives. She goes to the shed, while Conradin waits in the house. The ferret appears in the garden with blood on its muzzle. Distressed cries from members of the household are heard.

In addition, the brothers were working separately, rather than as a team, and did not incorporate their trademark comic personalities for which they later become famous. Harpo played the hero, a detective named Watson who "made his entrance in a high hat, sliding down a coal chute into the basement". Groucho played an "old movie" villain, who "sported a long moustache and was clad in black", while Chico was probably his "chuckling [Italian] henchman". Zeppo portrayed a playboy who was the owner of a nightclub in which most of the action took place, including "a cabaret, [which allowed] the inclusion of a dance number".

Shemp grabs a nearby fire hose and sprays the entire gang, soaking them. Moe and Larry quickly grab Barker\'s coat  and get the cell keys to Nell, who frees her sisters. Barker ends up dying of heart failure at the Poker table, and his irate gang throw Larry in the cell with plans to kill him at sunrise. Moe and Shemp attempt to free Larry using every tool they can find, while the girls ride for help. After freeing Larry, the trio stumble upon a suitcase full of old, Southern-style clothing. They then quickly change outfits to disguise themselves from Barker\'s gang, but a gang member  recognizes them in a heartbeat. The boys flee the saloon, and scurry away to hideout outside of town. Just as they are cornered by Barker\'s gang, Shemp takes off his gun belt, and, now serving as an ad hoc ammunition belt, puts it through a meat grinder. The increased firepower scares the gang away, and the Stooges emerge victorious.'] ["The film is a tale about a small band of contumacious boys and girls that live in a hidden village on a faraway beach; they are the Ivory Rebellion, a feral group of children that are fighting from oppression against an evil queen named Johanna, and her ruthless Onyx Empire. Like Peter Pan & The Lost Boys, the rebels have shunned society and live completely free of parents and authority figures. They're existence, albeit a simple one, is entirely devoid of technology, minus simple firearms and an ancient tube radio. Surrounding their beach is a border, the land across from which is forbidden and belongs to the Onyx Empire. For the longest time a treaty was set forth, stating that no one from either side shall cross said border, but in a last-ditch effort to induct the boys and girls of the Ivory Rebellion, Queen Johanna has halted all supply shipments into their village. The rebels are running low on food, and with the threat of starvation, are forced to make a decision that could cost them everything."] ['The Subject  one day receives an email advertising a product called "Praemus", described as "The cheaper, faster and better way of using the internet." After the Subject buys Praemus, he advises his friends to get it also. He also notices the mysterious connection unit, which connects to his computer by sticking to it. The Subject then sends an email complaining about Praemus. He complains that the unit claims he was online for 200 hours in a week, and other various problems with his computer, such as his monitor vibrating, blasts of static electricity and his screen shutting down, meaning he has to send his email from an internet cafe. The Subject gets an email back saying that this is the first time the Praemus system has done this, and that he should try turning the computer off and on again. However, unknown to him, there is no one working in the Praemus office. The Subject responds by saying he does not know how to turn the system off. His friend, who normally helps him with his computer, is reluctant to get involved. Later, other problems begin to develop for the Subject, as his cat goes missing. Praemus send another complicated email explaining what to do. Whilst he reads the manual and email explaining it, his daughter begins to play with matches. The Subject then responds again saying that he tried to remove the unit, but he got badly burned when he touched the glowing Praemus logo. He continues to complain that the company keeps sending him bills, despite the fact they are not helping him. The Subject then begins to have nightmares about the unit. Praemus then send an email saying that if he damages the unit, it will result in legal action. The Subject says that they were the ones who told him to interfere with the unit. He then goes on to say that there was some sort of "dinking sound" coming from the unit. Later, the unit tries to connect with his head and sell him Praemus Life Insurance. The Subject then goes on to explain that the other units are harming the friends to whom he recommended the Praemus service. Their hands also get burned and their units also start moving. However, The Subject buys the Praemus Life Insurance. His wife leaves a note on the computer monitor in an envelope with "John" written on it. She wrote that he could take the unit and shove it and that she was taking their daughter and to not try and find them. As his life deteriorates, he threatens in an email that he will begin "legal proceedings". However, as he types this, the computer refuses to display the characters onscreen. In frustration, he hits the keyboard with his head, which opens a new window on his computer. The window is a dialog box displaying the setup options for Praemus. The options are not related to the computer, but to himself and aspects of his life. Options displayed include, "Friends", "Spouse", "Children", "Sanity", "Pets" and "Acumen", all marked "Off". As soon as he tries to change one of the options, the computer turns itself off, and he has a heart attack. Praemus send an email to the Subject\'s wife saying they were sorry at hearing the news of the heart attack. The Subject\'s heartbeat then appears to stop, and the light on the unit fades away, but it turns out the heart monitor is not working. The monitor is also made by Praemus. Finally, the Subject wakes up.'] ['Three filmmakers go into the woods to film a movie. They were never found. This is their surviving videotape.http://www.oentertainment.com/InsaneO/Thumbs/blairthumb/index.html Stressy, a college student, has put an ad in the newspaper for some student filmmakers to help her go into the woods to shoot a documentary about the Blair Thumb. They then drive around town to interview people about the Blair Thumb. The first woman they interview tells them that she believes in the Blair Thumb to be a spirit that haunts the woods, and that she wouldn\'t be caught dead in the woods. Then she\'s shows her baby to them, who is possessed by Satan. The next person is a man who says kids have been disappearing in the woods, comparing the disappearances to the magic acts of David Copperfield. The next person they interview is an unhelpful pirate. Then they move on to interviewing the famous one-eyed thumb, who says "ee-hoo!" The next person they interviews is a local fisherman that says part of the Legend of the Blair Thumb: "There are these twins, the Briarly twins, I think they\'re twins. \'Twins should look alike.\' They went into the woods, been there hundreds of times, but this time they got lost. Couldn\'t find their way. Then they saw this woman...she was up in the air, floatin\'. She took their heads, switched them, like it was a sick game. Then she took their bodies, she switched them too. They came out looking zacly\' the same, but we all knew, they\'ve been all switched up." With enough information to go into the woods, Jish makes a pit stop to get some food. A gigantic marshmallow in his case. Now in the woods, Vic and Jish are shown taking a piss. Stressy cries, "What are you doing?" Vic says, "You told us to." Stressy replies, "No, I didn\'t, I said "kiss" before the first shot we kiss the slate!" Jish starts laughing. Vic replies, "Sorry, ok? I heard you wrong. Kiss, what\'s the difference?" Vic looks at the slate covered in piss. Stressy makes a video about a graveyard, wondering how the bodies got under the grave stones and what "freakish creature" carved and engraved them. They finally arrive at the woods. After walking a little ways, Vic and Jish start freaking out because Stressy doesn\'t have a real map. After calming them down, Stressy moves onward. Once they are at Hangnail Rock, Stressy tells the next part of the Legend of the Blair Thumb: "The search party went into the woods, in search of the five lost victims. Upon reaching Hangnail Rock, the torture inflicted on these brave men unfolded. Each was bound to each other, positioned one behind the next. Each man\'s hand was in the next man\'s pants. The men promptly turned and asked the search party to leave, and mind their own business. Hours later the men were found, decapitated, and very tired. The search party left to find a sheriff, but upon return the bodies were gone. All that was found, was a Streisand CD, and a mini-disk single of "It\'s Rainin\' Men." That night, the three hear weird noises, and they are chased by a shark. The shark tries to bite off Stressy\'s arm, and then moves over and attacks Vic. The next day, while they are walking, Jish notices that he has a weird substance on his stuff. Vic claims that Jish has been singled out and that he\'s glad it\'s not him. Further on, chaos ensues when it becomes apparent that Stressy has lost her fake map. Soon, they begin to think that they\'re going in circles. Then they discover that someone took Stressy\'s car. Soon after, they see the Blair Thumb\'s symbol made from a giant stick. Everything instantly becomes dark. That night, in the tent, Jish plays a prank on Stressy and Vic by shaking a bush. He explains that there were sticks in the trees, some kids ripped off their car went for a joy ride and says there is no Blair Thumb. However after this he is kidnapped by something and Vic and Stressy chase after him. In the dark Vic and Stressy stand still and quiet hoping not to get kidnapped and Vic feels up Stressy. The next day, Stressy and Vic find Jish\'s body. He has been cut in half; only his legs and groin area remain. That night, Stressy makes a video notice of her. Crying she says she\'s scared and apologizes to Vic\'s mom because he\'s scared, freaked out, and to Jish\'s mom, because he\'s "dismembered and everything". She says she loves her parents and Ricky Martin and says she\'s scared to close and open her eyes, squint and cross them. Then, Stressy and Vic hear Jish\'s voice and head after it. They pass by a sign that says "Dead House --->" without a second thought. They enter the house and Jish\'s voice says he\'s upstairs, so they head upstairs. Once they\'re upstairs, Jish\'s voice says he\'s downstairs. The two get separated on the way down. As Vic says something he gargles like something had killed him. Stressy screams and heads down the stairs still screaming. Then, Vic says, "Jeez, can\'t a guy even take a leak?" Frankenthumb then appears, and the two mistake him for the Blair Thumb. They ask if they can go, and he replies, "No, I kill. We party first?" They agree and a disco ball comes down. They dance. Jish\'s torso shows up, then the credits begin.'] ['Two romantic couples, consisting of four teenagers, decide to spend a weekend together located in a remote cabin found in the woods.

The other couple, Scotty  and Shelly, remain at the cabin playing Monopoly to pass time. During their lunch, Bruce announces to Ellen that they\'re camping on a Indian Burial Ground. Ellen is concerned, but Bruce assures her that they will be fine aslong as they don\'t disturb the graves of the dead. Bruce then explores the area and discovers an ancient dagger belonging to the Indians. Ignoring his own advice, he takes the dagger with him. After lunch, Ellen takes a nap. When she awakes, she finds Bruce missing and wonders into the woods looking for him. To her horror, she finds Bruce\'s dead body, horrible mutilated with apparent knife wounds. She is then startled by the presence of an demonic entity hiding within the woods, and quickly runs back to the cabin. While fleeing, she is attacked by unseen forces.

While being strangled, Ellen picks up Bruce\'s mutilated hand which is still holding the dagger found from before, and she uses it to stab Bruce.

Daffy Duck is fed up with comedy and wants to try a dramatic act instead. He offers a script to the Warner Brothers executive "J.L.", called The Scarlet Pumpernickel, which he wrote himself  As Daffy reads the script to J.L., the cartoon cuts away to various scenes and then back to J.L.\'s office. Each time, Daffy announces a page number. By the cartoon\'s end, the script has exceeded 2 thousand pages . In this script, the clumsy Scarlet Pumpernickel  must save the Fair Lady Melissa from being married to a man she does not love, the Grand Duke ([[Sylvester  under the Lord High Chamberlain\'s  orders. Melissa loves Scarlet, but her happy mood is extinguished in a heartbeat when the Chamberlain orders her to "Keep away from that masked ma-d-d-d-d-a-des-fradle-d-d-d-d... that masked stinker!". The Chamberlain gets a brilliant plan and decides to marry Melissa to the Grand Duke in exchange for killing the Scarlet Pumpernickel. As planned, the Scarlet Pumpernickel is drawn to town to interrupt the wedding. He arrives disguised as a noble and uses the disguise to research and develop his plan for rescuing Melissa. Storming the wedding ceremony as she is walking up the aisle, he is instantly successful as Melissa tears herself from her father\'s arms and runs from the chapel, dragging Scarlet with her . Scarlet takes her back to the inn where he was staying, and leaves briefly. The Grand Duke stops for respite at the inn and spots Melissa on the staircase. He chases her and is bearing down upon her when Scarlet swings in. Notably in this segment of the plot there is a running gag in which Daffy compares his own daring stunts with those of Errol Flynn. The Grand Duke and the Scarlet Pumpernickel engage in an intense duel, but no conclusive ending is given as to who ultimately wins the battle. Daffy, as the scriptwriter, having only thought of the beginning and middle of the story, and being pressured by the enthusiastic "J.L.", overdoes the ending as an unlikely series of random and accelerating natural disasters, including skyrocketing food prices , to which surprisingly, J.L. asks, "is that all?" At his wit\'s end, Daffy shoots through his hat in exhaustion, commenting, "It\'s getting so you have to kill yourself to sell a story around here".

There we are presented with a stark description of the hard life of this young girl and the dismal social conditions in which she lives. Punam's mother died when she was only five. She was left with her father, her newborn sister Rabina and her two–year–old brother Krishna. The Tamang children see little of their father because he works from sunrise to sundown in a rice factory, in order to earn enough money for their school fees , and so during the daytime Punam assumes the roles of head of the family, caregiver and homemaker.

She does not "rescue" the eaten grandmother at all. In fact she eats her flesh as well, even after being warned by the cat. Combined with the teasing of the wolf after she escaped to make him follow her this short movie presents an image of "Little Red Riding Hood" that is mildly put: "not entirely innocent." As such the movie is clearly based on one of the earliest version of the Little Red Riding Hood fairytale, known as "The False Grandmother."'] ['The Stooges are troubadours in medieval times.

The two chase through the huts and across the pier until Jerry stops at the end of the pier while Tom goes off the end. The cat looks back to see Jerry waving at him and can barely turn back around before he slams into a porthole, taking on its shape, and then falling into the sea to meet the shark once again. Tom swims out of the way and the shark continues to snap at him. The cat climbs a ladder while the shark eats through the wood columns under the pier. The shark swims back and takes a leap towards the cat on top of the pier and is smacked on the head with an oar before falling back into the water. It emerges and glares at Tom as the cat taunts him once again... only this time the shark leaps out of the water and grabs Tom  in its jaws. Jerry peers through the resulting hole at the terrifying situation below: Tom is hanging onto the oar, which braces the shark's mouth open. He breaks this brace, but Tom uses his legs to brace instead, staving off doom for a little longer. Fortunately, Jerry saves him by dumping an entire canister of pepper into the shark's mouth, causing the leviathan to sneeze and launch itself around the water and into the can factory, turning into a big can with his frowning picture on it. Jerry relaxes and gets a halo for his good deed, but an ungrateful Tom grabs him and pops Jerry's halo with devil horns that appear on his head, chuckling evilly. Jerry chuckles innocently and sneezes himself out of the cat's hand, off his horns, and into the water, immediately followed by the cat. Tom scans the scene only to find another shark fin on a beeline towards him! Tom panics and swims away at lightning speed, with the fin keeping pace. The fin, however, is actually Jerrys creation, who is now shown swimming underneath the water. Jerry turns his head towards the camera with an evil grin on his face and grows his own devil horns as he continues to swim after the cat."] ['No prints of the film have been preserved so the film can be considered a lost film. The original screenplay has also been lost. However, some plot descriptions are still known based on contemporary newspaper advertisements of the film. As the name would indicate, the film tells about two local men who are making moonshine in the woods. A customer comes to them, and while sampling the product they start a game of cards, which eventually leads to a fight. While the fight is going on, the local police shows up and arrests the makers while the customer manages to escape.Translated and paraphrased from an original advertisement for the film, as quoted by Hans Kutter in Uutisaitta magazine .

Bugs has himself mailed to Washington DC, where a supercilious game commissioner explains that the bounty is so low because, while foxes and bears are "obnoxious" animals who damage property, "rabbits are perfectly harmless". Bugs vows to prove that he can do just as bad and storms out, slamming the game commissioner\'s door so hard that the glass in it shatters.

Very magical, he could fly as well as pass through small openings. While travelling through the air, the warlock found a studio where actors are making auditions while others are doing rehearsals. As he entered, he saw a lady chimp weeping. The warlock approached her and asked why she was crying. Speaking unintelligibly, the chimp told him she desperately wanted to sing at the audition and possibly make it to concerts. Unfortunately, her tongue was knotted, thus she couldn\'t even say a simple word. Feeling sorry for the chimp as well as falling in love with her, the warlock decides to help out. To assist his love interest, the warlock placed a turn table in the chimp\'s skirt where she will lipsync while the record plays the song. The chimp sets foot on the audition stage and performs her act although it wasn\'t a smooth one. The record repeated a line so many times and even slowed down. Nevertheless, the studio staff who were watching didn\'t seem to mind. When the record stopped in the middle of the song, the warlock secretly came to her aid and turns the phonograph\'s cluster. The song continues and the chimp was "singing" again. She even managed to do well on the final lines, much to the delight of those in attendance. As the chimp happily gets down from the stage, the overjoyed warlock decides to congratulate her with an embrace. Much to the warlock\'s surprise, however, the chimp sidesteps him and walks to the other guy standing behind. That other guy is none other than Oswald the Lucky Rabbit. Feeling insulted by this, the warlock grabs the chimp and takes her to a secret room within the studio. Upon reaching his secret place, the warlock decides to play the organ of the room. As he plays, he advised the chimp not to take off his mask. Curious of why she should not, the chimp opted to do so as she tiptoed towards the warlock. As she removes the mask of her captive, the chimp was surprised to find out that the warlock\'s face had no skin or flesh, and is therefore a skeleton in garments. Oswald somehow managed to locate the secret room and knocks on the door loudly. Disturbed by the noise, the warlock leaves the chimp inside and decides to confront the rabbit. Seeing the warlock fly toward him, Oswald ran away as quickly as he could. On his getaway, Oswald stumbled and falls into a hole. Upon landing into the bottom floor, the rabbit was bumped by a few large lizards that passed by. Oswald then thought his troubles were over but more still await as the warlock followed him there. Instead of tormenting the rabbit, the warlock chooses to just ask a riddle. He asked "What does the chicken say when it lays a square egg?" Not sure of an answer, Oswald gives up and admits not having any idea. The warlock then slaps Oswald in the face, causing the rabbit to say "Ouch!" The warlock also discloses to Oswald that "Ouch!" was the answer and he elatedly disappears. From there, nobody saw the warlock again.'] ['The barn dance of the title is the occasion which brings together Minnie Mouse and her two suitors: Mickey and Peg-Leg Pete. The latter two and their vehicles are first seen arriving at Minnie\'s house in an attempt to pick her up for the dance. Mickey turns up in his horse-cart while Pete in a newly purchased automobile. Minnie initially chooses Pete to drive her to the dance but the automobile unexpectedly breaks down. She resorts to accepting Mickey\'s invitation. They are later seen dancing together, but Mickey proves to be a rather clumsy dancer as he repeatedly steps on Minnie\'s feet. She consequently turns down his invitation for a second dance. She instead accepts that of Pete, who proves to be a better dancing partner. Mickey then attempts to solve his problem by placing a balloon in his shorts. That apparently helps him to be "light on his feet" and he proceeds to ask Minnie for another dance. She accepts and is surprised to find his dancing skills to have apparently improved. Pete soon discovers Mickey\'s trick and points it out to Minnie. Minnie is visibly disgusted by this attempt at deception. As a result, she leaves Mickey and resumes dancing with Pete, leaving Mickey crying on the floor. This short is notable for featuring Mickey turned down by Minnie in favor of Pete. It is also an unusual appearance of the Pete character; previously depicted as a menacing villain, he is portrayed here as a well-mannered gentleman. In addition, Mickey was not depicted as a hero but as a rather ineffective young suitor. In his sadness and crying over his failure, Mickey appears unusually emotional and vulnerable.'] ["Oswald is a hair stylist and runs a barber shop. His first customer is a shaggy terrier, and Oswald goes to give it a haircut. Every time Oswald shaves some hair from the terrier's back, the hair kept regrowing. In time, Oswald found out that the little dog has been drinking a bottle of hair-growing liquid while he was shaving. He then took away the bottle and continued working. Though all he intended to is to give the terrier a little trimming, Oswald made the dog almost completely hairless. His second customer is a hippo who came to have some chin shaving which Oswald provided easily. The next patron is an elephant who seems to need a trunk makeover. Oswald ironed the elephant's trunk and curled it with some tongs. The elephant blew its trunk like a party horn and appears to be satisfied by it. Oswald then came to a bear who arrived to have a manicure. To make himself more charming, Oswald puts on a skirt and some lipstick. He then smoothed the bear's sharp claws with an automatic nail-filing wheel. Because of the feminine outfit the rabbit was wearing, the bear thought Oswald was a girl and therefore falls in love with him. Oswald was then asked by the love-stricken bear to have a ride in the latter's car but Oswald declined. To make the rabbit get in, the bear lured Oswald using a lollipop. The plan worked and Oswald was in the vehicle sitting beside his client. They went off in the car, leaving the barber shop and exiting the city. While they were riding through an open field minutes later, the bear picks up Oswald with two hands and starts kissing the rabbit constantly, much to Oswald's dismay. Oswald was able to get out of the bear's grasp and jumps off the car. Oswald goes on running with the bear in the car chasing. The chase continued even when night had fallen. It ended when they came across a long fence. Having enough of the bear's affection, Oswald confesses he is actually a guy as he takes off his skirt and wipes off the lipstick. The bear was disgusted and drives away. Oswald is finally left in peace."] ['The people of the town of Hamelin are celebrating the high rat population being driven from the town.

While he sleeps, Dr. Jekyll sneaks into his apartment and takes a swig of his Hyde Potion. As expected, he morphs into Mr. Hyde and laughs maniacally, waking up Sylvester, but when Sylvester looks into the window to see who\'s there, Mr. Hyde quickly reverts back to Dr. Jekyll, who then leaves his apartment. Sylvester just laughs it off and goes back to sleep. A few minutes later, Sylvester wakes up and sees some pigeons landing on the ledge on the other side. He decides to catch them for his lunch and sneaks up quietly on them, but the pigeons spot him and fly off just as he pounces, nearly falling off the ledge in the process . At that moment, Tweety Pie appears, struggling to stay airborne while flying and manages to land on the ledge . As he spots Sylvester, Sylvester tries to catch him, but Tweety escapes into Jekyll\'s apartment and hides in the Hyde formula. As Sylvester comes in looking for Tweety, the bottle shakes  and Tweety pops out, having morphed into a giant monster bird. As Sylvester demands that Tweety come out of hiding, Hyde Tweety taps Sylvester on the shoulder, causing him to turn around  and, literally, fall to pieces at the sight of him. Sylvester runs out of the apartment and tries to escape down the elevator, but it takes a long time to respond to the button and just when it looks like Hyde Tweety will capture Sylvester, he suddenly morphs back into normal Tweety. As soon as Sylvester sees him, Tweety immediately runs back into the apartment and shuts the door. Sylvester runs up demanding Tweety to open the door or else he\'ll break it down, but just as he takes a running start  and reaches the door, Sylvester finds himself face to face with Hyde Tweety. In a Freleng door gag, Hyde Tweety pursues Sylvester into another apartment where he morphs back into regular Tweety and Sylvester chases Tweety into another apartment where Tweety reverts back to Hyde Tweety. In the middle of chasing Sylvester down the hall, Hyde Tweety changes back to Tweety so it looks like Tweety is chasing Sylvester. As Sylvester suddenly wises up, Tweety runs ahead and fakes going into another apartment by opening and closing a door. Sylvester reaches the door, but falls down a shaft, with which a sign reveals it\'s an elevator under repair. Sylvester manages to get back to the upstairs floor, but Tweety changes back to Hyde Tweety and pursues Sylvester to a window. At the window, Sylvester sees its a hundred foot drop to the ground. As Hyde Tweety comes closer, Sylvester threatens to jump, but justifies to the audience that it\'s a better choice than facing Hyde Tweety\'s wrath. As Hyde Tweety gets closer, Sylvester carries out his threat, but Hyde Tweety flies out and catches Sylvester. While flying, he suddenly reverts back to Tweety, who then struggles to hold the weight of Sylvester, despite Sylvester\'s urgings to fly faster. Sylvester manages to grab a couple of Tweety\'s feathers and gets the idea to use them to slow his fall, which he does when he flaps them. As soon as Sylvester lands safely, he spots Tweety falling to the ground and opens his mouth, expecting Tweety to fall into it, but Tweety quickly reverts to Hyde Tweety and crashes onto Sylvester, knocking him out. No sooner does Hyde Tweety begin looking for Sylvester than he reverts back to cute little Tweety, just as Sylvester starts screaming for help. Realizing he\'s not being threatened, Sylvester opens his eyes and discovers Tweety on his back. Tweety tries to escape, but Sylvester immediately captures him and takes him to another apartment building across the street. Once in an apartment\'s kitchen, Sylvester tells Tweety that he\'s locking the door and tossing the key out the window to keep Tweety in and the "goon" out, which he does. He then puts Tweety between two slices of bread . Tweety tries to squirm his way out, but Sylvester pushes him back under and puts a sugar bowl over the sandwich to weigh it down . However, while Sylvester looks in a cupboard for ketchup, Tweety suddenly reverts back to Hyde Tweety. Not finding any ketchup, Sylvester decides to have the sandwich without ketchup, but just as he quickly sees that Tweety and Hyde Tweety are one and the same, Hyde Tweety suddenly opens his mouth and eats him. Sylvester quickly escapes and, while struggling to open the locked door, shouts out for help as Hyde Tweety  prepares to stalk him. Just then, Sylvester wakes up on the ledge of Jekyll\'s apartment and quickly sees that the Tweety-Hyde Tweety affair was nothing more than a bad dream. At that moment, Tweety comes flying in struggling to stay airborne and gives the same remark about flying he did in Sylvester\'s dream.

Desiring to attain \'speed\', Alexander heads to the woods with allies Philotas and Hephaestion, where he tames a wild man-eating horse. There he meets and befriends Cleitus and Ptolemy, recruiting them to join his cavalry. Macedonia heads to war with Athens, led by King Philip and his top advisers, Attalus, Parmenion  and Antipater. Philip becomes concerned with Alexander\'s absence, but Alexander and his cavalry arrive at the last moment, exploiting a break in the Athenian lines and leading Macedonia to victory. After their defeat, Athens ambassadors head to Persia, where they hope to align with new king Darius III. Alexander and his friends however sneak in as Athens slaves then kill the guards, causing Persia to think that Athens is betraying them. While Ptolemy is caught and suspended in the air, Alexander is able to save him from execution at the last minute by releasing all the horses in the city from their stables. While in Persia Alexander also meets a woman named Roxanne. Attalus tricks Philip into thinking that Olympias and Alexander are trying to betray him. Philip banishes Olympias and marries Attalus\'s daughter Eurydice, who gives birth to a son that Philip desires to become king instead of Alexander. Philip holds a great ceremony to present his new prince to the masses and also constructs a huge golden statue of himelf, declaring himself a God. During the ceremony however the statue crumbles and a guard hypnotized by Olympias assassinates Philip. Following Philip\'s death Alexander ascends to King and Attalus is executed. Athens plots to fight back against Macedonia, doubting Alexander\'s strength, but relents once Macedonia defeats Thebes in battle. Alexander places severe demands on Athens but relents on most of them after meeting with the philosopher Diogenes. Alexander next plots an attack on Persia and starts leading his troops there. Around this time Parmenion reveals to Philotas a secret about Alexander, that prior to his birth Olympias proclaimed that he would destroy the world. In addition, Aristotle sends his niece, Cassandra, to join Alexander\'s cavalry. Macedonia\'s forces continue to head through Persia\'s territories with multiple victories. Along the way Alexander recruits the doctor Phillipas to join him after undoing \'Gordian\'s Knot\' which has been said can only be undone by the King. In their next battle with Persia, Macedonia\'s troops are hopelessly outnumbered by Persia\'s which are 10 times that of Macedonia\'s, but Darius tells his forces to retreat when members of the Pythagorean Cult intervene. During the battle Philotas falls off his horse and has a vision of Olympias summoning demons. While in Egypt Alexander meets Dinocrates, a member of his army who tells him of the great city he\'d prefer to create there, Alexandria. Alexander has a vision of himself being in Alexandria 100 years after his death where he visits the place where he was entombed by Ptolemy. Before leaving Egypt Alexander and his men visit the Temple of Ammon where they are told that Alexander will be killed by the one he trusts the most. Ptolemy witnesses a separate prophecy, that he will become Great King of the World. Plotting with Persia, Pythagorean cult members make another attempt on Alexander\'s life but he is able to fight them off. Darius leads Persia\'s armies against Macedonia\'s. Aristotle meanwhile meets with Diogenes, requesting the Plato-Hedron, the device which contains the knowledge of the entire world. Diogenes claims however that he tossed it aside. The two watch as the battle continues. The Macedonian army gains new strength when there is an eclipse of the moon, and the Plato-Hedron appears and ascends to the heavens. As the battle nears its conclusion, Alexander kills Darius, defeating the Persians once and for all. With Persia now part of his empire, Alexander recruits Sagibarzanes, Darius\'s former adviser to become a top adviser of his. The Macedonian army becomes concerned that Alexander wants to continue heading east rather than return to Macedonia. Philotas dismisses their complaints but doesn\'t tell Alexander. Aristotle is also concerned with Alexander\'s actions and tells Cassandra that she will have to kill him should he continue to push eastward. Phillipas, secretly a member of the Pythagorean cult plots with them to kill Alexander during his wedding to Roxanne through the use of a dancer possessing poison. During the battle she poisons Alexander but is killed before finishing him off. Sagibarzanes, also a member of the Pythagorean cult frames Parmenion and Philotas for treason. Parmenion is killed and Philotas is tied up and stoned to death. While Alexander arrives during the stoning Philotas requests he let him die so as to not show weakness to the Persians. Phillipas, who treats Alexander has the opportunity to poison Alexander but instead reveals the truth to him, provides Alexander the means to heal himself, then poisons himself with the poison intended for Alexander. After executing Sagibarzanes and the other Persian traitors, Alexander leads his forces towards India. Aristotle provides Cassandra with a parchment that she is instructed to read when they reach India. They reach India where they see a large number of horse-like men known as the Brahman priests. Cleitus, becoming increasingly suspicious of Alexander questions his motives however the Brahman attack. Alexander and Cleitus are able to finish them off. Cassandra reads the parchment, which puts her under a spell from Aristotle to kill Alexander. When she lunges towards him however, Cleitus steps in the way and takes the fatal stab himself. Alexander and the others continue through India where they encounter a massive army made up of all the soldiers they have killed over the years. During the battle Haphestian is killed when Alexander fights the ghost of Darius. Alexander takes on King Porus, who takes on his own appearance, then encounters Pythagoras at the end of the world. Alexander embraces his destiny as destroyer of the world and yet the world survives. After their return to Macedonia we learn that Aristotle can no longer even remember who Cassandra was. Later Alexander is asked to get out of the light by a child drawing geometric shapes and writing formulas on the ground. After being told Roxanne is pregnant with his child, foiling Ptolemy\'s assassination attempt , and planning a new conquest in Arabia, Alexander looks at the child\'s work and is asked what he is looking at. Alexander replies, "The creation of the world. I am looking at the scene where the world I destroyed is created anew." At the very end we learn that the child\'s name is Euclid and he pulls out a small version of the platohedron showing that the destruction of the world was metaphysical in nature and that the new world of Euclid and Ptolemy I Soter has replaced the old world of Aristotle and Plato.'] ['Confined to a neck brace, poor little rich boy Dickie would like to play with the neighborhood kids, but his overprotective mother will not let him.

One of the rock particles that swirls away begins to increase in velocity as it moves up against the atmosphere of a Saturnian moon, becoming a meteorite that destroys a small lamp spire outside the starship Axiom. A repair robot named BURN-E is dispatched by SUPPLY-R, a storage robot that dispenses spare lamps, to replace the broken lamp. Before he can secure the new lamp, EVE\'s ship enters the Axiom{{\'}}s docking bay. Still hanging on the side of the ship, WALL-E waves to and distracts BURN-E while the loose lamp floats off into space. BURN-E retrieves another spare from SUPPLY-R, who is reluctant to let it go, and begins welding it down around the same time WALL-E is launched in an escape pod set to self-destruct in the original film.

Later as they are driving out to the mountains in their red woodie station wagon, Goofy tells his son about his past adventures. Each story is taken from previous Goofy short films. These include Californy er Bust, Tiger Trouble, and African Diary .

At last they rid themselves of the lion long enough to break camp. As they are speeding away in the car, Goofy asks his son "Did I ever tell you about the time I was a race car driver?"'] ['Donald is fast asleep in his bed.

Shortly after his arrival at college he becomes absorbed in the mysteries of life and death to the extent of forgetting practically everything else. His great ambition is to create a human being, and finally one night his dream is realized. He is convinced that he has found a way to create a most perfect human being that the world has ever seen. We see his experiment commence and the development of it in a vat of chemicals from a skeletal being. To Frankenstein's horror, instead of creating a marvel of physical beauty and grace, there is unfolded before his eyes and before the audience an awful, ghastly, abhorrent monster. As he realizes what he has done Frankenstein rushes from the room as the monster moves through the doors Frankenstein has placed before the vat. The misshapen monster peers at Frankenstein through the curtains of his bed. He falls fainting to the floor, where he is found by his servant, who revives him.  After a few weeks' illness, he returns home, a broken, weary man, but under the loving care of father and sweetheart he regains his health and strength and begins to take a less morbid view of life. The film's story emphasizes that the creation of the monster was possible only because Frankenstein had allowed his normal mind to be overcome by evil and unnatural thoughts. His marriage is soon to take place. But one evening, while sitting in his library, he chances to glance in the mirror before him and sees the reflection of the monster which has just opened the door of his room. All the terror of the past comes over him and, fearing lest his sweetheart should learn the truth, he bids the monster conceal himself behind the curtain while he hurriedly induces his sweetheart, who then comes in, to stay only a moment. The monster, who is following his creator with the devotion of a dog, is insanely jealous of anyone else. He snatches from Frankenstein's coat the rose which his sweetheart has given him, and in the struggle throws Frankenstein to the floor, here the monster looks up and for the first time confronts his own reflection in the mirror. Appalled and horrified at his own image he flees in terror from the room. Not being able, however to live apart from his creator, he again comes to the house on the wedding night and, searching for the cause of his jealousy, goes into the bride's room. Frankenstein coming into the main room hears a shriek of terror, which is followed a moment after by his bride rushing in and falling in a faint at his feet. The monster then enters and after overpowering Frankenstein's feeble efforts by a slight exercise of his gigantic strength leaves the house.  When Frankenstein's love for his bride shall have attained full strength and freedom from impurity it will have such an effect upon his mind that the monster cannot exist. The monster, broken down by his unsuccessful attempts to be with his creator, enters the room, stands before a large mirror and holds out his arms entreatingly. Gradually, the real monster fades away, leaving only the image in the mirror. A moment later Frankenstein himself enters. As he stands directly before the mirror he sees the image of the monster reflected instead of his own. Gradually, however, under the effect of love and his better nature, the monster's image fades and Frankenstein sees himself in his young manhood in the mirror. His bride joins him, and the film ends with their embrace, Frankenstein's mind now being relieved of the awful horror and weight it has been laboring under for so long."] ['A German secret document is stolen and Usmarte , the actual thief, lures Bugs Bunny into taking it.

Larry the Cucumber, thinking this is the very first "VeggieTales workout video", begins a jumping workout in time to generic, upbeat workout music, then proceeds to trampoline exercises. However, after jumping progressively higher, he hits his head on the cupboards... again and again. Bob then comes on-screen and explains that this is actually the very first "VeggieTales sing-along tape". To demonstrate, Bob has the French Peas type some lyrics on Qwerty, making the words appear at the bottom of the screen so people can sing along at home. However, they don\'t stop even after Bob stops singing, and the scene degenerates into true chaos as Bob yells "Roll tape!". After several songs, Larry, yet again misunderstanding the point of the sing-along, introduces the kids to the very first "VeggieTales home improvement video". Larry announces his plan to replace a leaky fixture on the sink with a new one "which will be quite attractive, and last for years to come."

However, when one of the French Peas tells him that they\'re not supposed to sing it, Bob clarifies by calling it "The New and Improved Bunny Song", in which the original lyrics and their negative implications have been  replaced with more positive messages. Larry then introduces his home-viewers to the very first "VeggieTales financial success video".

When Larry makes purely random statements of what he has never done, Pa Grape and Mr. Lunt berate him and say he should sing about "pirate-ty things." When Pa Grape asks Mr. Lunt for his opinion on whether Larry is making no sense, Mr. Lunt says Pa Grape looks like Cap\'n Crunch. After they gainsay each other and Pa Grape sentences Mr. Lunt to walk the plank, Larry sings another verse of nonsense. Pa Grape declares Larry does not understand what they said previously about his singing; they finish the song with the refrain "And we\'ve never been to Boston in the fall." They decide to watch Hiraldo, and Larry finds a quarter.'] ['Granny has taken Tweety to the beach for the day. Granny tells Tweety she can\'t wait to try on her new "bikini bathing suit" and promises to return right away. Meanwhile, Sylvester is fishing on the pier and, after pointing a gun at a worm, is immediately swallowed by a huge fish. After expressing his disgust about his lack of success, the cat spots Tweety in his cage, sitting on a rock across the pier and unguarded. Sylvester thinks he\'s in for a free meal ... until the tide comes in and washes Sylvester away. The high waters surround Tweety\'s cage, leaving the bird to yell for help. Sylvester then devises a variety of tricks to stay dry and ferry himself across the flooded beach to get at his meal: * Lowering himself toward the bird\'s cage by tying his fishing line around his chest; however, the line comes out of the reel, sending the cat into the river. * Driving a motorboat to the perch, but failing to notice the boat is still tied to the dock. * Powering himself with an outboard motor and a pair of waterskis. However, he crashes into the rock. * Inflating a pair of balloons to use as water wings; he is immediately surrounded by five hungry sharks, who bite at the cat. Sylvester gets away, de-furred to the point where it appears he\'s wearing a Tarzan-like loincloth. After doing Tarzan\'s trademark chest-beating and howl, he collapses on the sandbar. Eventually, Granny  sees the flooded beach and Sylvster attempting to get at Tweety. Unaware of Sylvester\'s true motives, Granny believes the cat is attempting to rescue the bird and—in a change of her usual attitude toward him—offers to help Sylvester. At one point, both are washed away when the tide comes in again; this happens after Sylvester gets knocked silly after hitting his head against the dock, and Granny tries to help him come to by splashing water on him . Later, Granny gives Sylvester a diving suit and keeps watch over the air pressure. Just then, a frustrated Tweety realizes that the only way he\'ll be rescued is if he rows his cage ashore himself ... which he does successfully. Granny sees Tweety come ashore and joyously runs to reunite with her beloved canary. She then forgets about the "heroic pussycat," who in Granny\'s diverted attention has allowed the air pressure machine to shut off, leaving Sylvester without any oxygen. Granny overcompensates by hastily pumping the machine, dangerously over-inflating the suit. Sylvester manages to free himself, just as Granny is talking with Tweety about her appreciation of the cat\'s rescue efforts; she tells the bird, "He certainly deserves a just reward!" Which Sylvester does, but a very nasty one: a safe landing in the city dog pound!'] ['Betty receives an invitation to a party from her elderly relative, Grampy.

A diplomatic dinner is held in Moscow to celebrate the operation, at which President of the United States James Marshall  expresses his remorse that action had not been taken sooner to prevent the suffering that Radek caused and vows that the his administration will take a firmer stance against despotism and refuse to negotiate with terrorists. President Marshall, along with his wife Grace , his daughter Alice , and several of his Cabinet and advisers board Air Force One to return to the United States. A contingent of news reporters are also aboard. U.S. Secret Service agent Gibbs , acting as a mole for a group of six Soviet ultranationalist terrorists led by Ivan Korshunov , sneaks them onto the plane disguised as a Russian news crew. Once in flight, Gibbs kills several secret service agents guarding the plane\'s armory, allowing Korshunov and his men to take the armory\'s weapons and equipment and seize control of the plane. The pilots attempt to land the plane at Ramstein Air Base in Germany, but are killed and the terrorists\' pilot takes control, diverting the plane towards Kazakhstan. U.S. Secret Service agents take Marshall to an escape pod in the cargo hold, while the rest of the passengers are taken hostage. Believing the President has escaped, the hijackers separate his wife and daughter from the rest of their hostages, planning to use them as leverage. At the White House Situation Room, Korshunov contacts Vice President of the United States Kathryn Bennett  threatening to kill a hostage every half hour until Radek is released. Meanwhile, the U.S. military locates the escape pod but finds it empty. Unbeknownst to the hijackers, President Marshall, a retired military aviator, veteran of the Vietnam War, and Medal of Honor recipient, stayed aboard the plane. He contacts the White House via satellite phone, and reminds Bennett not to negotiate with the terrorists. Marshall manages to overwhelm the men guarding the hostages and develops a plan to drain the fuel from the plane, forcing the hijackers to request mid-air refueling, which would drop the plane to a low enough altitude to allow the hostages to parachute out. Though his advisers insist Marshall leave, he refuses to go without his family. When Korshunov discovers the deception, he forces the plane away, causing the fuel to ignite and destroy the fueling plane, he then captures Marshall and a few of his advisors before they can escape. With Marshall and his family held hostage, Bennett is forced to contact Russian President Petrov to issue Radek\'s release. Korshunov and his men celebrate as the event is broadcast over the plane\'s speakers, but Marshall uses the distraction to free himself. While Marshall\'s advisers deal with the remaining terrorists, Korshunov grabs Grace and disappears to the plane\'s parachute ramp, followed by Marshall. Grace manages to get away, and Marshall wrestles with Korshunov, eventually forcing his chute, wrapped around Korshunov\'s neck, to open, pulling him out of the plane and killing him. Marshall races back to the communication room to announce his freedom just as Radek is about to board a waiting helicopter. When the prison guards attempt to recapture him, Radek tries to flee but is shot and killed. Marshall directs Air Force One back towards friendly airspace, but they are soon followed by Kazakh MiG-29s piloted by Radek loyalists. Escorting U.S. F-15s fend off the attack, including one pilot that sacrifices himself to intercept a missile, but the shrapnel from the explosion destroys Air Force One\'s tail controls, sending the plane towards the Caspian Sea. A nearby patrolling U.S. Air Force Special Operations Command MC-130E Combat Talon is called in to rescue Marshall and the others via zip-line; Marshall insists his family and advisers are rescued first. Gibbs, who had remained on the plane, reveals his betrayal and kills Major Caldwell, and attempts to save himself on the last zip-line crossing before Air Force One strikes the water. Marshall overpowers him, and grabs and detaches the zip line moments before the plane explosively disintegrates on hitting the water. The MC-130E crew reel in the President, and change their call sign to "Air Force One" as they head back towards friendly airspace, while Marshall is reunited with his family.'] ["It is the old west and the Dillon clan are making life miserable for a small Western town.

Coyote  assuming the "on your mark" stance used in track and field events. As soon as he goes into "get set" mode, he hears the familiar beeping sound and gets shocked into a backward move, suspended in mid-air atop a ravine. The Road Runner  issues the gunshot that causes the Coyote to drop . The credits then show in the dust. The Coyote walks away and soon comes up with a plan. 1. The Coyote first puts out his foot in the road to trip the Road Runner, only to get his foot flattened by a truck. He ends up having to limp off the screen. 2. The Coyote then tries to use a bow and arrow to try and spear the Road Runner. This is unsuccessful; instead of launching the arrow, the bow hits the Coyote, who falls off the edge of the cliff. The wood then grabs onto a ledge, therefore slinging the Coyote back up. Now it\'s the string that\'s on the ledge, while the wood is on Wile E.\'s head. Wile E grabs the cliff from which he fell; at that very moment the string breaks a piece off the ledge, which shoots back up towards the Coyote. He is squashed, and a piece of the cliff he was hanging onto breaks off and falls with the Coyote and the other rock. The Coyote awakens and finds that the cliff segment is over him. He pushes the rock away and almost loses his balance, but gets back on the rock. He pants with relief, but then he lands on one end of a rock see-saw. The other rock lands on the other side, catapulting the Coyote back to the cliff, where he ricochets off it and ends up catapulting the other rock and then squash himself. 3. Then, the Coyote plans to drop the Road Runner in a manhole. When he hears the "beep-beep" of his opponent, he pulls the rope supporting the manhole cover. Just before falling into the manhole, the Road Runner picks up the manhole and takes it away. Furious, the Coyote chases after the Road Runner, but then the manhole cover falls on his head. He continues the chase, which ends when the Road Runner puts the manhole on a suspension bridge, which results in the Coyote falling in a hole in the bridge. 4. The Coyote now uses a Batman-like outfit attached to a rocket, but instead of launching the Coyote, the rocket explodes, sending a charred Wile E. falling. 5. Wile E. now uses Acme iron bird seed to attract the Road Runner. The Road Runner munches it all up and zooms off. Now the Coyote uses roller skates and a magnet to catch up with the Road Runner. They then chase until the Road Runner moves onto a railroad track, so Wile E. can be attracted to another magnetic material: an approaching train! 6. The Coyote then uses a springy block of pavement to try and trap the Road Runner in midair. However, the Road Runner stops short before the pavement springs up. This time, it springs up a little too hard; it does a 180 and ends up on top of the Coyote. 7. Now, Wile E. uses two machine guns attached to the same rope, but the Road Runner breaks the rope instead of pulling it. The Coyote, confused, tries to tie the rope back together, but then gets shot repeatedly and reduced down to size. 8. Finally, Wile E. buys a rocket sled and 30 miles of railroad track. Instead of going forward, however, the sled shoots up, past many stars and satellites, until the rocket sled explodes, forming a Sagittarius-like constellation of Wile E Coyote.'] ['{{Plot}} A mouse named Jinx is trying to run a cat named Jasper is holding Jinx\'s tail so that he cannot move. Jasper almost has Jinx run into his mouth, but Jinx stops in time and runs toward his mousehole. Jasper catches him with his tail and tosses the mouse into the air; he lands on the cat\'s tail, then runs down his body until he has to keep himself from being eaten again. Jinx dashes off and Jasper waltzes behind him innocently, hops in front of the door and opens his mouth. Jinx runs in this time, but then rolls out of the cat\'s mouth on his tongue. After some chasing, Jasper runs around a back pathway and makes a new mousehole on the wall by dipping his finger in magic ink, complete with a sign that says "HOME SWEET HOME". Jinx stops running in order to enter his hole and an invisible block knocks him out. The cat revives the poor mouse with a dash of water. Jinx recovers and soon notices that something is next to him, feels the cat\'s head and grabs an eyelid; promptly, Jasper opens his eye and hoists him up. Jinx looks at the cat and realizes who it is, gulps, and punches Jasper in the eye; Jasper shrieks in pain and retaliates by giving chase, but shortly runs into a houseplant and breaks it. His owner, Mammy Two Shoes, a black woman, quickly arrives and chastises Jasper. Jasper tiptoes away, but is soon under Mammy\'s broom, who comments about Jasper\'s mess. As Jasper pulls the broom off his face, he sees the mess; the housemaid delivers one last threat that forms the basis for the cartoon. If Jasper breaks one more thing, Mammy will throw him out for good. Mammy pushes the cat away with her broom in punctuation. Jasper creeps away, but soon runs into a table, knocking over a vase which he must catch; although he succeeds, he soon spots the mouse laughing at him. Jasper crawls over the floor malevolently, and Jinx gets out of the candlestick as Jasper runs up onto the table to catch him. He holds out a wineglass from the table and threatens to break it, which forces the cat into retreat. Meanwhile, he hears Mammy prancing around the house with the swept-up mess. Jasper gulps, chuckles nervously and walks off. The mouse nods in delight, but soon sees Jasper running after him once again and renews the threat. This time, Jinx whacks the cat with the glass, who once again hides away in fear. Tired of this, Jinx winks at the camera, throws the glass down and whistles to alert the cat, who dashes at the glass and narrowly saves it. Another whistle, another glass, the tray holding the glasses, and the four glasses that were on it follow; Jasper is lastly hit on the head with a decorated plate of flowers. Jasper sees Jinx taunting him with one more glass in his hand; frustrated, Jasper attempts to throw the plate to the ground, but realizes this would probably break it and hits himself over the head. The cat then spots pillows of all sorts on a nearby couch and lays them out, determined to end this threat. As Jinx marches along the table, Jasper pops his head up next to him and is unmoved by Jinx\'s threat. The mouse then twists his tail at the cat as if to say "Have it your way", and arrogantly throws the glass to the floor. Not hearing the crash he expected, he looks down to the ground and sees that the glass fell on one of the pillows, punctuated by a smug grin from the cat. Jinx\'s tail is promptly trapped by the cat; the mouse says a quick prayer, and after some quick thought adds "Amen". Jasper then lets him go, only to catch and toss him with his tail again, then sits with mouth open for Jinx to fall into. Unfortunately, the mouse has landed on the china rack and drops a plate down onto Jasper instead of himself. Jasper is momentarily stunned but still catches the plate, but Jinx proceeds to knock over every plate on the rack and force the cat to lug around the stack of plates. Sweating uncontrollably, Jasper finally manages to lean the stack against the wall, but he soon spots the mouse waving at him from the top of the stack. Jasper can only watch in terror as the mouse throws the last plate down to its inevitable destruction. Mammy angrily storms down the steps, proclaiming that she will evict the cat as soon as she gets down. Jinx leaps in triumph, then runs down the stack of plates, stomps on Jasper\'s nose, rolls his eyelids, squirts his milk into the cat\'s back, and even cleans himself with Jasper\'s tail; by now, Mammy is approaching with broom in hand and Jinx gets down to business by kicking the cat in the rear, which causes him to drop all the crockery and be punished unfairly by Mammy. Jinx flees the scene and dives into his hole just before Mammy squashes him underfoot. An angry Mammy drags Jasper across the floor and throws him out of the house. The triumphant Jinx watches his opponent get thrown out, and then spots the "Home Sweet Home" sign used to trick him earlier. The mouse posts the sign by his own mousehole and nods in confidence that this is his own one as he marches in.'] [" The Stooges, while running the Cafe Casbah Bah  and attempting to prepare a meal for customers Hassan Ben Sober  and Ginna Rumma , discover a plan that their hungry customers are hatching.

The narration begins, informing us that that victory was won by a team where everyone knew the job they had to do: "We\'re playing another kind of a game now, only this one isn\'t for fun. It\'s for keeps." the narrator declares, with shots of a tank battle now on screen. British life and society are briefly introduced. The narrator notes especially the high population density of Britain and the solidarity that this inspires between various elements of its society. :Here\'s where he lives &ndash; a little island no larger than the state of Idaho. Half a million people live in Idaho. 96 times that number live in Britain. The Nazis and the Japs scream about Lebensraum &ndash; "living space" &ndash; but on a square mile of Britain there are more people than on a square mile of Germany or Italy or Japan. In 1938, the year the Yankees won the pennant, the British were going about their daily lives, working and cheering football on their day off. {{convert}} away, however, others were cheering for Hitler. The Brits try to reason with him through the Munich Agreement, but he breaks his word, invading Czechoslovakia and Poland. Now "John Britain," as he is personified, is at war, and pretty soon he is at war alone, since western Europe soon falls to the Nazis. Various differences in British and American culture are addressed, sometimes humorously, other more soberly, such as the position of the monarchy and the peers in British society. "Britain is like your Grandma\'s house; she\'s been around a long time and keeps a lot of old things she doesn\'t wish to part with." The British Empire is a trickier subject, with the narrator explaining the home-rule of Canada, South Africa and the other white dominions, then giving a rosy picture of how much self-government India has, and how, because of its strategic significance &ndash; "an effective block by the democratic world to keep the Nazis and Japs from uniting" &ndash; it cannot be independent just yet.'] ['A group of schoolchildren from London are preparing for evacuation.

Through the basement window, Tom reaches for one of the bottles and then snatches it, rushing into the living room to pour it in his bowl and drink it but Jerry also wants Tom\'s milk. Tom makes various attempts to catch Jerry but when they all fail, the cat dreams up a murderous plot to rid himself of his annoyance. The next scene shows Tom mixing chemicals such as moth balls, acid, and poison into his milk. When Tom stirs the deadly elixir with a spoon, the chemicals cause the spoon to dissolve. After seeing a fly taking a little sip from the bowl before crying in pain and then dropping dead, Tom becomes amazed about the effect, then carefully carries the bowl and places it outside Jerry\'s hole, confident that his potion works, gleefully watching Jerry about to drink from the bowl.  Seeing the bowl of milk once again, the mouse takes a couple licks, causing him to yell in pain and collapse "dead". Just before Tom can celebrate over the "dead" mouse, the full effects of the potion take place. Jerry stiffens angularly, and then rattles and pops around, in a manner reminiscent of the 1937 Mickey Mouse cartoon short The Worm Turns. Every muscle in Jerry\'s body quadruples in number, and he is 10 times more muscular. His muscles also becomes at least 1000 times harder then a diamond. Tom tries to smash the mouse with a phone book, but fails to even faze him; Jerry easily tears the book apart, and hitting him with the poker only leaves several mouse-shaped dents in it due to his diamond hard muscles. Tom panics and shuts the door to the living room, but Jerry\'s mega monster giant muscles shatter it just by walking into it. Now really scared, Tom seals himself inside a safe but Jerry\'s muscles easily drill through the door and pulls him out. Jerry\'s seemingly infinite strength allows him to smack Tom against the safe, but the potion\'s effects wear off and Jerry returns to his normal size. The potion\'s effects lasted for about a minute. After realizing he can no longer pull the cat around, he dives away from the cat and into the milk bowl where he takes a huge gulp. Tom grabs the mouse out of the bowl as he screams and Jerry\'s muscles grow far huger then last time. he now appears to be much more muscular, much stronger, and much harder muscles. He now grabs Tom and hurls him by his whiskers before the potion wears off. This lasted for about 10 seconds. As Jerry realizes he is normal again he simply ties Tom\'s whiskers and tries to drink more potion. The feline upends the bowl with his foot before the mouse can drink enough, and the chase continues across the kitchen. As Tom looks for the mouse, Jerry puts Tom\'s tail on a waffle iron and shuts it. The cat screams in pain and glares at his waffle-shaped tail as Jerry runs for the fridge. When Tom looks inside, Jerry boots him in and seals the door. With Tom temporarily detained inside the kitchen fridge, Jerry hurriedly attempts to make lots and lots more of the concoction himself to make him even huger, albeit with an inaccurate formula. But before Jerry has a chance to drink it, Tom escapes from the fridge and steals the milk from Jerry. The mouse tries to run away, but Tom stomps on his tail and forces his enemy to watch as he drinks the entire concoction. The cat grins evilly at Jerry. Tom begins to grow bigger and bigger, and at first it appears Jerry\'s done for. But then an explosion erupts from Tom, resulting him shrinking to a smaller size than Jerry. This lasted for about 3 seconds. Jerry snatches his tail from Tom\'s foot, grabs Tom\'s tail, and punches his face. This triggers the cat to shrink further, and Jerry snaps Tom\'s tail. Tom then shrinks down to the size of a fly, and Jerry starts to chase Mini-Tom with a flyswatter.'] ['A man  embarks on an unspecified mission to infiltrate an old, decaying, abandoned house that rests in a lonely Czech countryside.

Richard Garriott is billed as 'The Gunfight Participant' – a satirical nod to his official status as a 'Spaceflight Participant.' These six were all the crew aboard the International Space Station during Garriott's time aboard. After this preview, the film proper begins. A series of motion graphics under the credits leads us to a Soyuz spacecraft departing the International Space Station, bearing Garriott, Volkov, and Kononenko back to earth. Finke and Chamitoff wave goodbye but express their relief at Garriott's leaving as he was annoying them with his constant talk of computer games. Lonchakov insists that they all go back to work. One week later, Chamitoff and Fincke are both missing Garriott. Chamitoff could no longer juggle without Garriott, and Fincke knew Garriott was good at settling arguments about which of them was standing upside down. At this point Lonchakov points out that the oxygen use aboard the station is too high. Everyone theorizes wildly about the cause which universally involve interstellar aliens invading the station. A search of ridiculous locations on the station ensues during which the surprising nature of the alien is discovered. The completed film is just over eight minutes in length.

Still, Jerry has to scramble in thin air to hold on for dear life. Tom again tries to sneak away quietly, and succeeds until the floor creaks causing Spike to go after him again. Off-screen, sounds of a horrific brawl are heard, and the mortified mouse resolves to assist his rival in fighting the greater danger. The cat jumps onto a desk as the dog attempts to bite him, and Jerry whistles for Tom to join him on top of the clock where it's safe. To avoid the next chomp, Tom leaps all the way to the clock, but his grip is unstable and Tom's whiskers start snapping under the tension. As he starts to fall, the cat gropes in thin air to safety, and Tom extends his hand to Jerry in gratitude. When Jerry loses balance trying to shake the cat's hand, Tom returns the favor by lowering his tail to pull him out of Spike's mouth, and with this alliance fully sealed, they shake hands.  The new allies connive a plan together; Jerry sneaks across the ceiling sides, down a curtain, and into a sewing basket. He ties a piece of the long thread of yarn to his body and starts to sneak through the house. As a cover for Jerry's plan, Tom taunts the dog and holds out his tail, continually pulling it up every time Spike tries to bite it. Meanwhile, the mouse has woven the entirety of the yarn through the house as a trap for Spike. As the dog pants angrily, Jerry pulls up behind and kicks him in the rear, causing the dog to scream in pain. When the dog lands, he sticks out his tongue and throws the dog's lips over his own face, provoking Spike to chase him around the corner. The mouse then hides and leaves Spike to fall into the yarn trap, completely wrecking the room. Mammy Two Shoes promptly enters and surveys the scene and Spike is dragged across the floor by Mammy and thrown out of the house, as he is not her dog. Tom and Jerry wave to Spike as they watch him get thrown out, and Tom breathes a sigh of relief until a snap is heard behind the curtain they are hiding. Tom's tail has gotten caught in another mousetrap, and despite Jerry's mournful denial, the chase resumes."] ['An evil witch called Khira transforms a couple of princes, Jamil and Jamila, into two white mice.

Disguising themselves as southern officers and taking the names Lieutenant Duck, Captain Dodge and Major Hyde, they insinuate themselves into the mansion of southern officer, Colonel Butts . During preparations for a dinner party at the mansion, Curly, more interested in the Colonel\'s daughter, Miss Judith Butts , manages to substitute a cake with a quilted potholder, resulting in a feather-coughing scene.

The tycoon says: "Stop the car Maverick! There\'s a hole on my property that aint a gushing oil!" On the back door of the limousine, a crest is shown which carries the legend, "Orvil Rich—Texan". Once Maverick stops the car, pulls a motor scooter out from behind the driver\'s seat  and rides the scooter back to the tycoon\'s back door. The tycoon surveys the situation and builds a derrick over top of the hole. Bugs comes up and asks "What\'s up doc?" The tycoon explains and tells Bugs to "git". Bugs tells the tycoon that the hole is, in fact, his home and tells the tycoon to drill someplace else. The tycoon tries to evict Bugs, which gets Bugs\' dander up. He sends down a box of dynamite and Bugs gives the tycoon a birthday cake with the dynamite sticks for candles.

Bugs lifts the hat to show it\'s him. The tycoon calls for Maverick, who\'s still in Bugs\' hole. The tycoon, ignorant of the situation, calls up the hole for Maverick to lower some dynamite. Bugs sends down as much as possible, at the demands of the tycoon who says: "I\'ll blow the critter to the outskirts of Dallas!" The hole is so loaded with dynamite when the tycoon, who is in the hole, can\'t see his hand before his face. Bugs calls down and tells the tycoon to look in his left hand dresser drawer for his "cigareet" lighter, which the tycoon uses while still in the hole. After the explosion, instead of oil, a gusher of carrots comes out of the hole and Bugs exclaims: "Hey! Looks like I brought in a carrot gusher!". After chomping on one of them, he senses some of the audience\'s slight disbelief at what they\'re seeing, adding: "Yeah, I know, I know...but anything can happen in \'Te-ay-xus\'!" which closes the cartoon.'] ["In the film, the Gilgamesh is a grotesque, Picasso-esque being who moves by tricycle and patrols his box shaped kingdom that hovers above a dark abyss. The yellow walls are inscribed with calligraphic text and its seemingly vast expanse is randomly broken up by square holes from which medical hooks occasionally project. A table – a mechanism and a trap – concealing a pulsating vagina within one of its drawers, stands at the centre of Gilgamesh’s domain. High above this space are strung high-tension wires, vibrating in the wind, one caught with a broken tennis racquet. First, Gilgamesh is seen setting up a bizarre trap to lure and catch the wild man Enkidu . Enkidu appears to live in a distant forest world visible through a hatch in the side of one of the walls of the floating kingdom. Gilgamesh is seen eating dandelion fluff during the opening credits before he finishes readying the trap. Once finished, Gilgamesh retreats to a room beneath the floor of the floating kingdom, awaiting Enkidu's arrival. Sometime later, Enkidu enters and becomes intrigued by a table with an anatomical, H.R. Giger/da Vinci-esque image of a woman's muscles . The mechanism activates allowing Enkidu to look inside the image revealing a swaying piece of meat on a hook within the woman’s body. A drawer on the table opens, revealing the pulsating vagina. Ecstatic, Enkidu begins to mount the table, which sets off Gilgamesh's trap, flinging him onto the high-tension wires. An excited Gilgamesh resurfaces, retrieving the ensnared Enkidu by means of a giant gold cloth. Gilgamesh binds his captive with twine, beats him with a spiked club, and brushes his wings before cutting them off with scissors. Gilgamesh cuts the twine binding Enkidu and as the gold cloth falls to the ground the viewer is given a shot of Enkidu’s forest. The same fluff that Gilgamesh was eating earlier litters the forest floor and the viewer is allowed to observe an insect husk rapidly decay. In the end, Gilgamesh is seen riding frenzied circles around Enkidu, who is now trapped beneath the table-mechanism on which the trap was set.http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/720892/index.html"] ['Daffy goes to the beach with his girlfriend Melissa , and wants to take her picture.

However, Professor Hinkle's rabbit, Hocus Pocus, escapes from the building while wearing his owner's top hat, which the children decide to put on top of Frosty's head, and the magic from the hat successfully brings Frosty to life. This delights the students, but after seeing that the hat is actually magic, the agitated Hinkle wants it back, which the children refuse to provide him with. Antagonized by both the children's dislike of his magic performance and the fact that he may not be given his top hat back, Professor Hinkle makes it his main priority to snatch the hat back from Frosty. The children and their snowman gleefully parade through town, shocking passersby with Frosty's anthropomorphism, and they are very happy with him, but the temperature is rising and Frosty must leave for somewhere that is colder or else he will melt. Karen, a little girl who is especially attached to Frosty, suggests that the group bring him to the North Pole, but they are barred from boarding a train that will take him there due to their lack of tickets. So, Karen and Frosty sneak into the back of a train delivering frozen goods, but Hinkle has also secretly managed to hitch a ride on the train as well in hopes of stealing back his hat, but falls off and is knocked cold. Needing to put as much distance between themselves and Hinkle as possible, they continue on toward the North Pole, accompanied by Hocus, who has chosen to side with them rather than Hinkle. While Frosty is safe from melting, Karen on the other hand is freezing and Hocus gathers with a group of woodland creatures to build a fire for her. Frosty knows that it is best if Karen is brought home, and he and Hocus decide to enlist the help of Santa Claus to transport her there. Hocus leaves to search for Santa while Frosty decides to take Karen to a greenhouse for warmth, but Hinkle has since come to and wants the hat back. He blows out Karen's fire and starts to pick a fight with Frosty who dodges and weaves. Being too slow for Hinkle, Frosty sees no other choice but to put Karen on his back and do a belly flop down to the bottom of the hill where a greenhouse lies. Following Karen in to make sure she is safe proves to be a lethal move for Frosty however. Hinkle has followed them on foot down the hill back to the greenhouse, and huffing and puffing, slams the door on the twosome, locking them inside, saying `As soon as Frosty melts, the hat will be mine!' In the meantime, Hocus manages to bring Santa back to the greenhouse to return Karen home. But when they return to the greenhouse for Frosty and Karen, they find her sobbing over a puddle of water with Frosty's top hat lying nearby. To console Karen, Santa tells her that Frosty was made of Christmas snow and can never melt away and will be back just as before, as soon as a crisp December wind kisses it. But Karen is still inconsolable, so to prove his point, Santa opens the door and a cold, strong gale blows through the greenhouse, revives Frosty. Karen is just about to put his hat on when Hinkle still declares that it's his and he wants it back. Santa on the other hand threatens to never deliver another present in all his life if he dares to harm Frosty in any way. Santa tells Hinkle that even if he wants a CHANCE for a Christmas present this year, as an act of penance, he must write a hundred zillion times, promising to never try to hurt the snowman again. Then Santa tells Hinkle that he'll find a new hat in his stocking on Christmas morning. Now joyful, Hinkle runs off to fulfill this order. Soon after, Santa takes Karen on a sleigh ride home and brings Frosty back to the North Pole, keeping his promise that he'll be back again someday."] ['The film begins with a pack of wolves howling in the center of Hollywood .

A rotoscoped hand holds a microphone near the worm. The worm launches into the fast-talking patter of a tobacco auctioneer, ending with "Sold to an American!"  and expectorates the chewed tobacco into an off-screen spittoon. * A map showing Florida and Cuba also traces the path of a cruise vessel. It takes a straight line from the Gulf Coast to Havana for a stop at Sloppy Joe\'s bar . It then takes a meandering series of aimless spirals, while "How Dry I Am" plays in the underscore. * Now sailing along the ocean, the narrator points out the use of camouflage for a warship called the S.S. Yehudi (referencing one of [[Jerry Colonna , which is invisible except for its crew, flags and the smoke billowing from its chimney. * Now soaring over the Alps, a "low flying" airplane is seen skimming up and down the mountainsides like a skier. * Still in the Alps, a comic triple shows a St. Bernard dog with a small keg of Scotch around its neck, followed by another St. Bernard with a keg of soda, and finally a St. Bernard pup carrying a smaller keg, containing "Bromo". * An agile mountain goat springs from peak to peak, finally diving over a cliff and out of frame to a funny sound effect. * In the "Sahara Desert", a number of pyramids appear, the narrator talking of how ancient they are - including stone renditions of the Trylon and Perisphere, which originally appeared at the 1939 New York World\'s Fair. * The Sphinx is seen next, with the narrator describing how the stone figure just sits there, century after century. The Sphinx  then speaks to the camera, doing another Jerry Colonna schtick: "Monotonous... isn\'t it?" * An oil well somewhere in Europe is about to yield a "gusher" for an axis of the United States. After some rumbling and pressure buildup, the well erupts - emitting just one large drop of oil, which lands in a spittoon . * Deep in the jungle, an insect-eating plant  is about to consume a "poor little" bumblebee. The plant chomps down on the bee, which then buzzes furiously inside the plant\'s mouth. In yet another spit joke, the plant finally expectorates the bee with a loud  "OUCH!" and the bee walks away smugly. * A group of African animals is lined up at a "water hole", which turns out to be a functional drinking fountain, with an adult zebra holding a young zebra up to it. * Flying over an African landscape, the narrator describes the features, reporting their possibly-nonsense names, leading up to a female-shaped body of water called Veronica Lake, suggesting the age of that joke that was later recycled frequently by Rocky and Bullwinkle. * A pair of caucasian safari hunters, dressed in white, led by a typical stereotyped pygmy guide, are in search of giant cannibals. The trio disappears behind some trees. After a silent pause, a loud clatter is heard. The pygmy runs out from behind the trees and  shouts excitedly to the camera, in a mixture of pseudo African double-talk and the words of the "The Hut-Sut Song". Pan to the left and the giant cannibals are holding the seemingly tiny  white men, who resemble rolled up cigarettes. The cannibal holding the taller of the two men remarks, "King-Size!" * Three cute little grey-and-white rabbits are playing in the jungle. The narrator\'s voice turns from softness to shouting panic as a vulture appears in the sky. The fearsome-looking bird, with a Japanese stereotyped face and Japanese flags on its wings, dives toward the bunnies. They run behind some weeds, which fall away revealing an anti-aircraft gun and the rabbits wearing Civil Defense white helmets. They fire loud volleys at the bird, which is blown away . The rabbit that had its back to the audience turns and is revealed to be a grinning Bugs Bunny , who faces the audience, gives the thumbs up sign with both hands, and says, "Eh, t\'umbs up, Doc! T\'umbs up!" At iris-out, only Bugsy\'s ears are still on-screen, which spring into a "V for Victory" sign, as "We Did It Before" plays in the underscore.'] ["In Part 1, a foreign Intelligence agency chief Shtampf is suffering from a toothache.

SpongeBob runs off a cliff and falls into a truck of mud, then into a truck of feathers. Back home, having given up on his dream, SpongeBob dries himself out when he receives an insulting phone call and puts the hair dryer in his pants. While he talks, the hair dryer inflates his pants, giving him the ability to fly. He goes around helping people, earning their admiration and becoming a superhero of sorts.

However, the octopus meat is cursed, causing the person who eats it to only be able to speak takogo .

The play  is written like a Shakespearean play, using words of older English and creating silly  expressions like "What ho!" The play is written, produced, and directed by Mrs. Funston Evergreen Kennedy. Her husband, Officer Kennedy, is responsible for the special effects and is forced to play different characters, including the giant named Ursus and an elephant. As a nervous, uptight Mrs. Kennedy gives her introduction to the audience, the kids get ready for their performance. Their disgust and lack of enthusiasm show how they feel about the show. During the first act, Mary Ann  and Wheezer forget a good bit of their lines and confuse some of the words for others, so Mrs. Kennedy has to yell them out to them. In the background, a tall boy who plays Ursus sneezes, causing his fake wig and beard to fall and land on Pete the Pup. Mrs. Kennedy helps Chubby start with his line and then excitedly forces her husband to shake the tin to create thundering noises. When Farina  begins saying his line, a goat runs loose and butts him, knocking him down. Getting up, Farina yells, "Forsooth, I think these mountains are full of too many goats!" At the end of Act I, Chubby gets ready to play Nero. He looks at the script and begins writing his lines on his costume in case he forgets a line. Mr. Kennedy luckily notices that he was wearing his costume inside out and has him put it on correctly. At the beginning of Act II, Jackie delivers his lines and  forgets several words, so Mrs. Kennedy yells them to him, getting more and more nervous. Donald Haines catches the giggles while saying his line about Nero riding an "elephant bathed in perfume." Just minutes later after Kennedy comes onstage in an elephant costume , the curtain accidentally falls in the middle of he scene, causing the elephant head to fall off. The boy in charge of opening and closing the curtains just sits, so Mrs. Kennedy has to open them up for him. Chubby accidentally falls on a bowl of tomatoes, and the juice leaves his rear end wet and dirty. Meanwhile, some teenaged boys  are seeking revenge by throwing eggs at the players. Chubby forgets a line and has to pull his toga up to find out what his next line is . His mother and Mrs. Kennedy order him to put it back down, so he asks quietly what he must say. After being given the line, he says, "What ho! Bring on the dancing girls!" A female dancer comes onstage to do her number while the musicians play a sour-note version of "The Blue Danube Waltz.". The angry boys find the dance number terrible and throw an egg at her face. As Farina does his scene, wherein he reads the future from a crystal ball, he confuses some words for others, so Mrs. Kennedy again has to yell out the right words. After a while, he gets disgusted and aggravated with her yelling, and he yells out for the audience to hear, "Doggone it! Look, I wish that woman would quit bothering me!" The audience chuckles, and Farina resumes his performance by beginning his next line with "Well, anyway..." Chubby suddenly gets an egg thrown in his face, while Farina gets one at his right ear. Mrs. Kennedy, who is on the verge of a nervous breakdown, begins biting at her script. At the beginning of Act III, "Mary Annicus" is told that Nero wants to marry her. Before she is able to show that she forgot her line, Mrs. Kennedy gives it to her: "I spurn thy vile heart, O monster, and cast it in the dust." Mary Ann, refusing to go through all that, just shortens the line: "Well anyway, I won\'t marry ya." Farina gets a second egg in the face, and the fight that he must have with the lion turns into a comedic act. The scenes with the sacred bull are even funnier when the man in the bull costume runs around and dances. Kennedy comes out onstage to play Ursus the Giant, who has to kill the "bullicus." When the man inside the bull costume provokes Kennedy by making the bull stand on just its hind legs, Kennedy takes off his beard and hair and fights the man inside the bull costume with his bare fists. By now, Mrs. Kennedy is about to break down and cry. Soon, Kennedy gets a pie in the face from one of the teenaged boys. While saying his line, Chubby ends up getting a pie thrown at him from one of the boys. His mother catches the boy in the act of throwing the pie and encourages Chubby to throw a pie back at the boy. Chubby tries but misses. The man who was hit tries to hit Chubby but ends up hitting one of the other boys, and the boy\'s father tries to hit that man but misses. Chubby tries to hit another person who hit him with a pie but ends up hitting his own mother. Soon, a pie fight begins with everyone in the auditorium participating. Mrs. Kennedy sees the play being completely ruined and orders everyone to stop. The kids turn to Kennedy. He nods, giving them permission, and all the kids throw their pies at her.'] ['The movie is the one-day story of a famous writer, touched with paralysis, whose faith cannot help him overcome his frustrations, and mostly the jealousy aroused by a woman too young and beautiful to be his wife.'] ['Mickey Mouse is hosting a radio talent show in front of a live audience. The film opens with Pete singing an ungraceful version of "Asleep in the Deep," but Mickey rings a gong signaling the end of the performance. Despite Pete\'s determination to finish the song, a pair of robotic hands remove him forcefully. Mickey then introduces the next act, Donald Duck. Donald first presents an apple to Mickey in an attempt to win him over prematurely. But Donald\'s act, a recitation of "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star", ends badly as he forgets the words. Mickey rings the gong and Donald is removed from stage. Just as Mickey is announcing the next act, a disgruntled Donald returns to take back the apple. The next act, as introduced by Mickey, are "the two Claras: Cluck and Belle." Clara Cluck sings a clucking version of the "Il Bacio" waltz by Luigi Arditi accompanied by Clarabelle Cow on piano. Although Clara struggles with the swinging microphone, the performance is the first to avoid being "gonged." After this Donald Duck returns to stage with a submachine gun and, holding Mickey and the audience at gunpoint, determines to complete "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star" again. But he again forgets the words, and when the audience laughs at him, he opens fire. The robotic hands grab Donald and takes him off stage in a hurry.Some released versions of the film omitted this scene which was determined too violent. The most recent release however is of the film in its original version. Mickey emerges from behind the podium and introduces the final act: Goofy and his "50-piece band" which turns out to be a multi-instrumental contraption/vehicle from which he can play many instruments at once. Goofy begins by playing "In the Good Old Summer Time," and then "There\'ll Be a Hot Time in the Old Town Tonight."  But the tempo and intensity of the song is too much for the machine which eventually self-desctructs. Goofy emerges from the wreckage and humorously admits "It busted!" But just then Donald Duck breaks out of Goofy\'s bandmaster hat and very quickly recites a word perfect recitation of "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star." As Donald finishes, the "iris out" effect which ends the cartoon closes on his neck. He struggles to force it open but it finally closes. This is a rare instance of a Disney cartoon breaking the fourth wall.'] ['Betty operates an auto repair garage for sick and injured automobiles.

Clara Cluck is in the orchestra in the beginning "rehearsal" sequences but not in the actual performance at the end. Other characters appearing in this short are Donald Duck, Clarabelle Cow and Horace Horsecollar. At one stage, Donald is so fed up with the chaos caused by the wrecked instruments that he packs his things and leaves. Mickey, determined to carry on come what may, points a gun at Donald\'s head to get him back into playing. This scene is missing in some versions of the short.'] ['Ambi aka Ramanujam Iyengar ([[Vikram  is an innocent and honest lawyer hailing from an orthodox Iyengar family.

Rimfire irately pushes Ella up the edge of the chasm back up to the jungle above, and Cool Cat helps Ella up to the top, not noticing Rimfire\'s presence, and accidentally knocks the hunter back into the chasm. Still thinking that Ella is a real elephant, Cool Cat leads her away by her trunk to demonstrate some survival skills, while Rimfire climbs out of the chasm for a second time. As Cool Cat leads Ella through the jungle, an amorous male elephant gives chase to Ella, but is then caught by Rimfire who makes the opposite mistake to Cool Cat and assumes that the male elephant is in fact Ella. After yanking at the elephant\'s skin  looking for an entry hatch, Rimfire finally realises that he is in fact dealing with a real elephant, who he then apologizes to, though this does not save him from being battered into the ground by the angry elephant\'s trunk. After recovering from his beating, Rimfire notices Cool Cat looking for food, and decides to throw him "an exploding pineapple" in the form of a hand grenade. Instead of yanking the grenade\'s pin out with his teeth however, Rimfire unknowingly pulls his dentures out of his mouth with the pin, and then tosses the unarmed grenade at Cool Cat. The tiger does mistake it for a pineapple and offers it to Ella, but after the mechanical elephant fails to react to it he tosses the grenade away, causing it to end up back with Rimfire. In turn, Rimfire mistakes the chattering dentures for a tarantula and whips out his shotgun to blast it, detonating the grenade and destroying his dentures. Rimfire then decides to hide in an abandoned bongo that he finds in the jungle and blast Cool Cat when he comes near, but Cool Cat plays Ella a tune on the bongo when he finds it, which leaves Rimfire dazed. He repeats his plan with a large bush, but Cool Cat decides to demonstrate some "Jungle Judo" on the bush, battering Rimfire in the process, then pushes Ella into the bush so that she can try the same thing, only for her to pass clean through the bush, then smash Rimfire on the side of a cliff. Exasperated, Rimfire finally gives up and tells Cool Cat that he\'s going to leave the jungle, only to discover that Ella has run out of petrol, and begins the 2000-mile journey to the nearest gas station. Cool Cat then opens Ella\'s rear hatch and checks the engine, and then remarks that "they just don\'t make elephants like they used to."'] ['Donald is taking a tour of the Grand Canyon. Although he just wants to enjoy the whole exhibition, this is made all but impossible by constant admonishment from the rulebook-wielding tour guide: none other than Ranger J. Audubon Woodlore. Donald and Woodlore continue to irritate each other - Donald by innocently tripping over various regulations , and Woodlore by chastising him for it - until Woodlore himself disturbs a mountain lion...the last one seen in these parts since the Civil War; it is, in fact, the same lion! Woodlore is caught in the middle as said cougar chases Donald through the Canyon, which results in most of it being destroyed . With all the other tourists having fled, Woodlore sternly - and rather insultingly - demands that both Donald and the lion dig another Grand Canyon to restore what they ruined; accordingly, he passes them a couple of shovels and yells out "So START DIGGING!!". Feeling extremely remorseful, Donald and the lion agree to do so and they start digging to restore the Grand Canyon back to its former glory while having moping faces.'] ['In an interview with Xtranormal, J Roland Kelly describes the film as "...basically this absurd, funny conversation between a guy and his girlfriend.

He and his weasel assistant, Weez Weezel, offer her fame and fortune in exchange for signing a contract in blood. Jan does not read the fine print and trusts B.L., signing herself over to his record production company.

Having nothing else to offer, Daniel begins to sing a heartfelt song. Jan joins in, as do her three heretofore unhelpful band members.

This short begins with Sam and Ralph enjoying breakfast  and walking to work. However, Sam appears far more bumbling while off duty in this short than in all the others, and he walks into trees on his way to work. Before the whistle blows, Sam falls off the end of his cliff, just barely catching the cliff with his foot. 1. As the whistle blows, Ralph is prepared to sprint toward the sheep, and even has a starting line drawn at his position. As he grabs a sheep and races back, Sam is climbing back onto his perch and unwittingly looses a rock on top of Ralph's head. Ralph races back to the position where he stole the sheep, puts it down, then races back to where the rock fell on his head, all while balancing the rock in position. Finally, he drops to the ground. 2. Ralph's next plan is to crawl under the grass of the field, lifting it like a carpet. After crawling under a sheep and trying to carry it away, Ralph is met with Sam, who has also crawled under the grass. Ralph attempts to run, but he's caught up in the grass, in much the same way as he was caught in the parachute in Ready, Woolen and Able. Sam punches Ralph and send him sliding to the edge of the grass, where his head sticks out and the bump on his head lifts the grass up further. 3. Ralph now decides to try using plate armour to protect himself from Sam. He fearlessly walks up to Sam and gives him a raspberry. Sam pulls Ralph out through his helmet by his tongue, then shoves him back through the helmet, upside down. Ralph walks away, frustrated and upside down. 4. Ralph takes the idea of using armour further and fashions a tank out of a cannon, some metal shielding, and a unicycle. It takes Ralph some time to get into position with the unwieldy unicycle, and almost falls off the cliff. Once he does get into position, Sam simply closes the flap over Ralph's gun, causing Ralph to blow himself up. Ralph circles around uncoordinated, and finally suffers gravity. 5. Ralph now attempts to burrow under Sam and deposit a reservoir of dynamite. After firing off the dynamite, the earth directly beneath Sam remains, while the circle of earth around him flies into the air. Naturally, one of the boulders lands on Ralph. 6. Ralph then notices a sheep drinking by the edge of the pond. He dons a full suit of diving gear and jumps off his own diving board made out of a plank and a rock. However, he doesn't jump forward enough and lands on the plank, which falls, sending the rock after it. Ralph and the plank land on another rock, creating a teeter totter, and when the falling rock lands on the other side Ralph is launched into the air and falls into Sam's arms. Ralph stands up and dives from there, falling head-first into the ground. Unfettered, Ralph swims through the earth with a front crawl. 7. Ralph finally decides to attempt every possible attack he can on Sam, all at once, and around Sam, he places a guillotine, two average sized cannons, two large cannons, an extremely large rocket, various melee weapons, and a series of gears under Ralph intends to pull the ground out from under him, dropping him into a pool of alligators, but before he can pull the master control switch, the punch clock whistle blows and he has to go home, so the two wish each other a good night."] ['1918 - After getting medals for "Wounds in action" , the Stooges are discharged from the army immediately following the end of World War I, whereupon they rough up Sgt.

That night they happily eat a supper of canned beans.'] ['Barnyard Dawg invites Foghorn to see a total eclipse for free.

On the placard with the product name, the dot above the "i" in "Pink" is a six-pointed asterisk. However, the moment he displays it, the asterisk turns green and the audience begins laughing. The Panther tries various stratagems  to change the asterisk back to pink, but it stubbornly changes back to green, turns the placard green, then jumps off the placard and begins taunting him, squirting green ink all over him.

Covered in bandages, the Panther limps back to the stage area and grimly puts up more placards advertising "Drink Green Punch", this time in all-green lettering with the asterisk proudly dotting the "i" of "Drink". Drinking the punch turns the Panther green. As he turns away, the asterisk turns itself pink.'] ["Raymand Goodfellow rides on a country road on his motor scooter. His voice over explains “You can’t control who you fall in love with, or who falls in love with you. Love doesn’t make sense.” The film flashes back to three months earlier to Ray’s time as a confident, self-centered lounge singer/dart thrower. Ray’s band consists of his friends Fozzie , Frank  and the “love of his life” Kelly . Before he joins the band onstage, Ray prays to God asking him for assistance in getting Kelly to love him. Despite Ray’s ongoing affection to her, she seems drawn to Fozzie who, claiming he's genuinely uninterested, is rejecting Kelly’s advances. After Ray’s crowd pleasing performance, he is informed by the bartender that someone has left a package for him. The package contains “love darts.” The instructions for the darts explain that when someone is poked with love dart they are immediately attracted to the first person they see. This attraction lasts for 6 hours. At the end of the 6 hours if the love is meant to last it will, but if the love wasn't meant to be, it won’t. Ray tells Fozzie about the darts and they both agree to have a test run. While the band walks home from a gig, Ray throws a love dart catching a prissy Jersey Girl named Angela. The first man she sees is Ray’s quiet, low-key bandmate Frank. Just as the instructions promised, Angela falls in love with Frank immediately. Ray and Fozzie follow the new couple around. After exactly six hours, Angela appears to still be in love with Frank and Ray declares the darts “effective.” Ray enlists Fozzie’s help in creating the “most romantic six hours” ensuring that Kelly will remain in love with Ray after the love dart’s initial power ends. Fozzie is able to offer several tips, knowing a surprising amount about Kelly and the things that are important to her. Ray goes to Kelly’s house and strikes her with a dart. As promised by the dart’s instructions, she immediately falls in love with him. They go on their date which goes perfectly. Towards the end of the six hours they kiss. When the six hours end, Kelly looks uncomfortable, thanks him for the evening, and leaves. It is clear that the love from the dart did not last. Ray consoles himself by poking one woman after another until he has a whole flock of women  who are completely in love with him for six hours. During this time all he can do is talk about getting Kelly to fall in love with him again. He even contemplates convincing her that she has diabetes so she has to poke herself with the love darts over and over again. The love darts wear off and he is alone again, ready to try his last dart on Kelly one more time. Walking home from another gig with his band, Ray prepares for his final throw at Kelly. Moments before throwing the dart he realizes that his loyal friend Fozzie is really in love with her and that she is really in love with him. Instead of striking Kelly with the dart, he hits Fozzie right as he looks up at Kelly. The two instantly fall in love with each other. A wiser and less self-centered Ray returns to his apartment.

Only the telephone cord prevents him from falling all the way to the ground, until Bugs rings up Wiley and—mimicking the phone company—remarks that because the Coyote hasn\'t paid his phone bill he will be cut off; Bugs snips the cord and Wile E. suffers gravity as usual. Bugs then reminds the audience to "never get cut off in the middle of a long-distance fall".'] ['In a cold winter, mother rabbit was going to look for some carrots outside the house. In case her child would feel lonely, she made a snowman for him, which was fabulous. The snowman started to move the moment she left. He had a great time with the little rabbit. But it was getting colder and colder, thus forcing the baby rabbit to go home and make a fire so as to get warm. Unfortunately, he fell asleep and his quilt fell on the floor, leaving the house in fire. The snowman saw this and rushed into the room without hesitation. Finally, he rescued his friend—the little rabbit at the cost of his own life. When the mother rabbit returned, she was relieved to find that her child was safe and sound, but the lovely snowkid disappeared forever.'] ['The cartoon begins at the Cook Shack of a ranch with Tom sleeping lazily as Jerry steals a sausage. The cook then calls Tom using a triangle, preparing dinner  for him but warning him that he can only eat when he gets rid of Jerry . The cook sends Tom away by shooting at him. First, Tom paints his finger the color of a sausage so that Jerry mistakes it for a sausage. Jerry then lassos the \'sausage\'. At first Tom get excited and smiles as if to say "got him!" Then he is being pulled by Jerry, Tom\'s expression goes from happy to a surprised look from Jerry\'s strength as if to say "uh-oh this isn\'t good" and Tom goes through the mouse hole. A chase follows, and just before Tom catches Jerry, Jerry pushes over a rake which rings the triangle. Tom drops Jerry and goes to collect his dinner. The cook takes it away and warns, "I said no dinner \'till you catch that mouse!" again shooting Tom away. The chase begins again, with Tom trying to lasso Jerry towards him, but he misses and catches the turkey instead. The cook once again shoots Tom away. Later on, Tom has prepared a trap, but Jerry sees it. He then comes up with a trick of his own: preparing a sandwich with the sleeping cook\'s hand in it and ringing the triangle. Tom grabs the \'sandwich\' and takes a bite: the cook yells in pain and shoots Tom away yet again, shooting several discrete holes in Tom which can be seen as water that he drinks comes back out through the holes. Jerry appears with a baton, but seeing Tom, runs away and does another \'sandwich\' trick, this time with a bull\'s tail. Tom takes a bite and is flung back to the shack. Tom sees Jerry with a piece of paper, which turns out to be a contract saying that in return for Jerry\'s co-operation, Tom would share his meals. The two shake hands, ready to co-operate. As the cook is peeling potatoes, gunfire can be heard and then seen as Tom \'shoots\' at Jerry so that the cook thinks that Tom is trying to get Jerry. Tom fires a few shots into the air as the cook gives Tom his dinner, giving endless praise. As Tom sits down to eat, Jerry whistles and reminds Tom about the contract. Tom fires several holes into it, as if to say "The deal\'s off!" before going back to his dinner. Jerry approaches and throws the dinner into Tom\'s face. In rage, Tom grabs a red-hot branding iron and chases Jerry. Tom is running flat-out as Jerry opens the shack door. Tom is unable to stop and runs right into the back of the cook, causing him to scream in pain and jump out of his boots and, seeing Tom as a traitor, runs after Tom, constantly shooting and with a burnt Circle-X brand on his trousers. Jerry watches, eating a turkey leg as the cook chases Tom into the sunset.'] ["Popeye, comes to Mexico to see Olive Oyl.He whomps up a few of the locals before going to the bar where Olive dances.

Dick Grayson, long since retired from his superhero days and married with a child, decides to resume his crime-fighting days as Robin; the filmmakers noted that many people outside the comic book community are unfamiliar with Nightwing. Sabloff and Fiorella wanted to appeal to a wider audience."Batmania Revisited, Part 2: Robin Returns", TheComicBookBin.com, 2005-06-23. Retrieved on 2008-07-07. Commissioner Gordon is aware of Grayson\'s secret identity and assists him by supplying official documents. In addition, Gordon provides the voiceover narration at the beginning of the trailer. The head of the investigation into Batman\'s death, O\'Hara, apparently also knows Grayson\'s identity  His role is suspicious since he strongly wants Grayson to not become involved, even to the point of aligning with Selina Kyle/Catwoman to eliminate Robin and shouting at reporter Clark Kent that he wants "him [presumably Grayson] out of the equation!" O\'Hara is also seen rolling up his sleeves, preparing to assault an angry captive Gordon. The extent of O\'Hara\'s apparent corruption is left unclear. * Grayson is aware of Superman\'s secret identity; he addresses him as "Clark". Superman apparently is also motivated  to discourage Grayson\'s return to crimefighting and three angry confrontations between the characters are shown, in and out of costume. Grayson is also angered to violence by the sight of a Superman comic-book, suggesting a strongly negative history between the two. Other comic books also appear of characters from the film, including Wonder Woman and Catwoman. Fiorella used his own comic book collection for this scene. * Longtime Batman villains the Penguin and the Riddler briefly appear, with a larger role taken by The Joker. A brief scene adapted from The Killing Joke appears, with Barbara Gordon crawling away from a door as the Joker breaks in. Afterwards, the Joker is seen walking through a park with the Graysons\' daughter. * In three brief appearances, Wonder Woman is shown deflecting bullets from her bracelets, snaring Robin in her golden lasso, and mourning over what appears to be the body of Superman. * The Green Lantern  has a momentary appearance, standing next to a fallen Robin, though the context is unexplained. *All in all, the trailer suggests the Justice League wants to stop Grayson from clarifying Batman\'s death. It is not known if they are ordered by or affiliated with O\'Hara. The filmmakers clarified that it was never their intention to portray the other superheroes as villains. They might be rather ordered to stop Dick because he is heading down a dangerous road.Schweier, Philip. "Batmania Revisited, Part 2: Robin Returns", TheComicBookBin.com, 2005-06-23.

Foghorn is seen awakening the dog by lifting him up by the tail and repeatedly slapping his rear end with a board which causes the dog to chase him. The dog is in pursuit but reaches a painted white line with a sign that reads "Rope Limit" which causes the dog to be jerked to a stop by the rope around his neck. Foghorn then takes a rubber ball and stuffs it in the dog\'s mouth, then punctures the ball with a needle causing the dog to fly away. As Foghorn leaves he walks past a wooden tower with a sign the reads "Don\'t Look Up". Foghorn naturally looks and sees the dog perched on the tower holding a watermelon which the dog releases, causing it to break over Foghorn\'s head. The dog\'s prank prompts Foghorn to contemplate "massive retaliation" against his nemesis. Daffy enters with his traveling salesman suitcase of novelty joke items and offers to help Foghorn get back at the dog by selling him a trick bone that is spring-loaded. The prank works and Daffy then intervenes to help the dog retaliate against Foghorn with a gift-wrapped corn-on-the-cob that is connected to an electrical wire. Naturally, Foghorn wants to get back at the dog with an even bigger prank and Daffy sells him something called the Chattanooga Choo-Choo which ends up backfiring on Foghorn. To make up for the Chattanooga Choo-Choo, Daffy offers to sell Foghorn an elaborate prank called the Pipe Full Of Fun Kit Number 7, which Foghorn purchases. As Foghorn is setting up the trap, he sees the dog setting up the same trap to use against him, and they both realize that Daffy has been playing them against each other . Foghorn and the dog join forces to go after Daffy, who attempts to flee but is instead victimized by the Pipe Full O\' Fun Kit, and Foghorn says "You know, there might I say there just might be a market for bottled duck.".'] ['The playlet involves a young woman coming home, tired, after a busy day at a war plant. Each time she comes in there is a letter from her husband overseas, and she remembers their conversations before he went off to war. She was concerned about him, because she felt it was a "young man\'s war" and he should stay home with her and the baby. However he was insistent that his country needed him. The plot then turns to the husband trying to manage his ship while it is being attacked by a submarine. The next day, the woman receives another letter from her husband, who is shown in double exposure, reminding her that freedom comes high, often at the price of human lives. The door bell rings, and it is a Western Union telegram, saying that her husband died. The point of the film was to communicate to the American people that many of their sons and husbands who were going overseas, would not be coming back, and that they would have to understand they would be sacrificing their loved ones to secure freedom. Given the extraordinary sensitivity of the subject matter, the government short is notable both as propaganda and as a meditation on what has to be sacrificed for the maintenance of freedom.'] ['When teenage Charity gets pregnant by her hideously shallow boyfriend, Billy, a shotgun wedding is quickly arranged — much to the dismay of Charity’s cousin, Jake.

Nearby, an opera singer named Giovanni Jones  rehearses "Largo al Factotum" from The Barber of Seville. Overhearing Bugs, he absent-mindedly finds himself singing along, and loses his temper over his rehearsal being interrupted in this manner. Giovanni angrily confronts Bugs and breaks the banjo strings and the banjo itself in half, crushing the neck and then slamming the body over Bugs\' head.  As Giovanni practices again, he hears Bugs singing "My Gal Is a High-Born Lady" and playing a harp. He tries to ignore Bugs, but again ends up singing and dancing along. Giovanni angrily confronts Bugs once again. He grabs Bugs by the throat, puts him in the harp, and crushes his neck inside the harp like a vise.  As Giovanni tries to sing again later, the sound of a Sousaphone seems to come out of his mouth. The sound is coming from Bugs playing "When Yuba Plays the Rhumba on the Tuba". Though the rabbit promptly ducks into his hole, Giovanni reaches down into the Sousaphone, pulls him out, ties him by his ears to a tree branch, and yanks him down so that he bounces up and down beneath the branch, bonking his head repeatedly. As Giovanni walks away, an enraged Bugs decides its time for payback, and says his famous line: "Of course you know, this means war!" Bugs exacts his revenge against Giovanni though a series of public humiliations during his concert . First, Bugs vibrates the roof of the concert hall to disrupt the singer\'s vocals. Then he hammers it so Giovanni moves across the stage and falls and gets trapped into a tuba. Bugs pulls him out and takes him backstage. Next Bugs sprays Giovanni\'s throat with "liquid alum" which shrinks his head as well his voice. Next, Bugs dresses up as a teenage bobby soxer and asks Giovanni for an autograph, only the pen is a stick of dynamite. After the off-screen explosion, Giovanni steps out to the stage with a singed face and evening wear torn to shreds. He takes a couple of bows and then collapses. During the concert\'s final act, Bugs poses as the highly respected Leopold Stokowski to take over the conducting duties, even breaking the baton and using his hands instead. Bugs makes Giovanni sing various notes, including a very low note. After accepting brief applause , Bugs cracks his knuckles, winds up his fists, and conducts Giovanni into holding a singular high G note until Giovanni can hardly endure the strain. His face turns different colors as he squirms and unravels his formal wear. Bugs leaves his glove hovering in the air and steps outside to order a pair of earmuffs which are delivered instantly after Bugs places the order in the mailbox. Bugs returns to the stage to find Giovanni has obeyed the glove and is still singing the high note but is now thrashing about on the floor banging his fists, his face still turning various colors. Finally, the top of the concert hall\'s shell shatters and tumbles down on top of Giovanni. For the encore, a roughed-up Giovanni appears out of the rubble to take a bow. Witnessing one last piece of the amphitheater balanced on a steel beam above Giovanni, Bugs again cues the singer to close out his performance with the high note so that the piece falls and crushes him off camera. Satisfied with his victory, Bugs removes his wig and ends the performance by playing the Vaudeville-era four-note tune, "Good Evening Friends", on a banjo.'] ['The year 1969. Kinshasa, Congo.

The camera then pans to Porky in front of a mirror, admiring himself in various poses with his new rifle and hunting suit. Porky points his shotgun at various imaginary aerial targets, then points it at his dog Rover; the dog runs under and into a bureau. Porky tells him the gun is not loaded and pulls the trigger to prove it. However, the shotgun actually is loaded and it fires into the ceiling. The man upstairs, shot in one butt cheek, comes down to punch Porky in the nose. The scene changes to a lake, pre-dawn. Porky spies a duck, but before he can get off a shot, lots of other previously hidden duck hunters suddenly appear and shoot at it for several seconds. They all miss. The duck hunters say "Aw, shucks!" in unison when they fail to shoot the duck. A cross-eyed duck hunter tries to shoot the same duck  but instead shoots down two airplanes. Porky puts out duck decoys. Daffy appears among them and acts like a fake duck. Porky tries to shoot Daffy after donning a decoy on his head and sneaking underwater, but the gun shoots out water instead of bullets. Daffy then flies onto a floating barrel . Porky shoots the whiskey-filled barrel but Daffy escapes. Some fish are attracted to the leaking barrel and get drunk. The fish come onshore, commandeer a boat and drunkenly sing \'On Moonlight Bay\'. Porky Pig observes that something is \'fishy\' with those fish. Porky then hears a quack nearby. When he looks into the grass, Daffy bites his nose. Daffy then takes to the sky; Porky shoots him with a single shot. Ecstatic, Porky instructs his dog Rover  and the dog swims out, but when he comes back, it\'s Daffy carrying the dog and throwing him back on the bank. Porky whips out a notepad, leafs through it and notes that this scene \'wasn\'t in the script\'  . Daffy yells out his first words, that he is "just a crazy, darn fool duck", and proceeds to do his signature \'crazy dance\' on the lake. After a humorous scene where Daffy eats an electric eel and turns into a lightning bolt, Porky tries hunting from a rowboat but is taunted by the ducks when he stops for lunch; in his hurry to fire at them he inadvertently sinks the boat, cueing Joe Penner to rise from underneath the water with his signature line "You wanna buy a duck?" After being alerted by his dog that Daffy is back, Porky makes several attempts to cock the gun and shoot, but the gun fails to fire each time. Daffy comes out of the water, takes the gun and fires it after the first cock. After saying "It\'s me again," Daffy does another crazy dance. Daffy takes to the air and is met by Porky shooting his gun rapid-fire and being driven into the ground by the recoil, apparently not hitting anything. Porky tries to use a duck call, but the other duck hunters mistake it for a real duck and shoot at Porky, who ducks for cover. Disgusted, Porky throws the duck call to the ground, but it bounces and his dog accidentally swallows it. The dog gets the hiccups, quacking with every one, drawing constant fire and forcing Porky and the dog to flee from the lake. Porky and the dog trudge home, disappointed with their failure to bag a duck. When Porky gets home, he sees the ducks outside doing a trapeze act in the sky at his window. Porky tries to shoot them with his gun but, thinking the gun empty, throws the shotgun to the floor. The gun fires into the ceiling. The cartoon ends with the man from upstairs, with his other butt cheek shot, coming down once again to punch Porky in the nose. The cartoon ends with Daffy jumping around the standard "That\'s all, Folks!" closing title, accompanied by "The Farmer In The Dell."'] ['In the fictional country of Moronica, three munitions manufacturers—Messrs.

This is likely inspired by the lyrics.On Your Mark FAQ The video begins with shots of a peaceful but vacant village, overgrown with weeds, with the enormous concrete sarcophagus of a covered-over nuclear reactor in the background. As the music begins, the scene changes to a sci-fi style nighttime military-style police raid on a cult. Futuristic flying troop transports crash through the windows of a tower topped by the gigantic neon-lit eyes and occupied by armed defenders. Anti-terrorist policemen exchange gunfire and grenades with cultists whose hoods depict an enormous eye, similar to those of the Dorok priests in Miyazaki\'s Nausicaa manga. The police are victorious; as they sort through the bodies of the cultist, two of them find what appears to be a girl, lying unconscious, with large feathered wings on her back. The scene changes again, now to bright daylight and blue sky. Two men are driving an old Alfa Romeo down an empty road. One of them helps the girl up; she spreads her wings; he holds her hands as she gains confidence. With a nudge she is airborne, but she seems hesitant and afraid as he lets go. The scene changes back to the discovery of the girl in the tower . Only at this point are the two men revealed to be the two from the vehicle in the previous sequence. The two men carefully carry her out and offer her something to drink, and are encouraged when she sips. But a team of scientists wearing radiation suits arrives and quickly takes the girl away after placing her into a sterile container. The two men are shown relaxing later, but thinking of the girl and looking somewhat morose — haunted by the fate this girl will suffer. The two plan — they are shown working on various aspects of this, then the pair wearing radiation suits and breaking into a laboratory and rescuing the girl. This triggers the lab\'s alarms, and the three of them escape in an armored truck. They drive along a narrow suspended roadway over what appears to be a domed city built in a crater. Police hovercrafts are in pursuit, and one of them comes very low to the roadway right in front of the fugitives. When the protagonists try to force their way through underneath the hovercraft\'s belly, the resulting pressure tears down the roadway, sending the truck plummeting. The winged girl refuses to let go of the hands of her rescuers, and the three of them presumably fall to their deaths. A brief montage of previous shots follows: the discovery of the girl, the girl flying through a blue sky, the two men rescuing the girl from the laboratory and stealing the truck, the truck plummeting amidst the wreckage of the roadway. But this time, as if inexplicably the main characters had gotten a second chance, the truck fires stabilising thrusters and makes a short flight into the side of an apartment tower. The men and the girl escape; they are seen in their sports car racing through a dark tunnel underneath signs which bear radiation symbols and read  "Beware Of Sunlight" and "Survival Not Guaranteed", then finally they emerge into daylight, passing through a field of nuclear cooling towers and past a sign which reads "Extreme Danger." Except for the green fields and trees, there are no other signs of life. As the car speeds down the road, one of the men helps the girl up, and she spreads her wings and gives them a grateful smile; he kisses her hand, and the other winks in farewell. Soon, she is gone drifting upward into the sky. Briefly, a major urban cityscape is seen beyond the trees. From a bird\'s-eye view, we see the shape of the car veering off the road and slowing to a stop in the grass. Hayao Miyazaki implies the two policemen might not be able to return to their old life, however; whether this is because of the authorities being on their trail or because of potential radioactive poisoning is unknown.{{citation}}.'] ['In the story, Johnny Lingo  is a shrewd Polynesian trader. It is actually told from the perspective of a Caucasian shopkeeper . Lingo has come to one island to bargain for a wife. Mahana , the young woman he desires, is considered by her neighbors and even her father to be of little value, sullen, ugly and undesirable. As the bargaining is about to begin, women of the island brag to each other of how many cows their husbands had given for each of them, and comment that Mahana\'s father will be lucky to see one cow as Lingo\'s offer. The counselor advises Mahana\'s father to ask for three cows so that finally, Moki  will at least get one cow. The bargaining begins and as the counselor suggested Moke asked Johnny Lingo three cows. Islanders laugh derisively, then wait for Lingo to make his counter-offer, certain that he will make a devastating bargain. Lingo, considering, says that three cows are many . . ."But not enough for my Mahana!" He then offers the unheard-of price of eight cows for her hand in marriage. The next day, the villagers gather at the house of Mahana\'s father to see the completion of the deal. Some of the islanders say that Lingo reconsidered his deal and would not show up. But Lingo brings the cows. He and Mahana then leave the island on a trading trip. When they come back, the island storekeeper, Harris , discovers, to his astonishment, that Mahana is a beautiful, happy woman. Even Mahana\'s father began accusing Johnny Lingo of cheating him by giving only eight cows for a girl truly worth ten cows.

After being scalped playing cowboys and Indians, Daffy -- after being shown the bank book -- is made to take Wentworth to the amusement park. There, Daffy tries his luck at a shooting gallery, but each time the duck takes a shot, Wentworth uses a slingshot to bean the back of the barker\'s head; eventually, the angry barker socks Daffy. His disgusted wife assumes that Daffy is "fried to the gills" and orders him to bed, since he\'s got to help Wentworth shoot off fireworks on the Fourth of July. The holiday begins with Daffy taking the brunt of a fireworks mishap, followed by Wentworth disguising himself as a lit firecracker. Daffy, wanting to teach the brat a lesson, thinks he\'s found him and begins to discipline him -- only to see the disguised Wentworth racing by, just seconds before the firecracker explodes. The woman duck then demands that Daffy take Wentworth to the zoo. Despite a threat from his wife to pluck every feather from his body, Daffy stands his ground, "No zoo.". He then walks out the door with packed suitcases in hand, retorting, "Nobody\'s going to tell this little black duck what to do!" His body  has been stripped clean of feathers, just as his now ex-wife had promised.'] ["The film follows Craig's relationships over a twenty year period using answer phone tapes and photos of the time.

As the cartoon proper begins, a lion on roller skates  rushes from his guard post atop a mountain, racing into a nearby village crying "Look out! The Old Man of the Mountain!" The lion\'s warning sparks a mass exodus of the other animals who pack up their things and start to flee as the lion continues to warn "Look out! The Old Man of the Mountain!" In time, Betty Boop emerges from a guest house in order to find out what is going on. She confronts a passing owl, who in song describes the Old Man of the Mountain, a predatory hermit who threatens the livelihood of the villagers, particularly the women. Despite the owl\'s warnings, Betty is curious and declares, "I\'m going up to see that old man of the mountain", and starts a trek up the mountainside. She passes several people fleeing from the Old Man, including a woman pushing a carriage with her triplets—who look suspiciously like the Old Man of the Mountain. When Betty gets to the top of the mountain, the Old Man of the Mountain emerges from behind a rock. Over twice as tall as Betty, the Old Man backs the girl into his cave and, as Betty fights off his advances, begins to sing with her a duet of  "You\'ve Got to Hi-De-Hi." Betty loosens up and joins in, and the two begin to flirt with each other. After his first verse, the Old Man looms menacingly over Betty. "Whatcha gonna do now?" Betty asks, frightened. "Gonna do the best I can," the Old Man replies, launching into a jazzy dance routine. The Old Man and Betty continue to dance together, but when the song is over, the Old Man makes a lustful grab for Betty, who runs for her life back down the mountainside. The Old Man makes chase, and grabs Betty just long enough to catch hold of her dress, which Betty jumps out of. As Betty finds refuge behind a large tree in her underwear, her dress comes to life and slaps the Old Man before running back to its owner. Betty climbs the tree to apparent safety, but as the Old Man comes over and attempts to coax her down with  "The Scat Song", he picks the tree up and bounces it on the ground, causing Betty to slide down. Before he can have his way with her, however, the animals from the village rally to Betty\'s aid and surround the Old Man, tying his arms and legs together by a tree. They then proceed to beat him up, tickle and humiliate him, thus extracting revenge for all the times he had made their lives a misery, with Betty watching with glee.'] ['"pinion">new sweat to drown me in: pinion Cutting back to the amateur video, the killer, wearing some sort of leather mask, drags the victim\'s head back and forces him to drink some sort of liquid from a jerrycan. The middle of the video for "Wish" is interrupted by amateur footage again with the victim chained to a table with a large wad of dark substance on his face. As the killer is immediately followed to be seen putting his pants on, it could be assumed that it is feces. After the video ends, the killer repeatedly rewinds to the part of the video where Reznor screams "fist fuck" and begins to rub his fist. The video for "Help Me I Am in Hell" shows a middle-age bald man in a room filled with flies. He ignores them while eating some sort of steak and drinking wine. On one occasion it is clearly shown that flies also enter his mouth when he eats. The video cuts away several times to show the same man in bondage gear. This video was blacked out in the most prominent leak;new sweat to drown me in: help me i\'m in hell it is now generally believed  that this sequence is part of the complete film but was blacked out by Reznor in the bootlegged copy. Reznor is rumored to have distributed copies of Broken to his friends, each with a different part of the video blacked out, so that if it were bootlegged, he would be able to identify the source of the leak.  Following the video, the victim is shown still tied to a table as the killer proceeds to rip his teeth out. The video for "Happiness in Slavery" shows up, which was banned by music video channels worldwide.new sweat to drown me in: happiness in slavery It features a man  stripping off his clothes and settling down on a machine that tortures, rapes and later kills him. The film ends with a video for "Gave Up" - this is different from the one on Closure, as it is not an actual Nine Inch Nails video, but the music of NIN dubbed over the storyline of the movie. At this point, the victim is suspended from the ceiling, and is repeatedly attacked by the perpetrator first with a blade, then a blowtorch, after which the killer slices off the victim\'s penis with a straight razor. The camera-work here closely resembles that of an amateur snuff film, while there is interspersed footage of the police searching through the basement, and finding remains of previous victims.  Finally, the film cuts back to the victim strapped on a table, as the murderer hacks his limbs off with a chainsaw, proceeds to presumably rape him, and finally slices his chest open to eat his heart. The movie then cuts back to the execution scene, showing as the killer is dropped through the trap door, with a crazed smile on his face, falling through a seemingly immensely long tunnel, until the rope suddenly tightens. The movie ends with the inverted version of the Broken album cover, with the background black, and a mirrored "n" character filled with the original orange background texture. The severed head of the killer flying across the screen is also shown after 30 seconds of no audio and a black screen. In versions of the tape labeled as "Techno-necrophilia", the movie is followed by a segment of Robert "Budd" Dwyer\'s televised suicide. It does not appear on the "leaked" DVD version - it is possible that it was merely added by a third party while the tape was circulating.'] ['Pudgy the Puppy, out for a stroll, meets a mean bulldog.

It begins with Cavis Appythart and Millward Phelps—jingle writers who decide to make their big break into musical theatre. While Millward is content to see their work featured on billboards and in newspapers, Cavis believes they can make a difference in crime-ridden London by staging a grand musical that will move the citizens to greater expressions of love. Their opportunity arises when Millward\'s Uncle Nezzer grants them the use of his theater on Christmas Eve. They plan the huge production of a new musical called "The Princess and the Plumber". Unfortunately, the script is not yet complete, and the premiere is only three days away. Seymour Schwenk , their friend and an inventor, shows up in an experimental rocket car (a direct reference to [[Chitty Chitty Bang Bang  and delivers a box of light bulbs to them. Cavis maintains that if their production is glitzy and bright (electric lights are still a novelty at this time and were first introduced at the Savoy Theatre for Gilbert and Sullivan\'s [[Patience  then it will be a bigger hit and reach more people. He plans to integrate the lights directly into the scenery itself . However, they still have much work to do. They need to convince the city\'s premiere talent, Constance Effie Pickering, to star in the lead role, and they need to get a commitment from Prince Calvin Fredrick to attend the premier. While Cavis and his assistant Bob Winston work on Pickering and the Prince, Millward struggles to complete the script. Everything comes together, and Cavis starts feeling confident that their production will be a huge success. The Prince tells Pickering that her pipes are corroded they water can\'t drain and her toilet exploded, she\'s flushing in vain. After noticing a flyer for a Christmas pageant planned to debut on the same night at a local church, Cavis goes to investigate. He observes Edmund Gilbert preparing a low-budget children\'s play, and concludes that it poses no threat to their grand production. However, the pageant intends to feature an object called the "Star of Christmas". Wondering aloud about this as he leaves the church, Cavis is overheard by Arthur McHollingshead. Arthur, a historian, reveals that the Star of Christmas is an ancient relic that has not been seen by the public in 79 years. He rushes off with great excitement to report the news, which promptly makes the front page headline the following morning. Faced with the prospect of losing their audience  to the pageant, Cavis vows to make their own production greater and flashier. But they can\'t compete with the Star of Christmas, and in desperation Cavis and Millward go to the church to steal the Star. They are caught, however, and narrowly escape from the aged "Moyer the Destroyer" who was left to guard the relic. With the Star and the flashy lights, Cavis is certain that "The Princess and the Plumber" is now a guaranteed success. But during dress rehearsal, the excessive amount of lights  ignite the curtains. In minutes the theater goes up in flames and with it the Star of Christmas. As they stand and rue this terrible turn of events, an officer named Dwiglight Howarde arrives with Moyer LaGumtree, and Cavis and Millward are arrested. In the jail, they meet a prisoner, Charles Pincher, who laughs at their efforts to spread love by means of an elaborate stage production. He claims that real love does not expect fame or wealth in return, that real love makes sacrifices to help others without expectation of personal gain. That kind of love, he says, is extremely rare. As if on cue, Edmond and his father, Jesse, arrive at the jail to release Cavis and Millward. They have chosen not to press charges for the theft of the Star. Cavis is moved, and he expresses his desire to attend the pageant. But the pageant starts in ten minutes and there is not enough time to get there. Just then Seymour shows up in this rocket car. He entrusts Millward to drive the vehicle and try to get them all to the church on time. It\'s a harrowing ride fraught with collisions and near-misses, but they do arrive just as the pageant is about to start to crash through a bakery and a bank. The pageant goes on with the Prince and Miss Pickering and everyone else in attendance. Cavis finally learns that Christmas is not about glitz and grand productions; he understands that it is about a baby in a manger, Jesus, who is the real "Star of Christmas". After the play, Moyer shows up and says that the real Star of Christmas  is actually safe, and that they actually took the Turtle of Damascus, which most people consider a hoax. The episode ends with Cavis and Millward performing a selfless act at last: they bring cookies and a gift to Charles Pincher in his jail cell, Cavis says, smiling warmly, "Merry Christmas Mr. Pincher".'] ["Karl pays his girlfriend Julie a surprise visit while she is babysitting her neighbour's children.

Just then, a visiting artist spots the Tramp and the woman and offers them a job to pose for a painting. The two agree. The artist offers to pay for the Tramp and the woman's meal, but the Tramp declines the offer several times for reasons of etiquette, intending to eventually accept the artist's offer; however, he's dismayed when the artist does not renew his offer to pay at the last moment. The artist pays for his own meal and leaves a tip for the waiter. The Tramp notices that the tip is enough to cover the couple's meal and, without the artist noticing, palms the tip and presents it to the waiter as his own payment for his and the woman's meal. As a final riposte, he lets the waiter keep the remaining change - one small coin - after paying his bill. The waiter thinks the artist himself has given no tip whatsoever, and is clearly upset at this supposed action. Afterwards, outside a marriage license office in the rain, the Tramp proposes marriage to the woman, who is coy and reluctant until the Tramp physically carries the laughing girl into the office."] ['The Stooges are vaudeville entertainers who trek to Mexico to perform their gag bull fight shtick, with Joe as the brave matador, and Moe and Larry dressed in a bull costume.

In a morgue where the lifeless body of a girl lies, waiting to be identified, a man and a woman, who introduce themselves as the parents of the victim, are distraught over the loss of the young girl. However, after a moment\'s hesitation, a morgue employee claims the body of the girl. The grotesque controversy about who is the real "owner" of the corpse and the legitimate beneficiary of the money starts here. Between turn of events and paradoxical punishments of fate, the ending leads to a tragic and ironic conclusion. In black and white, the whole story is set in the cold morgue, where the characters\' absurd and pathetic dialogues take place, like a journalist and a police detective who keep on squabbling. Halfway between Hitchcock and Polanski, Judgement reveals all Park\'s irony about a shabby, ignorant and greedy humanity, that does not hesitate to come to vile compromises for money.'] ["A young Polar Bear cub chases a bird and is captured by sea men on a ship after he is spotted.

However, "King of Crooners" Alfalfa , the intended star of the show, crashes the show full of swing music with his off-key rendition of "The Barber of Seville", having secretly decided that he\'s only going to sing opera from now on. After Spanky closes the curtain on Alfalfa and sends out another act to replace him, the would-be opera prodigy walks out on the show, taking his voice "where it\'ll be appreciated!" With Porky  as his right-hand man/hanger on, Alfalfa turns up at the Cosmopolitan Opera House, wanting to appear in their next opera. Barnaby ([[Henry Brandon , the impresario of the Cosmopolitan, jokingly offers the young boy a contract - provided he come back in twenty years. Elated, Alfalfa returns to Spanky\'s cellar with Porky, gloating about his presumed good fortune and illustrious future in the face of Spanky\'s pleas for Alfalfa to appease his customers and take the stage. Spanky tears into his best friend, telling him that "someday I\'ll be a big producer on Broadway, and you\'ll be singing your opera in the streets with a tin cup in your hand!" Alfalfa brushes off Spanky\'s warnings, and sits down to rest . Alfalfa falls asleep backstage, and dreams that the twenty years have elapsed and he and Porky are waiting at the steps of a Broadway opera house. Barnaby, now a wizened old man, has decorated Broadway with lighted signs heralding Alfalfa\'s opera debut, and invites Alfalfa in to perform. However, when the opera house curtains finally open, Alfalfa barely gets through a few bars of "The Barber of Seville" before the audience members begin to boo him and pelt him with rotten vegetables. An angry Barnaby literally throws Alfalfa out into the streets. Bound by the iron-clad contract he signed twenty years ago, Alfalfa is forced to sing for pennies in the cold, snowy streets of New York. Hungry, tired, and broke, Alfalfa and Porky happen upon a shocking sight several blocks away: "Club Spanky", an ornate nightclub on Broadway. Sure enough, Spanky himself, now rich and famous, rides up in a limousine to greet them, and graciously invites them inside for something to eat. Club Spanky is a child\'s dream fantasy of a New York nightclub, with decor derived from toy blocks and candy canes, and a menu which includes hamburgers, ice cream, and jellybeans. Darla, dressed in furs and diamonds, comes over to sit at Spanky\'s table. She tells Alfalfa that she performs at Club Spanky, and is now rich and making "hundreds and thousands of dollars." Alfalfa gets a second shock when he learns that Buckwheat  is still Spanky\'s bandleader, and is also rich, dripping with diamonds, and making "hundreds and thousands of dollars." Spanky offers to let Alfalfa and Porky work for him again; Porky immediately accepts the offer, but the stubborn Alfalfa declares himself "a slave to my art" and refuses to "croon". Instead, Alfalfa sits and watches Club Spanky\'s lavish floor show, with featured songs by Spanky, Darla, Buckwheat, Porky, and several other performers, supported by large, ornate sets and scores of dancers. At the show\'s conclusion, Alfalfa finds himself so impressed with the show that he decides to go back to "crooning". Spanky announces the return of the "King of Crooners" to a rapturous crowd, but before Alfalfa can begin to sing, Barnaby storms into the club, and begins to drag Alfalfa back out into the streets to sing opera. By now, Alfalfa is complaining that he doesn\'t want to sing opera anymore, but Barnaby only laughs and continues to drag Alfalfa towards the door. The Club Spanky patrons\' cries of "we want Alfalfa" melt into those of the kids in Spanky\'s cellar. Alfalfa awakens to find Spanky, not Barnaby, tugging at his arm, begging for Alfalfa to at least join in the last act and croon for the kids. Alfalfa needs no further convincing, and rushes onstage with Spanky, Porky, Darla, and the other kids to sing Bing Crosby\'s "Learn to Croon" for the show\'s finale.'] ['In this cartoon, Goofy provides an educational treatise on swimming and diving with questionable results.'] ['The Pink Panther is featured in a series of 12 skits, each one ending when the screen "pinks out." *Public clean-up week - the panther uses a brace and bit to obtain paint from the painter above him, only to have the painter below him perform the same trick *Home wrecking - the panther tries to demolish a condemned home, only to have he and his wrecking ball fall to pieces *Hourglass beach - the panther is relaxing on what appears to be a beach, but he sinks into the sand and falls into what is revealed to be the bottom of an hourglass *Hungry - while trying to rummage something to eat, the panther gets desperate and folds the screen backdrop into a finger-sized square and eats it, resulting in the backdrop springing back to full size inside the panther\'s stomach *Tightrope elephant - the panther tries to move an elephant off his tightrope *Military - the G.I. panther battles an armed centipede *Sailboat painting - the panther straightens a crooked picture of an ocean sailboat, only to have the ocean water in the painting leak onto the floor *Bathtub surfing - the panther appears to be performing daredevil surfing stunts, only to reveal he is based in his bathtub *Sunday afternoon lawn mowing #1 - while mowing his lawn, the panther is attacked by an angry stork while attempting to cut down a large bush *The Great Pinko - the magician panther saws a fake panther in half, only to have his own body split in two *Pink balloon - the panther helps a child inflate a balloon *Sunday afternoon lawn mowing #2 - while mowing his lawn again, the panther attempts to cut down the same large bush, only to have the foundation give way underneath him'] ["In England, Ralph Frawley is arrested for rabbit poaching and transported to Van Diemen's Land as a convict.

He ducks into his hole when a small bird  zooms past. He then sees a deer jump over him, and wonders "what\'s all the excitement about?" Then a whole stampede of animals appears, and Bugs tries to ask them what\'s going on, but all of his "What\'s up, doc?" queries go unanswered. He manages to stop a turtle by putting a shovel in front of him. Bugs asks the turtle what was happening, with the turtle explaining that "the Tasmanian Devil\'s on the loose! Run! Run! Run for your life!". Bugs then goes back into his hole and looks in the encyclopedia to find this character in it. This cartoon, in fact, is the Tasmanian Devil’s first appearance in Warner Bros.\' Looney Tunes cartoons. Bugs Bunny gets himself into this situation because he offers to help the disheveled Tasmanian Devil find his dinner. The following quote illustrates Bugs’ realization that Taz is in fact a threat and danger to him: "Q..R..S..T, Tasmanian ... Here it is! \'A strong, murderous beast, jaws powerful as a steel-trap &mdash; has ravenous appetite &mdash; eats tigers, lions, elephants, buffaloes, donkeys, hippopotamuses, rhinoceroses, giraffes, octopuses, moose, ducks," the Tasmanian Devil then appears next to him and interjects, "Rabbits". Bugs, not noticing him at first, states that "It doesn\'t say rabbits here..." but Taz handwrites it into the encyclopedia, thus getting the rabbit\'s attention. That is when Bugs Bunny realizes that he is in danger and that the Tasmanian Devil could in fact potentially attack and eat him. He then convinces Taz that he  would not satisfy his appetite. He tells him that groundhogs would do so; Bugs hands him a shovel and ends up burying him. Just when Bugs thinks he\'s done with him, the Tasmanian Devil asks: "What for you bury me in the cold, cold ground?" Taz then attacks him, Bugs then feigns smelling chicken nearby which excites Taz. Bugs makes the chicken from liquid bubble gum and baking soda which Taz immediately devours. He then starts hicupping and creates a giant bubble and begins to drift away. Bugs takes out a slingshot and shoots Taz down causing him to become entangled in the gum caught in a tree branch. Next Bugs makes a pig out of an inflatable raft. Taz swallows it and Bugs pulls the string causing the raft to inflate inside of him. Then Bugs creates a deer out of wood. He then sees the Tasmanian Devil after him and climbs up a tree, which Taz chomps down on causing it to become smaller with each bite. Bugs diverts his attention to the crudely made wooden deer  and tells him to knock it out with a giant slingshot . As Taz pulls down on the slingshot, Bugs saws down the tree that is used for the slingshot causing Taz to go flying off and crash.

Foghorn lectures Sylvester to "Bury the hatchet-I say bury the hatchet, but not in anyone\'s head, boy!" when Sylvester is trying to speak, Sylvester angrily yells "Ah, SHUT UP!" and whacks Foghorn on the head with the bladeless axe and leaves as Foghorn sees stars and still holds the blade.

Cats don\'t lay eggs! There\'s something screwy here!" and attempts to detach himself from this egg that suddenly follows him and attaches itself to him and that literally scares Sylvester out of his wits when he thinks the egg is possessed by a ghost. He runs from it and literally does all sorts of things...including running into the dog house belonging to the Barnyard Dawg. The dog pulls the cat out and stomps all over him and walks off. Henery, still in the egg, runs into the dog, which causes the dog to trip and fall over. The dog looks at the egg and then at the camera and ponders "I just takes a step and presto, I lays an egg!". the scene fades to a mother duck, with her ducklings, who says to herself "Presto, and he lays an egg. And to think for fifteen years, I\'ve been doing it the hardway." The egg/Henery finally discovers Sylvester\'s hiding spot, and he starts to attach himself to Sylvester\'s skin. Reaching a breaking point, Sylvester comes close to literally smashing the egg with a Mallet...just as the egg is about to be smashed, Henery pops out and hollers "STOP!!" to which Sylvester, in a classic scene, literally yanks his head up and down by his ears and grabs his tail and literally yanks on it, causing his head to literally pop up and down on his shoulders because he himself thinks he\'s crazy. Henery, seeing enough, clobbers Sylvester with a mallet and drags him off. Sylvester wakes up and asks "Say, what\'s the big idea?!" and Henery warns the "chicken" to not give him any trouble and Sylvester realizes that he\'s been part of a trick and he leaps up and shows Henery that the actual chicken, "A ROOSTER in fact!", is Foghorn himself. "Rooster? If I\'m a rooster-I say if I\'m a rooster, I hope to be struck by-" bellows an offended Foghorn, but is interrupted when he almost literally gets struck by lightning and decides "Well, let\'s put it in another way. WAY that is" and an argument arises between Sylvester, Foghorn, and the Dog as they accuse each other of misleading Henery Hawk. Finally, Henery decides the only way to settle the matter is to see who crows at dawn, and they all agree with an "OKAY!" with Foghorn alone "OKAY,THAT IS!". The scene fades and it\'s dawn the next morning...a sun pops up...and rooster crowing is heard...but from who? Sylvester has his mouth open because he typically always has his mouth open, looking dumbfounded...but Barnyard Dawg thinks Sylvester is crowing and walks off after hearing enough and Henery mistakes this for the sound of the rooster and he drags Sylvester away. The scene ends with Foghorn crowing...out the side of his mouth...holding up a how-to book on ventriloquism. Foghorn tells the audience "You gotta-I say you gotta keep on your toes. TOES that is!".'] ['Herr Spring, a fat German cuckoo clockmaker, finds that after completion of a new clock, he now needs a cuckoo bird to occupy it.

There is a clash between the progressive, educated elements of society - those who desire westernization and modernity- and traditionalists who want to maintain Nigerian heritage. Two young African teachers, Iruka and Dominic  decide the village of Udi should have a maternity home, itself a symbol of progressiveness and modernization. The British District Officer, E.R. Chadwick , after some persuasion, assents to this decision and agrees to provide the resources for the project. Before work can begin, Chadwick wants to ensure that everyone in the village is on-board for the task, but it quickly becomes clear that this is not the case. A man named Eze , an elderly resident, believes that building the maternity home is both an affront to the tradition and culture of the village, and works to persuade others towards his view. Chadwick visits the village in an attempt to convince the villagers otherwise, a task in which he ultimately succeeds. Work on the maternity home begins in earnest. Although it will prove a long, arduous process, the villagers band together to construct the building. They are interrupted by Eze, who arrives at the building site and claims that it is an old burial ground. He predicts that the builders will invoke the ire of the ancestors for disturbing the site and violating custom. Cultural values quickly manifest. Fear and superstition briefly stop the work, but Chadwick and Dominic arrive to allay the workers\' fears and restart the building project. However, Eze’s threat looms large in the back of their minds. In time the building is complete, but before it is set to officially open, a young woman and her husband arrive in the village. The woman is in labor, and so Chadwick and the midwife  agree to admit the woman as the home\'s first patient. That evening, while tending the woman, the midwife catches sight of movement and hears noises coming from outside. Frightened, she soon hears a knock at the door, but it turns out only to be Iruka coming to check up on the expectant mother. Relieved, the midwife resumes her work while Iruka sets a pot of water to boil on the fire. Shortly thereafter, there is another noise, and when looking out the window the midwife spots a masked figure peering in. Believing the masked figure to be a spirit of the ancestors, the midwife cries out in fear, but Iruka throws the boiling water onto the figure, revealing Eze, who flees back into the surrounding overgrowth. The next day the villagers march up to the maternity home for the opening ceremony, a traditional one complete with dancing, music, singing, and native costumes. Chadwick takes the center seat in front of the maternity home to watch the events, with, interestingly enough, Eze sitting near him. Eze has finally accepted that tradition and progress, as visible in the final scene, can go together after all. In the closing narration, Chadwick tells the viewer that progress brings "power, spirit, unlimited and unknown possibilities and destinations" and suggests that progress should be the ultimate goal of native society.'] ['An Irish boy  emigrates to America to escape the desperate poverty of Ireland.

In much the same manner as an imaginary friend acts, \'The Big Guy\' never responds until he finally becomes fed up with Citizen 43275-B and declares that he does not like being called \'The Big Guy\' - but this intervention serves only to worsen Big Brother\'s predicament, as 43275-B enthusiastically hugs the telescreen and goes on to "amuse" him through a variety of ways: sock puppets, Boggle, hide and seek, one-sided pillow fights, and knock-knock jokes. As this further frustrates him, Big Brother finally announces the true nature of himself and society by telling 43275-B: {{cquote}} Big Brother eventually shuts off the telescreen in disgust and frustration.

The appearance in the opening scenes of a volume entitled "RE-EDUCATION MANUAL" on 43275-B\'s bookshelf, references to a "re-education lectures," and the fact that he has a diary already set aside, all imply that this is not his first attempt, and suggests his behavior was deliberate.'] ["In a 19th century fishing harbor, the captain of the Komquot is obsessed with catching the great white whale Dicky Moe.

Through the voices of former child soldiers, the film examines why these children joined the Maoists and explores the prevention of future recruitment. The children describe their dramatic recruitment and participation in the Maoist People’s Liberation Army during the eleven-year civil war between the Maoist insurgents and the Hindu monarch of Nepal. The girls’ stories demonstrate how voluntarily joining the violent Maoist struggle became their only option to escape the gender discrimination and sexual violence of traditional Hindu culture in Nepal. With the major conflict ended and the Maoists in control of the government, these children are now in United Nations cantonments, and return home to communities and families that want nothing to do with them.

The men walk along a jetty and then dive into the water, only to then swim to the shore line and repeat the process again.'] ['At the start of the film the narrator, Danny  introduces the viewer to his friends. We see the children playing while, back at Danny\'s house, a tea party is being prepared for them. As the farmer opens a gate and drives his tractor through the field where the children are playing, Kim jumps up onto the trailer part, pretending the tractor is a train and shooting at it, while her friends are following behind. The tractor makes a turn, and she falls off and is run over, and the camera focuses on the horrified expressions of the other children, followed by close-ups of a large pool of blood on the ground and a broken toy gun. We then see the class teacher back at the children\'s school, removing the name tag from the storage peg for Kim\'s coat. In the next scene, the children are playing in the fields again as their parents prepare to go to the tea party. The boys want to play Football but the game changes to kick the can instead. While hiding from Danny, Tom walks along the top of the fence surrounding the slurry pit, but falls in. As he calls out for his friends, he is shown to slowly sink into the slurry and drown. We see that the children at the village school have been given a day off because of his death, and the class teacher is shown removing the books and toys from Tom\'s desk. Back at Danny\'s house, the table is being set for the children\'s party, and the children are again playing at being cavalry and later "Apaches." When the game finishes, the children wander into an equipment shed, and Danny picks up a bottle of chemicals, suggesting they "celebrate our victories by drinking the white man\'s fire water."  The contents are poured into a mug but the more cautious Michael points out that they don\'t know if this would be dangerous to drink. The children discuss whether or not the contents might be poisonous, and pass the mug around to sniff. They agree to mime-drink it just in case. Sharon takes the mug and accidentally swallows some of the liquid ; she spits it out and seems to be fine, but as the children go home, she is seen coughing and looks unwell. Later that night, Sharon is heard screaming for her mother; the next shot is of her parents clearing out what had been their daughter\'s bedroom, with a close up of the now empty bed. Danny comments that he does not understand why grown-ups drink. His parents pour whiskey from a bottle that looks exactly like the one Sharon drank from, showing how easy it would be for a child to mistake them. Later, the remaining children are again playing in the fields, and one of them narrowly avoids being run over by a tractor like the first victim. They are chasing each other, pretending to be characters from the television series Starsky and Hutch, when Michael accidentally dislodges a heavy iron gate and Robert is crushed beneath it. The camera focuses on the shocked expressions of the other two children as they watch the lifeless body, blood streaming from the ear, as more people arrive for the party. There are now only two children left, and Danny decides to go off on his own and look for more kids to play with him and Michael. He walks through the cemetery where his friends are buried, and meets some farmworkers at the top of the hill going for their break. He asks if he can sit on the tractor, and the driver says yes - but to be careful. In voiceover, Danny as "Geronimo" states that there will always be hope for the Apaches as long as one of them is left alive. He plays behind the wheel pretending to be driving a racing car but accidentally releases the handbrake, and it careers down the slope as the farmer rushes to help him. The exterior of the tractor is shown as the camera focuses on the body of Danny in the tractor . His parents are then shown in his empty bedroom, the mother sits miserably in the room shaken by the events. There are funeral scenes of Danny\'s coffin being buried as the vicar commits him to the ground, before the mourners move on to the wake. Danny, whom we now know to be dead, talks calmly about his family all arriving for the "party" being prepared earlier in the film. Michael, also present, is revealed to be Danny\'s cousin - the only child not to have been killed by his own reckless behaviour, despite Danny having described Michael as "daft". Danny\'s voice fades into a ghostly echo as he sadly says he wishes he could have gone to the party. Closing credits show a long list of real children who had died in actual farm accidents in the year before the film was made.'] ['In an attempt to bring a higher level of class and sophistication to VeggieTales, Archibald Asparagus requests and receives permission to run the show. The countertop is then modified with a faux fireplace and wing chair  and Archibald introduces the first segment. This segment was intended to be a VeggieTales production of the Shakespearean play Hamlet with the help of Phillipe and Jean-Claude, The French Peas. In the story, Omelet, played by Jimmy Gourd, is a prince of a kingdom in Denmark who desires some eggs "cooked light and fluffy" to eat. A baker brings them to him and informs Omelet that these are the last eggs in the kingdom. Regardless, Omelet feels happy about eating the eggs until Ophelia  asks him to instead share the eggs with the kingdom. However Omelet selfishly refuses. Later, Omelet joins a game of Battleship with a villager and is encouraged by him to share the eggs. As Omelet announces his plan to share, he learns that the town has plenty of eggs  and has light-and-fluffy eggs, or "omelettes", cooked for everybody. The segment ends with Larry and Junior in the audience bewildered by the antiquated English. Following this segment is the introduction to the usual "Silly Songs with Larry". Archibald intervenes and changes the segment to "Classy Songs with Larry". Opening with a bus stop scene similar to Forrest Gump and sung to the tune of Funiculi Funicula, Larry tells a growing group of bystanders ]] about his "high silk hat" and box of chocolates, while trying to keep his hat from being ruined or his chocolates from melting in the hot sun. Eventually Apollo Gourd comes and sits on Larry\'s hat and chocolate, much to his dismay. Finally, Archibald presents the "long lost musical of Gilbert and Sullivan," provided by The French Peas, entitled Lyle the Kindly Viking. In this segment, Junior Asparagus is a young boy named Lyle who quietly lives on an island with his fellow Vikings. As the Vikings return to the island with loot pillaged from a nearby monastery, Lyle slips out on his own ship and gives the monks his minuscule share of loot  as a small act of recompensation. One day, Lyle\'s trips are discovered by fellow Vikings Sven and Otar , who confront him, but Lyle convinces them that sharing is a much nicer alternative to pillaging and plundering. The next day, Lyle is discovered by the Viking leader Olaf , who unfortunately does not agree with Lyle\'s beliefs. When a great storm capsizes the Viking ships, the Monks manage to rescue Lyle. Lyle then convinces the Monks to save the rest of the doomed Vikings. This show of kindness convinces the Vikings to turn over a new leaf and share what they have rather than looting and pillaging from others. In the closing countertop sequence, Archibald discovers that his story was NOT written by Gilbert and Sullivan, as he had been told. Angry at being duped, Archibald chases the Peas off and the scene falls into chaos.'] ['Asuka, played by Anna Ishibashi, and her best childhood friend, Michi, played by Ayami Kakiuchi, are young girls who live in the fast, savvy city of Tokyo, where being fashionable is a not a social cliché, but a social requirement.

Coyote  and the Road Runner  are continuing their chase through the twisty roads of the desert. As Wile E. closes in on the Road Runner, a 4-way intersection is reached and the Road Runner takes a left turn. Wile E. looks back as he brakes himself into the dirt, not noticing a "DANGER BRIDGE OUT" sign, and thus falls off the edge of the plateau and busts a hole in the roads below. The Coyote walks out of the hole and plans his next scheme. 1. Thinking simple, the Coyote attempts to simply trip the Road Runner with a fake coyote foot , but only ends up getting the fake foot winded. As he walks out, he kneels on the leg and scratches his head, only for the leg to unreel itself, twisting his body in turn. 2. Wile E. broods in the dirt, and soon comes up with a new plan: Throw out a dynamite stick with a string. However, when Wile E. circles the string over his head, it lassos itself around the coyote\'s face before exploding. 3. Going for speed again, the Coyote then builds a contraption made from a fan, a sail, and roller skates to propel himself down the road. This works excellent in a straight line, but cannot follow the Road Runner around a tight curve. The poor Coyote is thrown into a pool, digs through a dirt beach, and slams directly into a wall. 4. Next, Wile E. holds onto a large firework and lights it as the Road Runner passes, hoping to give semi-aerial chase. However, the firework takes off without its owner, flaying the coyote\'s chest in the process, and then it hits a curve and reverses itself, also flaying Wile\'s pate and deeply annoying the devious coyote. 5. Devious doesn\'t apply to the next simple trap: Wile E. tries to pull a large boulder onto one end of a see-saw to launch himself towards the Road Runner on a high cliff, but the boulder squashes him instead. 6. Wile E. pushes an anvil tied to a balloon off an outcropping, and then pulls the string when he hears the Road Runner, trying to flatten his nemesis. The anvil and the Road Runner converge towards the same spot in the bridge the Road Runner is now on, but the Road Runner brakes just in time to avoid it. The anvil smashes through the bridge, is thrown back up through the hole by a power line, and drops towards the Coyote who is perched on the very edge of the outcropping. Shivering with fear, Wile E. covers his head, preparing for the impact. The anvil misses him, but instead breaks through another part of the outcropping. The Coyote sighs with relief, but soon spots he is defying gravity and is then subject to it! 7. Again attempting to give semi-aerial chase, the Coyote retracts a massive spring attached to a wall and sits in it, tentatively letting go of his grip on the ground as the Road Runner passes on the left. But instead of launching at the bird, he simply gets caught inside the spring as it extends itself outwards. 8. Another ACME product  takes the scene. Wile E. picks up one of them, hydrates it, and attempts to throw it off the cliff towards the Road Runner below, but instead, the boulder expands first and crushes him. 9. In a final attempt to outrun and flatten the Road Runner, the Coyote constructs an outboard steam roller. When he turns it on, it rolls away from him and down the road. The steam roller soon encounters the Road Runner, who reverses direction and runs away. Wile E. continues to chase after his creation, while in what appears to be a convenient Deus ex machina, a fork comes up ahead with a sign stating: In case of steam roller use Detour. The Road Runner takes the detour and zooms into a miniature "escape tunnel", which was actually a cannon trap, with the coyote in hot pursuit. Wile E. leaps behind the cannon, lights the fuse and sits down, tired but satisfied. The fuse smokes, but the cannon doesn\'t fire. Confused, Wile E. looks inside the cannon and sees a white light coming out, accompanied by railroad signs. Seeing no danger, he laughs and looks inside again, but the cannon fires, with the Road Runner riding on top of the cannonball. The Road Runner waves at the now injured Coyote as he walks away, only for his own steamroller to come rolling towards him. Wile E. holds up a sign saying: "This is the end" just as the steamroller flattens him. The End.'] ['Dr. Stanislaus Pyckle, , successfully separates the good and evil of man\'s nature with the use of a powerful drug . Transforming into the personality of Mr. Pride , he terrorizes the town with unspeakable acts including stealing a boy’s ice cream, cheating at marbles, and popping a bag behind a lady pedestrian. The towns people track him down where Mr. Pride locks himself in the laboratory and transforms back at Dr. Pyckle. The doctor assures the townspeople that he hasn\'t seen the "fiend" they were after. While he talks, the drug used for the transformation spills in the plate of food of the doctor\'s dog. Dr. Pyckle confronts the fiendish dog when he locks the door and the townspeople leave. But once again, Mr. Pride emerges and brings havoc to the town, and again is chased down by the townspeople. He enters the lab and transforms back into Pyckle, and again assures the townspeople he hasn\'t seen the fiend. His assistant  begs the doctor to open and comfort him, but he transforms back into Mr. Pride. He opens the door to the assistant and locks it again. She screams seeing Pride and the townspeople hurry back, before the assistant can knock Pride down. The appearance of the fiendish Mr. Pride is an obvious spoof on the make-up designed for John Barrymore as Mr. Hyde. Also spoofed are the sudden and strange movements Barrymore\'s Jekyll makes during the transformation, as well as Hyde\'s confrontation with Millicent, Jekyll\'s fiancee, when Hyde lets her inside the lab. Other scenes show obvious parodies of other Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde films (e.g. Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and [[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde .'] ["The interactive film first requests that viewers temporarily allow the application access to their Facebook account, and then incorporates information gleaned from the viewer's Facebook page to fill in details of the film itself.

Their father seems to be long gone, though Wheezer tearfully observes that since he said he\'d come back for them, "I know he will." The two-tier class system among the humans in the house is reflected by its canine residents: Spud\'s posh police dog Nero is described by mom as "a pedigreed animal" and has the run of the house, while Wheezer\'s dog Pete "is nothing but an alley dog" and is banned from entry. A typical day begins with Pete coming into Wheezer\'s bedroom through an open window, and Sherwood wastes no time telling on Wheezer, who promptly gets a spanking from six-foot-two-inch Payson. She threatens to send Pete to the pound next time he is found in the house. Wheezer then pops Spud in the face and Spud screams and cries for his "mama-mama-mama." This brings a second barrage of spanking and the threat to throw him and Dorothy into an orphanage if their "good for nothing" father does not show up soon. It also brings tender comfort for Wheezer from Dorothy and Pete, whose close-up reveals big lush tears rolling down his concerned snout. Payson then leaves to go downtown and tells Wheezer to not let Sherwood get dirty. Outside, we pick up Stymie stopping at Pete\'s doghouse for a chat about how hungry they both are. Stymie wistfully rhapsodizes about the spread he\'d put together for both of them, and we cut back repeatedly to Pete, whose mouth is watering at the mention of all the fine food. Stymie arrives at the kitchen door, where Wheezer and Dorothy have only mush to eat while Spud and Nero enjoy ham and eggs. Spurred by the aromas of the kitchen, Symie runs a con job on Spud, telling him that ham and eggs can talk: "I heard \'em talkin\' this mornin\'." To disprove it, skeptical Spud cooks up a heapin\' frying pan of ham and eggs, then loses interest and goes outside when the egg-to-ham dialogue fails to materialize. Stymie, Wheezer and Dorothy dig in and enjoy the feast. Spud, squatting by the edge of a well, is pushed in — by his own dog. He sends Dickie to get Wheezer. Wheezer and Stymie, stretching and in no great hurry, stroll out "to see what the trouble is." They get Spud a rope after teasing him a little while. As they pull him up from the well, he states that he\'ll be "telling mother about this." Wheezer drops the rope and Spud plunges back in. Then as he pulls him out again, Spud swears he will keep this a secret — until Spud gets his feet on the ground and says "I am too gonna tell Mama!" Wheezer states that the dunking Spud got will be worth the whipping he\'ll get. Later, Spud goes to a neighbor\'s barn and finds that Nero has killed another chicken. He tells the owner, Mr. Brown , that Pete killed the bird. Mr. Brown then tries to shoot Pete, but Wheezer, Dorothy, and finally a policeman , stop him. Nevertheless, Pete is sent to the pound because he is unlicensed. At the pound, Wheezer gazes at Pete through the fence and cries until a kind lady  asks what\'s the matter. Turns out she is his auntie  and she gives him the two dollars to spring Petey from the slam. She then tells Wheezer and Dorothy that their "daddy has been very, very sick" and she would be taking them to live with her in a nice place. As she takes the gussied-up Wheezer, Dorothy and Pete to the chauffered car with all their belongings, the mean stepmother gripes that their father was no good anyway and she was fed up with taking care of the children. The stepmother bends over to straighten the carpet and the aunt comes back to give her a swift kick in the backside. The film closes when Wheezer says to Dorothy that "I sure hate to leave my old pal Stymie," but the final shot reveals Stymie — in a brand new suit of his own — riding comfortably in the spare tire.'] ['Blood will tell is a sci-fi horror film set in 16th Century Holland.

Attendees are asked to don their "safety goggles" in preparation for the scientific demonstrations. The show opens with the crew of the show searching for Wayne, when he suddenly flies on stage miniaturized and in a transportation device called a Hoverpod. He accidentally drops the control box and sends the machine flying off behind the stage out of control. The Hoverpod comes back and shorts out the neon Imagination Institute "Inventor of the Year Award" sign over the audience . Wayne\'s son Nick demonstrates some of his father\'s other inventions to kill time while the crew searches for him. He puts a mouse in his father\'s copy machine and they quickly multiply . This does not go smoothly, and the audience ends up screaming with the loose mice running under their seats and a holographic "Holo-Pet" lion in their faces used to scare the mice away . While the demonstrations go awry, Wayne manages to use his shrinking machine to return himself back to normal size. He brings out the machine to demonstrate its uses by shrinking a family\'s luggage, saving space and money when traveling. Unfortunately, the machine goes out of control and shrinks the audience . The viewers are antagonized by obstacles such as Wayne\'s youngest son Adam taking a picture of them with a blinding flash and picking up the theater to "show the little people to Mommy."  Then Nick\'s python Gigabyte, much larger than the miniature audience, nearly eats them, as he had not yet been fed that day. Quark, the Szalinski\'s dog, then chases him away with a few barks. Other elements in the show involve a cloning machine that clones thousands copies of white lab mice and they get loose in the audience. When Wayne\'s wife gets there, she faints upon seeing the tiny people and her hand becomes stretched-out and giantic. One last remaining factor is that there is an orange cat that\'s brought in to kill all of the mice and upon fixing the machine Professor Szalinski makes a big mistake and transforms the cat into a very fearsome full grown-male lion and after a second it roars loudly out into the crowd. Luckily, Wayne fixes the machine just in the nick of time and returns the audience back to normal size and the lion back into an ordinary cat, but Quark is momentarily affected by the beam and then runs backstage out of sight. His wife recovers and Wayne accepts his award and begins his speech, but he is interrupted by Nick warning of a "big, humongous problem." The now giant Quark walks out onto the stage and the curtain closes while viewers hear the Imagination Institute\'s crew trying to stop him from crushing the place. He then finds his way through the curtain and sneezes on the audience for the finale. As they leave, they can hear the commotion from backstage continue.'] ['The cartoon opens as a camera pans across the continent of Africa where the narrator describes how dark and terrifying it is, amid jungle sounds and roars.

Dolan, he says the film is about a "young wiseguy, assassin, gets betrayed by his people. They whack him, leave his body parts in dumpsters all around the city. Long story short, he is put back together, by science...or maybe it\'s supernatural. And he gets payback on everyone who fucked him over, including the cunt he was engaged to. She was getting porked by his boss the night the hero was killed." Several episodes in the film are drawn from Moltisanti\'s own life experiences as a made man in the Soprano Crime Family, including a misinterpreted and overblown rumor concerning a potential affair between Family head Anthony Soprano and Christopher\'s then-fiance Adriana La Cerva. The film closes on a tight-shot of a crucifix and a cornicello, juxtaposing "the sacred and the profane"'] ['The Night Pastor, a Jesus blending, prevails in the city by force of law and order!

When the camera zooms in on Bugs\' rabbit hole, he pokes up out of his hole, dressed in a nightshirt and holding up a candle, and tells the audience, "Did you ever have the feeling you was being watched?" He is, via remote TV, as an evil scientist  is planning to catch a rabbit to provide dinner for his large, hairy, orange, sneaker-wearing monster, named Gossamer. The scientist lures Bugs to his castle via a shapely robotic female rabbit, complete with a large wind-up key in the back, and accompanied by Oh, You Beautiful Doll in the cartoon\'s underscore. Once Bugs gets to the castle  the evil scientist locks the door behind him. Bugs looks at him and says, "You don\'t need to lock that door, mac. I don\'t wanna leave." Then he clicks his tongue and raises his eyebrows at the audience and begins kissing the mechanical rabbit on the hand, the robot short-circuits and breaks into pieces. Bugs faces the audience and says, "That\'s the trouble with some dames... kiss \'em and they fly apart!" Nonchalantly shrugging off this odd encounter, Bugs heads for the door, but the scientist persuades him to stay and meet another "little friend". When it becomes clear that this "friend" is a ferocious beast, Bugs sizes up the situation, vigorously shakes the scientist\'s hand "Goodbye!" and launches into a schtick where he packs luggage for a vacation trip, accompanied by a very brassy rendition of California, Here I Come. Just before bolting for the door, he tells the scientist, in typical Groucho Marx-ist fashion, "And don\'t think it hasn\'t been a little slice of heaven...\'cause it hasn\'t." The scientist then releases Gossamer. This is the last scene with the scientist, as the rest of the cartoon is an extended chase between Bugs and Gossamer, with gags aplenty. At one point, as Bugs is behind a door and Gossamer is trying to break through, a desperate-sounding Bugs cries out, "Is there a doctor in the house?" A silhouette, seemingly from the theater audience, stands up and offers, "I\'m a doctor." Bugs suddenly relaxes, grins, starts munching a carrot, and asks, "What\'s up, Doc?", just before Gossamer breaks through and the chase resumes.  Bugs Bunny and Gossamer pass by a mirror; Gossamer looks at the mirror, then his reflection runs away toward the door screaming in horror; Gossamer looks at the audience and shrugs. Bugs rushes up a staircase, but rushes back down and knocks down Gossamer, telling him he can\'t go up there because it\'s dark . Bugs acts as a lamp; he dances to the tune of Shuffle Off To Buffalo and taunts Gossamer by calling "Hey, Frankenstein!". Bugs and Gossamer keep running until a door on the floor opens and a rock falls into the empty space. While Bugs is tiptoeing backwards and praying, he bumps into Gossamer. He comes up with an idea and gives him a manicure. He starts talking and acting like a girl and says, "Oh, for shame! Just look at those fingernails!  My, I\'ll bet you monsters lead in-teresting lives. I said to my girl friend just the other day, \'Gee, I\'ll bet monsters are in-teresting.\' I said. The places you must go and the things you must see -- my stars! I bet you meet lots of in-teresting people too. I\'m always in-terested in meeting in-teresting people. Now let\'s dip our patties in the water!" He puts the monster\'s fingers into the water to have his fingernails cut, but it contains two mousetraps. The monster yelps in pain, and then sobs. Bugs twice thinks he has escaped. The first time, the monster is hiding behind a picture frame and Bugs apparently is not aware until he wises up and pokes Gossamer in the eyes. Gossamer gets out from behind the wall, and while looking for Bugs, finds him in a painting. Gossamer then gets the idea to poke Bugs in the eyes too, but before he can fully carry it out, Bugs jumps the gun and pokes Gossamer in the eyes again, and disappears from the painting, making Gossamer go behind the wall again. The second time, Gossamer is following Bugs behind the wall  until Bugs marks where he previously was and smashes the mark with a giant mallet when Gossamer appears behind it. The wall crumbles and a barely conscious Gossamer quickly follows. The third time, Gossamer is in a knight\'s armor, holding an axe above his head. He gets hit by Bugs Bunny in his locomotive-style knight-riding horse, causing him to hit the wall to turn into a can labeled "Canned Monster". However, as Bugs saunters off toward the exit, singing to himself, Gossamer gets the bunny in his clutches. Bugs repeats his opening line, "Did you ever have the feeling you were being watched?", and Gossamer\'s expression changes from anger to anxiety. Bugs points to the audience. Gossamer  shrieks, "PEOPLE!" and runs away screaming, breaking through a series of walls, leaving his cartoon outline in all of them. Having "re-re-disposed of the monster", Bugs is about to "exit stage right" , when the female robo-rabbit re-appears, intact, and again accompanied by Oh, You Beautiful Doll. Bugs snickers, "Mechanical!" Then the robot smooches him on the cheek, leaving a lipstick mark on the smitten bunny, who says, "Well, so it\'s mechanical!" He assumes a robot-like gait  and follows her off the screen.'] ['{{Plot}} Mammy Two Shoes  is sweeping the floor and Tom relaxing near Jerry\'s mouse hole. Tom raises his feet to let Mammy sweep under him, while Jerry is undisturbed as he comes out of his mouse hole and returns with a piece of cheese. As the mouse returns home, Mammy points him out to Tom, but the cat takes simply one glance before returning to sleep. The mailman rings the doorbell. She eagerly goes to answer the door, and receives a package. Mammy has been expecting this particular package, as she opens it to reveal Mechano, a talented robotic cat. Mammy calls Tom over to show him Mechano, using this as an official opportunity to downsize him after his laziness. In disbelief, both Tom and Jerry laugh out loud. To silence the cat, Mammy then turns on Mechano with the remote control, and it immediately darts to the mouse, hits him with a hammer, and slingshots him out through the window. Mammy then laughs, while, the sad, helpless and unwanted cat packs up and leaves the house. Mammy prides the "new-fangled" piece of machinery on its job and, as she flounces triumphantly out of the room. Jerry tries to get back into his hole in defiance, using various disguises to elude the computerized cat. First, the mouse sneaks through the mail slot with a letter for cover, but Mechano is still able to detect him. Jerry outruns him all the way to his hole, but Mechano hits him with a tennis racquet just in time. The machine hits Jerry again to bounce him into the air and then lobs him out through the window. Next, Jerry tries to sneak in through a garden hose, but Mechano chops the hose with an ax just in front of the mouse. Jerry tries to inconspicuously slip backwards through the hose and is cut off in that direction as well. Mechano continues to chop at the hose as Jerry turns around again, and Jerry is only left with a small section of hose such that he crawls like a worm. The mouse tries to crawl underneath the door slot and only does so in time to avoid getting chopped in half. To avoid being so conspicuous, Jerry slingshots himself from the front yard towards his mouse hole, but Mechano catches him with a baseball glove. The mechno-cat then loads Jerry into a cannon and uses the mouse\'s tail as a fuse, who is shot out of the window. Knowing he cannot win by himself, Jerry inserts a series of clockwork mice under the door slot to create a diversion army for Mechano. Everything quickly goes as planned: Mechano starts to attack the mice and the house as soon as it detects them. The machine chops up the piano with an axe, breaks the china with his cannon, saws a table with a buzzsaw, and launches dynamite into a mouse hole causing serious wreckage to the house. Mammy hears all of this, sees Mechano chopping into the floor after one of the mice, and yells at Mechano to stop. However, the computer will only respond to the controller, so nothing happens. Mammy runs around screaming for Tom\'s help and is quickly heard by him. Mammy runs away from the assault as Mechano tries to break through wardrobes and doors to chase the "mice" and ends up breaking himself to pieces. Mechano\'s computer hub, unfortunately, gets accidentally swallowed by Tom just before the maid reaches him. Mammy, with great relief, welcomes the cat back into the house, grateful to have him back on mouse-catching duties. However, Jerry gets the last laugh when he turns Mechano\'s remote control on, causing Tom to transform into Mechano! The terrified housemaid watches helplessly and starts screaming as the mechanixed Tom activates and goes on a path of destruction.'] ["Traffic jams, commercial saturation and garbage form part of Dakar's daily life.

The monologue is about getting into a fight with another man in a restaurant for looking at his girlfriend. The anecdote ends with Mike saying that he discovered the man was a homosexual, so he beat up his girlfriend instead, and is surprised that she doesn't call him anymore. The camera shifts to reveal that Mike is at an audition for an Italian role. The casting director expresses interest and has Mike speak Italian before telling him they’ll get back to him. When the director asks Mike where the monologue came from, Mike says that it’s a true story that happened to a friend of his. Outside, Mike gets on a payphone and calls his manager without an Italian accent. He complains about the monologue , saying it was offensive and he worries that it will keep him from getting the job. Mike wipes the tattoo off his arm and goes on to his next audition. At an audition for a commercial, Mike meets a fellow black actor in the waiting room and the two of them talk about their careers. Mike tells the other actor about the audition he just left, and again complains that he thought his monologue was offensive. The black actor tells Mike he has just landed a role in an international commercial, but Mike says he doesn’t want to do commercials because no great actors have had to do commercials. Before he can audition, the director tells Mike that he’s “a little too light” and not to bother auditioning. He suggests Mike audition for a Spanish role in a soap instead. Mike goes to another audition and reads a Cuban accent with a Hispanic actress. The two of them are portraying an argument, but when the actress launches into Spanish, Mike is unable to continue. As they’re leaving the audition, the actress guesses correctly that Mike doesn’t speak Spanish. She suggests Mike try out for a soap that’s casting Hispanic actors, but Mike says he doesn’t want to do soaps because no great actors have ever done them. Mike attends another audition, where the woman reading with him tells him that she really thinks he could do well. Mike does the reading with her in a heavy urban accent, but the casting directors cut the audition short, saying they’re looking for more of a “Wesley-Type” . Mike moves on to another audition, where they are expecting him from a previous audition. The casting director sees on his resume that Mike does rap and Mike launches into a hip-hop routine. Afterwards, Mike sits down and does a monologue about being a young man watching his father on stage in a performance of Raisin in the Sun. During his father’s performance, Mike came to believe that his father wanted him to be a great Black actor. Later, after his father died, Mike realized that his father wanted him to be more than just a Black actor. He wanted his son to be just an actor. When the monologue is finished, the casting director is impressed with Mike’s performance, but admits that they are supposed to be casting an actor with long hair like dreadlocks. Mike leaves with a promise that they will contact him if they can cast him instead. The film cuts to Mike sitting silently and angrily at a booth in a diner. He can overhear an actress talking to another man about how frustrated she is to be typecast as a blonde bimbo. When the waitress comes, the actress orders coffee that's “not too light, not too dark.” The film ends with Mike chuckling to himself and mouthing the words “not too light, not too dark.”"] ["Luc  spends his holiday at the sea with his slightly older and decidedly more effeminate boyfriend Sébastien .

The baggy-eyed rodent crawls out of bed, climbs the steps to the beacon, and yanks the plug out of the outlet to turn it off. Polly the parrot immediately flies into the lightkeeper’s bedroom squawking “Lights out! Lights out!” The lightkeeper wakes up shouting, “Grrrreat Scott! It’s that crrrrazy moose  again!” Consequently, a cargo carrier named Australia crashes into the rocks on the shore of the island, causing several wooden crates to spill overboard. The frustrated captain admonishes the lightkeeper to keep the beacon lit, and the lightkeeper and Polly apologize for the mishap. Hippety Hopper, a baby kangaroo intended for delivery to a city zoo, is inside one of the fallen crates, and after the ship departs, he hops off within the crate until it breaks apart against the rocks, setting him free. While all this is going on, Sylvester is downstairs sleeping. The lightkeeper abruptly wakes him up, rebuking, “While you sleep, that crrrrazy moose is loose in the hoose!” , then orders him to go upstairs to catch him and to "Hurrrry up, now, hurrrry up, now" . Sylvester tells Polly he can catch the mouse in a matter of seconds, and Polly starts counting the seconds. Hippety then hops into the lighthouse and follows Sylvester up the stairs. Sylvester sets a mousetrap and attaches a string. When he hears a snap, he pulls on the string and sees he has caught Hippety, whom he thinks is a giant mouse, which makes his jaw drop to the floor. Sylvester then shoots like a bullet down the stairs as Polly keeps counting , and dashes to the bathroom, thinking he must have “lighthouse eyes” or “stigmatism”. He puts in eyedrops, then, grabbing a bottle of vitamins, gulps them down and showers himself with them. Meanwhile, the mouse frees Hippety from the trap, and Hippety returns the favor by pulling the plug out of the wall.  Sylvester runs out of the bathroom, tells Polly “Keep counting, buster” , runs upstairs, puts the plug back in and pounds a few nails over it to prevent Hippety and the mouse from pulling it out again. He then prepares to knock Hippety out with a club and swings at him when he sees Hippety’s shadow approaching, but misses and sees that it is only the mouse wielding a mallet, which he uses to slam Sylvester’s foot. The mouse then zips behind the elevator door. Sylvester pounds on the door, and Hippety kicks him into the wall. Sylvester then sees Hippety and the mouse behind the door playing a back-and-forth switcheroo, making him think he must be hallucinating. Sylvester then charges back toward the elevator and Sylvester, Hippety and the mouse get into a scuffle, which ends with Hippety sending Sylvester tumbling down the stairs. By this time, Polly has counted more than 70,000 seconds , but the punch-drunk feline goes back for more, assuring Polly he will get the mouse “quicker than you can count up to Jack Robinson”. The mouse cuts the extension cord in two places with a pair of scissors, putting the lights out again, and the furious lightkeeper stalks Sylvester with a club threatening to “fix that good-fer-nothin’ pussycat”. In a panic, Sylvester attempts to reconnect the cord and gets a massive electric jolt, which turns the lights back on  and spares him a beating...for the moment. As Sylvester tapes the cord back together, the mouse rigs dynamite with the cord wrapped around it. It explodes, completely destroying the cord beyond any chance of repair. Immediately, the lightkeeper runs up the stairs and pummels Sylvester with the club. In the final scene, the lightkeeper is sleeping soundly, as are Hippety and the mouse, while Sylvester is serving as the beacon, hooked up to a battery with the light projecting through his eyes. To this, he laments, “I never thought just being a pussycat could be so complicated!”'] ['As he has in previous cartoons, Bugs is traveling underground, only this time he winds up in France at the headquarters of Napoleon Bonaparte, aptly called Headquartiers du Napoleon. Napoleon is shown planning a military offensive and gets into an argument with Bugs over where the artillery should be placed. When Bugs agrees with his original idea Napoleon angrily places it where Bugs said it should go and takes snuff. Bugs takes some as well, but sneezes on the plans, knocking the models over. Napoleon thinks Bugs is a saboteur, and sends a guard after him. Bugs easily outwits the incompetent guard  and causes him to hit Napoleon with a bayonet. Mugsy then gets the "point" of the bayonet from Napoleon offscreen-and goes howling in to the air. Bugs then disguises himself as Josephine and asks Napoleon to dance. Napoleon sees Bugs\' tail through the disguise and chases Bugs, who slides down a staircase. The guard sees Bugs and points his bayonet, intending to stab Bugs as he slides down. Bugs hops off of the staircase and Napoleon is stabbed instead offscreen-he comes back up the staircase screaming in pain. Mugsy then gets the "point" again. Napoleon ends up catching Bugs by holding him at gunpoint and orders him into a guillotine. Bugs runs off with Napoleon in pursuit, running down the guillotine platform and then back up and through the guillotine which is still raised. Napoleon follows Bugs but as he runs through the guillotine the blade falls and slices the back of his uniform along with the hair from the back of his head. Napoleon demands an explanation from the hooded executioner, who is revealed to be Bugs himself. Bugs then tries to elude Napoleon by hiding in a cannon, but is found when Mugsy is ordered to sound the alarm and fires the cannon. Napoleon resumes his chase of Bugs, but two men in white coats show up and one says to the other: "Hey Pierre, here\'s another Napoleon", and Pierre replies: "that\'s the twelfth one today." "But I am Napoleon", the little Commander wails as he\'s dragged away by them to the nearest insane asylum or "maison d\'idiot . Napoleon screams and threatens the men in white coats with death: "I will have you executed for this!!!" Bugs then looks at the camera and says: "Imagine that guy thinking he\'s Napoleon...[quickly donning a Napoleon hat] when I really am!". He pulls out a flute, playing "La Marseillaise", which becomes "Yankee Doodle" as he marches into the distance.'] ['At a meeting of astronomers, their president proposes a trip to the Moon. After addressing some dissent, six brave astronomers agree to the plan. They build a space capsule in the shape of a bullet, and a huge cannon to shoot it into space. The astronomers embark and their capsule is fired from the cannon with the help of "marines", most of whom are portrayed as a bevy of beautiful women in sailors\' outfits, while the rest are men. The Man in the Moon watches the capsule as it approaches, and it hits him in the eye. At this point, a Selenite  appears, but it is killed easily by an astronomer, as the creatures explode if they are hit with a hard force. More Selenites appear and it becomes increasingly difficult for the astronomers to destroy them as they are surrounded. The Selenites arrest the astronomers and bring them to their commander at the Selenite palace. An astronomer lifts the Chief Selenite off his throne and dashes him to the ground, exploding him.  The final sequence depicts a celebratory parade in honor of the travelers\' return, including the unveiling of a commemorative statue. This ending sequence was considered lost until 2002, when a well preserved complete print was discovered at a barn in France. The extended version was screened at the Pordenone Silent Film Festival in 2003, and the sequence was included and restored in full for the 2012 Blu-Ray edition of the film.'] ['It is winter once again in the Evergreen Forest, home of the frozen Evergreen lake, where everyone in the forest goes to ice skate and play hockey.

Cedrc Sneer is also at the rink, too, where he meets Sophia Tutu, a female aardvark figure skater who takes an interest in Cedric. Meanwhile, Cyril Sneer has plans for Evergreen Lake - he plans on building his \'Cyril Dome\' over the entire lake. But as Cyril and his construction crew are ready to build, the Raccoons and their friends stop them in their tracks and try to defend their lake. Bert then steps in and proposes that the two warring sides should play a hockey game to determine who gets the lake. Before Bert\'s friends try to stop him, Bert and Cyril seal the deal. While Cyril trains his Bears for the game, the Raccoons ask Cedric to play on their side. Cedric agrees, as long as he can get away from his father, who disapproves of Cedric\'s friendship with the Raccoons. As they train, Cedric is shown to be a great hockey player and the team feel like they have a good chance against Cyril\'s team, but Cyril goes to spy on the Raccoons and he is immediately not happy with his son siding with the Raccoons. He grounds Cedric for a month and he also forbids Cedric from seeing Sophia  ever again. Despite the setback, the Raccoons and Schaeffer continue to practice. On the night before the game, the friends decide to sneak into Cyril Sneer\'s mansion to ask Cedric if he will play alongside them. However, Cedric is more concerned for their safety and warns them of what could happen if Cyril finds them. A moment later, they are almost caught by Cyril, who claims he can hear other voices and angrily threatens his son not to go anywhere near the Raccoons again. Because of this, Cedric becomes too scared and the friends leave without his backing. On the night of the game, Cyril\'s Bears are pummelling the Raccoons team by 3-0. After Bert injures his hand, Sophia finally goes up to Cedric, who has been dragged along to watch the game, and convinces him to help out. Masquerading as a "mystery player", Cedric manages to tie the game 3-3. Cyril finds out who the mystery player is, literally kicking his own son off the ice and threatening to lock him in the dungeon as a punishment. The team considers giving up, but despite his injury, Bert refuses to give up so easily. The rest of the team are spurred on by Bert\'s courage and they go back onto the ice to continue. Bert manages to win the game for the team in the last few seconds, thus saving Evergreen Lake from Cyril\'s greed. The next day, Julie, Tommy and their father arrive at the lake and find skate marks from the game. They\'re utterly puzzled as to who left them, as the humans were never aware of the threat posed to the lake, leaving Dan to curiously ask the kids if they\'ve "been playing any wild hockey games" lately.'] ['A newspaper shows Porky traveling to Africa to hunt the rare do-do bird, worth four trillion dollars. Porky uses his airplane to go to Dark Africa, then Darker Africa, and finally lands in Darkest Africa. When Porky lands, a sign tells him that he\'s in Wackyland , while a voice booms out "It can happen here!" Porky tiptoes along the ground in his airplane and he is greeted by a roaring beast, who suddenly becomes effeminate and dances away into the forest. He watches as  the sun is lifted above the horizon by a tower of stacked creatures. Nearby, another creature rises out of a tall flower, playing "The William Tell Overture", using his nose as a flute. The creature launches into a wild drum solo, which brings out many strange, weird, and oafish creatures, including a rabbit dangling in midair from a swing that seems to be threaded through its own ears, and an angry criminal imprisoned behind a free-floating barred window that he holds in his hands. As Porky tries to find the do-do, he is distracted by a duck singing "Mammy!", a horn-headed creature, and a conjoined cat and dog hybrid creature spinning around like a tornado. Finally, the do-do appears. Porky tries to catch it, but it plays tricks on him. The do-do pulls out a pencil and draws a door in mid-air, and instead of opening it and running through, reaches down and lifts up the bottom edge of the door like a curtain, darts underneath and lets it snap back into place for Porky to bump into. At another point, the do-do appears on the Warner Brothers shield logo and slingshots Porky into the ground. Porky is defeated when the do-do pulls a wall of bricks in the picture and lets him crash into it. At the end of the film, Porky triumphs when he disguises himself as a bearded paperboy, shouting "Extra! Extra! Porky captures do-do!", before hitting the bird with a mallet. Porky loudly proclaims that he has captured the last do-do. The do-do mockingly replies, "Yes, I\'m really the last of the do-dos. Ain\'t I, fellas?". A multitude of do-dos appear, all agreeing. They howl, which allows the do-do to escape and stand on Porky\'s head.'] ["The film starts with a brief reprise of the previous film, before cutting to the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios in Culver City, California where assistant cameraman Bill Reilly picks up the film from the lab for Marie Antoinette  which he passes on to cameraman William H.

Meanwhile Mickey, now cleaning inside the clock, comes across a sleeping stork which he tries unsuccessfully to remove. Mickey is left hanging on a rope outside the tower. Back inside, Donald is getting the mainspring back into place with a mallet, but he struggles to get the very last piece in place. Donald gets furious at the spring and asks "What\'s the big idea?" The spring seems to respond with an echo of Donald\'s question. Donald gets into an argument with the spring, but it knocks him off. Donald get\'s his head stuck in a gear on the balance wheel shaft. When he finally is free from it, the oscillation makes his body continue to move. Now outside, Goofy (singing "[[Asleep in the Deep  is cleaning the outside bell. While he is cleaning the interior of the bell, it becomes 4:00 pm, causing two mechanical statues to come from inside the tower and ring the bell four times. The first figure, resembling Father Time, startles Goofy, but when he looks out he sees no one and continues cleaning. The second figure, representing Lady Liberty, rings the bell from the other side. After the third ring, Goofy is determined to be ready for the next time. He is ready to attack, but when he sees Lady Liberty, he chivalrously apologizes. But Goofy is standing between her torch and the bell, and gets a big knock to the head. This puts Goofy in a dizzy lovestruck stupor for the rest of the film. Mickey is alarmed when he sees Goofy almost fall and tries to save him. At each turn Mickey is just barely able to save Goofy. At last the two of them fly through a window, land on the mainspring which Donald has finally managed to put back together, then all three land in the same gear in which Donald was stuck earlier.'] ['Opening his own detective agency, Alfalfa dons a deerstalker cap and rechristens himself "X-10, Sooper Sleuth."

The film starts with Father Christmas coming back from his annual Christmas Eve run, and relaxing in his home with his cat and dog. He then breaks the fourth wall, explaining that his unwinding is well deserved, contrary to popular belief. He cites the care of his reindeer, his garden, and shopping among others as activities that take up his time. Because of his strenuous lifestyle, he explains that in the past year he decided to take a holiday. In a flashback, it is shown that after bringing home brochures, and audibly considering Italy, Greece, Ireland, Holland, Canada, Germany, Tunisia, Switzerland, he finally settled on France. However, when he imagines all of the things he\'ll be able to do there , he decides on the need for a camper van.

After pondering, he decides on Scotland because of the purity of its water. Unfazed by the rain, he goes to a bar. The following morning, he finds the weather considerably better, and he takes a swim in the nearby lake. The water is very cold, as well as shark infested. "Time to move on" again, and he picks Las Vegas as his next stop because it is well-known to be warm and dry, two things that were untrue during his stay Scotland. He stays at Nero\'s Palace, a spoof of Caesars Palace. He stays there for over a month, enjoying the casino, pool, room service, entertainment, golf courses, and cuisine extensively. After a kid suspects that he is Father Christmas, he packs up and goes home, but not before paying the large hotel bill. He comes back to an overgrown garden, and after he picks up his dog and cat, he finds a pile of letters inside his door that for a short time bars his entrance. He starts sifting through them, commenting on all of the different names that children call him. Shortly thereafter, a postman delivers more bags of post. There is more looking at letters amongst daily activities, and then a truck comes and dumps an entire load of post on the ground.

After dreaming of relaxing in a pool surrounded by women back in Vegas, his alarm goes off and he gets ready to go out.  He then makes his rounds delivering presents, with a snack break in the middle. There is a thunderstorm, fog, and of course heavy snow that he has to deal with.

Tweety yearns dearly to fly freely like other birds, but not allowed to do so by Granny. That is considering his safety, as Sylvester is always lurking around waiting for a chance. Granny reads a newspaper advertisement by Jet Age Technology who has invented a $12.95 Flying Bird-Cage, which would allow birds fly safely. Granny, who understands Tweety\'s longing for freedom, decides to buy the cage and presents it to Tweety. This enables Tweety to fly around outdoors without leaving the security of his cage. Sylvester is at first taken aback at the sight of Tweety flying safely, piloting the jet-powered cage like an airplane. Two crows also watch in awe . Sylvester resolves to ground Tweety\'s cage and get his round-headed meal; his eyes rolling around to follow his every move.  Each of the following attempts are in vain: * An attempt to snare the cage with a butterfly catcher’s net. The jet-powered cage is strong enough to drag the butterfly net, along with the cat hanging to it—until he crashes into a light pole. * After Tweety coming in for flying instructions , hiding inside the cage. Tweety eventually senses he\'s in trouble and releases the "bombs" while in mid-air, just before Sylvester is about to strike. * Use of a rocket bomb to intercept the flying object of interest. The bomb simply flies back at the cat. * A horseshoe-shaped magnet tied to a fishing rod. While the cage momentarily struggles against the magnet\'s pull , Tweety manages to get the cage to break free. Sylvester is dragged into downtown traffic and crashes into a bus. * Sylvester using large flaps to fly beside Tweety. Sylvester gloats, mocking the bird for thinking he outsmarted him, but Tweety points out that Sylvester has his hands full. The cat tosses the flaps aside and shoots back, "Well now I haven\'t!" ... just before he realizes he\'s in for a big fall! At the end, Sylvester—limping on crutches with all the bandages on—decides to joins the U.S. Air Force, vowing to earn his wings and get Tweety once and for all. Throughout the cartoon, the sound effects for the jet cage\'s engines are more appropriate to a propeller-driven aircraft, and so is the terminology Tweety uses when he reads alout from the pilot\'s manual.'] ["Made in black-and-white with a running time of just under 50 minutes, The War Game depicts the prelude to and the immediate weeks of the aftermath to a Soviet nuclear attack against Britain. A Chinese invasion of South Vietnam starts the war; tensions escalate when the United States authorises tactical nuclear warfare against the Chinese. Although the Soviet and East German forces threaten to invade West Berlin if the U.S. does not withdraw that decision, the U.S. does not acquiesce to Communist demands and occupies West Berlin; two U.S. Army divisions attempt to fight their way into Berlin, but the Russian and East German forces defeat them in battle. The U.S. President launches a pre-emptive, NATO tactical nuclear attack. A limited nuclear war erupts between the West and the East; missiles strike Britain. The chaos of the prelude to the attack, as city residents are forcibly evacuated to the country, leads to the story's centre in Rochester, which is struck by an off-target missile aimed at Gatwick Airport. Key targets in Kent are RAF Manston and the Maidstone barracks, which are mentioned in scenes showing immediate effects of the attack. The results of that missile's explosion are the instant blinding of those who see the explosion, the resultant firestorm caused by the heat wave, and the blast front; later, the collapse of society, because of radiation sickness, psychological damage, and destroyed infrastructure; the British Army burns corpses, while police shoot looters during food riots."] ["Betty wakes up after the morning after her birthday party.

Soon, though, he comes to realize that things aren\'t always what they appear to be. With its bold art direction, stark but stylish depiction of the frozen Russian landscape, and inspired computer animation, "Glago\'s Guest" is an exciting, entertaining, and original short film that uses the medium to full advantage.'] ["Nobita and Doraemon travel to the future to see whether Nobita will marry Shizuka.

His depression and aggravation only get exacerbated by the goings-on in the neighborhood. Though his mailbox is empty, he tries sarcastically to thank Violet for the card she "sent" him, though Violet takes his sarcasm literally. Ultimately, Charlie Brown visits Lucy in her psychiatric booth. On her advice that he needs more involvement, she asks him to direct a school nativity play. On the way to the auditorium, Charlie Brown stops by Snoopy\'s doghouse, only to find him frantically busy decorating it. After Charlie Brown demands an explanation, Snoopy hands him a flyer about a neighborhood lights and display contest which upsets Charlie Brown because even his own dog has gone commercial. En route to the rehearsals, he runs into his sister Sally, who asks him to write her letter to Santa Claus; her telling him to put in a request for large sums of money  causes Charlie Brown to become even more dismayed. Charlie Brown arrives at the rehearsals, but try as he might, he cannot seem to get control of the situation as the uncooperative kids are more interested in modernizing the play with dancing and lively music. Charlie Brown, on the other hand, is determined not to let the play become commercial and to focus on the traditional side of the story. Thinking the play requires "the proper mood", Charlie Brown decides they need a Christmas tree. So Lucy takes over the crowd and dispatches Charlie Brown to get a "big, shiny aluminum tree". With Linus in tow, Charlie Brown sets off on his quest. But when they get to the tree market, Charlie Brown zeroes in on a small baby tree which, ironically as well as symbolically, is the only real tree on the lot. Linus is reluctant about Charlie Brown\'s choice, but Charlie Brown is convinced that after decorating it, it will be just right for the play. They return to the school auditorium with the tree and everybody laughs at Charlie Brown, especially Lucy, about his choice. Second guessing himself, Charlie Brown begins to wonder if he really knows what Christmas is all about, loudly asking the question in despair. Linus quietly says he can tell him, and walks to center stage to make his point. Under a spotlight, Linus quotes the second chapter of the Gospel according to Luke, verses 8 through 14 from the King James Version.  "\'8And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night. 9And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid. 10And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. 11For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, which is Christ the Lord. 12And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger. 13And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying, 14Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace and goodwill towards men.\'"   "...And that\'s what Christmas is all about, Charlie Brown."  Charlie Brown now realizes he does not have to let commercialism ruin his Christmas. With a newly found sense of inspiration, he quietly picks up the little tree and walks out of the auditorium, intending to take the tree home to decorate and show the others it will work in the play. On the way, he stops at Snoopy&#39;s decorated doghouse, which now sports a first prize blue ribbon for winning the display contest. He puts an ornamental ball on the top of his tree; the branch, with the ball still on it, promptly flops over to one side instead of remaining upright, prompting him to declare &#34;I&#39;ve killed it&#34; and run off in disgust at his perpetual failure. Unbeknownst to Charlie Brown; the rest of the gang, having also heard Linus&#39;s recitation, began to realize they were a little too rough on Charlie Brown and have quietly followed him from the auditorium. Linus goes up to the little tree and gently props the drooping branch back to its upright position, ornament and all; and wraps his security blanket around the tree. After they add the remaining decorations from Snoopy&#39;s doghouse to the tree, the kids then start humming the Christmas carol, &#34;Hark! The Herald Angels Sing.&#34; When Charlie Brown sees what they have done with the tree, he cannot believe his eyes, and the kids give him a rousing "Merry Christmas, Charlie Brown!" before singing &#34;Hark! The Herald Angels Sing&#34; as the end credits roll.  The story touches on the over-commercialization and secularism of Christmas, and serves to remind viewers of &#34;the true meaning of Christmas&#34; , continuing a theme explored by satirists such as Stan Freberg and Tom Lehrer during the 1950s.'] ['Tweety is cleaning out his nest ("This is what I get for dreaming of a [[White Christmas  when both Sylvester and another red cat notice him. They both try to catch him, only to run into each other. The red cat bashes Sylvester over the head and takes Tweety, but Sylvester retaliates. The rest of the cartoon involves Sylvester and his fellow feline constantly trying to one-up each other and get Tweety, who seems to merely be enjoying himself . The short climaxes when Sylvester and the red cat see Tweety\'s hat on a thin ice rink, and go after it. Tweety is then revealed to be cutting a circle around them; he asks for his hat, which Sylvester desperately obliges in a bid for mercy, and finishes the circle, causing the cats to fall into the frigid water. Back from where we started before, Tweety is shown in the next scene resuming shoveling snow out of his nest. Sylvester and the red cat are in their homes with their feet in warm water, constantly sneezing. Tweety says "Gesundheit!" to each, and resumes his work as the cartoon fades out.'] ['Huey, Dewey and Louie Duck are enjoying a nice, leisure swim in the lake.

Sam runs back to the airfield and grabs another plane. While he looks for Bugs, Bugs comes up behind him and buzz-saws right through Sam's plane.

Having sighted and targeted Bugs, he releases the bombs, but he falls out of his plane and gets caught in the explosion of his bombs on the ground. Sam takes to the skies in a dinky little plane, which at the push of a lever transforms into a fierce fighting machine quadplane loaded with machine guns. Sam pulls the switche to full power, but this rips the plane into three parts, making Sam fall and get blasted to bits in the ammunition dump.

Van Dyke is offended by Leatherby\'s arrogance and ignorance.  They go to dinner at the Katacombe restaurant, ostensibly to discuss the proposed swap, accompanied by Van Dyke\'s assistant, M/Sgt. Eddie McCulloch. In actuality, Van Dyke wants Leatherby to see the cost of the trade: the elderly female piano player and her blind husband  demanded for Johnny\'s return. When the Americans move to detain them for forged identity papers, the couple attempts suicide by using strychnine. Van Dyke has them taken to a U.S. military hospital under the care of Major Foster, the cigarette-mooching doctor in charge. The husband is near death. The wife is in better shape and conscious, and Eddie discovers in interrogating her that she is actually English and demanding to talk to someone in British Intelligence. Van Dyke recognizes that he could be in legal jeopardy if the British determine he is using one of their citizens as a player in a "swap shop." The woman identifies herself as Rachel Cameron, wife of Gen. Gerd von Kratzenow, an anti-Nazi conspirator, and reveals that the people wanting them are not Russians but former Nazis working now with the communists. Leatherby begins to understand the complications involved.  Friends are often really enemies, and adversaries sometimes secret allies. Van Dyke learns that his friend and Soviet counterpart, Col. Lodejinski, has been betrayed attempting to escape to the West and has committed suicide with his whole family. He also is told that Rachel Cameron acted as a spy for the Allies during the war. Van Dyke considers submitting to the demands and trading the elderly couple for the soldier. He provides Leatherby with this stark choice. While using Hoffy, with whom Van Dyke had once engaged in an ill-advised love affair, as an intermediary, he causes jealousy on the part of his secretary, Ricky Cates. Hoffy\'s loyalty comes under question; she is the common thread in so many twists. Van Dyke arranges for Johnny to be delivered by Russian ambulance to the American hospital to complete the trade, but concocts a dangerous double-cross in which he has to intentionally poison himself to succeed.'] ["A young baseball player faces the tragic circumstances of the internment of 110,000 Americans of Japanese ancestry during World War II.

A search is then initiated to find a new Queen. The following day, Esther and her cousin Mordecai  are talking on the streets of Persia. Esther is asking for Mordecai's advice, but his questions reveal that Esther knows what to do but lacks the courage to follow through. He tells her that she should not be afraid to do what is right. When Haman drives up in search of eligible maidens to be the future Queen, Mordecai tries to hide because of bad blood between he and Haman.

He attempts to express his thoughts and doubts to his wife Becky, but she remains unconvinced that life is horrible and thinks he is crazy and going to hell. Convinced that people have come to have too much influence over art, he tries to play music not written by people by drawing music lines on his glasses and playing the stars as if they were notes.

When the rich man showed up to see how he was fighting, he found the soldier standing and playing the concertina during a battle.

These aliens, which are known as the Uchuu Kaijuu, or Space Monsters , seem dedicated to the eradication of the human species as the latter takes its first steps away from the solar system, and they are getting closer and closer to Earth. Humanity has responded by developing space-going battleships and giant fighting robots. These complex robots—RX-7 Machine Weapons—are actually an advanced type of fighting suit, piloted by a single occupant. As advanced as they are, however, they are being used as trainers for a new weapon, the Gunbuster. However, being relatively new technology, they are difficult to operate , so pilot candidates are selected from the best and brightest youth on Earth and the Lunar colony. These are trained at schools around the world. The story begins in the year 2023, not long after the first battles with the aliens, and centers on young Noriko Takaya  . Although Noriko\'s father was a famous admiral in the space fleet who went missing following one of the first battles of the war, her own talents as a pilot are questionable—especially when compared to the other students. Nonetheless, she has entered a training school on Okinawa, where she is largely influenced by her instructor, Kouichirou Ohta , who was one of Admiral Takaya\'s crew. He has faith that she will overcome her early clumsiness, while other students are critical of her inability. Noriko idolizes the beautiful, competent and talented Kazumi Amano  . She is not alone, the other students recognize that Amano is the top RX-7 pilot at the school, and likely the entire world. Coach Ohta shows the extra training which Amano creates for herself, inspiring Noriko to look within herself for strengths which she did not know that she had. Only two Gunbuster pilots from each school will be selected for the real mission. Amano, of course, will be going, and all of the others want the second slot on the team. Takaya is determined to win, not only to be with Amano but also to find  her father. She is thrilled to discover that she has in fact been chosen as the second Japanese pilot. Following that selection, conflict between Takaya and other students comes to a head, when the second-best RX-7 pilot at the school publicly challenges her to a one-on-one fight. Planned for late at night, when none of the school authorities will be around to stop it, Ohta learns of the duel and comes to the battleground—but does nothing. He is there to observe, and perhaps to save Takaya\'s life, if the combat gets too intensive. Takaya is on the defensive from the start, and the older student humiliates her by action and over the radio. As Takaya\'s RX-7 is pummeled, Noriko realizes that her difficulties are a case of sensory overload—she is getting too much information from the electronic monitoring systems. She turns off her monitors, but as the systems go dark, her opponent is infuriated by the perceived insult and prepares the final, killing blow. Just as it appears that Noriko is doomed, she destroys her opponent\'s RX-7 with a "Thunder Kick." Her opponent muses that the school rookie has beat her with an advanced maneuver which she hadn\'t been taught. This is the proof that Ohta was seeking, that Noriko had an innate ability which would be invaluable in the battles to come. Together, with Coach Ohta and Amano, Takaya is sent into space to train with other representatives from all over the solar system in preparation for the attack upon the space monsters. There they are introduced to a soviet pilot from the moon base by the name of Jung Freud. On their first training mission, Takaya and Amano are stopped by Jung, and challenged to a duel. Amano and Jung become completely involved in the fight, as Noriko trails along, and all three get lost within the machinery of the space station. The fight stops midway, when all three come in contact with the first space monster that was defeated and captured. Once they return they are scolded by their coach, but because of their importance to the missions success as well as building feelings between the coach and them, they are let go with a simple warning. Jung later apologizes for her challenge, and thus begins a friendship with the two. As they move farther into space, the young pilots are placed in their quarters for subspace traveling. On a dare Takaya is sent into the hangars and meets a male space pilot named Toren Smith. Amano comes into doubt of Takaya\'s abilities and asks the Coach to end their partnership. Takaya overhears the conversation and ends up partnering with Smith instead. The first true battle between the aliens begin, and the humans realize how vastly outmaneuvered and outnumbered they are. They are able to retreat with limited casualties, but Takaya has lost Smith, and gained an uncontrollable fear towards deep space combat. As their second battle approaches, Takaya is determined to improve and asks the Coach for private lessons. Jung finds out and thinking that she doing so to control Gunbuster, challenges her in space. But even before they are able to fight, Takaya breaks down within her suit and is taken to the infirmary. Seeing as how they are outmatched the captain decides to immediately travel back to Earth in secrecy as to keep the location of Earth secret. The plan is unsuccessful, and the fleet is attacked in sub-space, leading to the destruction of the majority of the fleet. Once they reach Earth\'s orbit, only the Exelion and a couple minor cruisers are still alive. The second battle starts and things look grim for everyone. Finally Takaya realizes what she must do, and helps her friends and crew members. She takes control of the incomplete Gunbuster and manages to force the enemy to retreat. Takaya and friends then must face the trauma of war and the discovery of loss. Once this battle is over, the story goes back to Earth, and Takaya, Amano and Jung realize how much things have changed. Her old nemesis who had previously challenged her at school is now the coach for new pilots. Her best friend is now a mother with a 3 year old daughter, and Earth has been working on a 70&nbsp;km long space ship as a safety in case Earth is ever attacked. While in a peaceful lull Takaya and friends try to re-adjust to living in a world that has already passed them by. Takaya tries to reconnect with her friend, while Amano tries to share her feelings with the Coach. The peace is broken, however, when Earth is notified that a fleet of space monsters, much bigger than anything comparable is headed towards Earth. After many arguments, the idea of sending the old Exelion as an unmanned black hole bomb, is proposed. The Gunbuster is nominated to escort the bomb there, and then to come home. Takaya and Amano, in separate ships which conjoin into Gunbuster, are sent out, a trip that will last an hour or more to them, but half a year to everyone back on Earth. As they almost reach their goal, Amano breaks down, admitting that she does not want go forward, since each second forward means the longer she is away from their Coach, who is now dying from space radiation. Takaya is able to convince her to continue, and their mission is a success. When they come back, it turns out that the Coach is still alive and Amano and he get married. The final episode starts 15 years later, when the Coach is dead. The aliens are coming back, and in retaliation Earth has been working on a small planet sized black hole bomb, which has been created using the mass of Jupiter pressured into the size of the moon, Buster Machine III. This when it is detonated, along with 3,000 \'slave mines\' placed around the center of the galaxy, will cause a black hole to be formed that will suck the space monsters in. Amano is sent back up to a new Eltrion to fight in a new mobile suit called Sizzlers: buster sized machines, piloted individually. While she has been busy in marriage, Jung had taken over as Takaya\'s partner up in space. Amano and Takaya meet once more, and Amano expresses her love for Takaya which has grown while the two have been apart. Takaya, at first, is withdrawn seeing the changes and maturity in Amano in just 6 months her time. When the final battle begins, Amano is ordered to man Gunbuster with Takaya, and both fight alongside others to defend the bomb. The alien army is fended off, allowing the black hole bomb to be set. When the time comes to activate, however, they find out the enemies\' attacks have damaged 2% of the \'slave generators\' required for implosion. Amano and Takaya decide to dive down into the core of Buster Machine III and activate it by using one of Gunbusters two Degeneracy reactors, even though doing so means they will likely be unable to leave without suffering severe relativistic time dilation during their escape. After the bomb is set off, Noriko and Kazumi spend 12,000 Earth years objective traveling home, although for them only hours or days have passed. Upon arriving in Earth orbit, the pilots cannot make contact with anyone nor see any sign of habitation on the planet, suggesting that human civilization is long gone. However, their despair is instantly dispelled when a massive light pattern suddenly appears on the planet saying "WELCOME HOME!"  Delighted that their home civilization is alive and well after so long, the pilots abandon their mecha to land on the planet.'] ['Cohen  and his rival Goldberg  enlist in the Union Army during the American Civil War.

Tom leaps for joy and dashes preparing for surfing and he wakes up Jerry. Tom carries his surfboard out to the deck, but runs into many bumps and falls until he finally makes it to the sea out of a fishing boat. Tom lands on a large blue lump that reveals itself to be a shark. Tom peers over at the other surfers and he hits the shark on the head repeatedly until his head has lumps, knocking him out. Tom surfs a large wave until he spots the shark below him, laughing demonically. Tom pulls himself up to the top of the wave until he is sucked beneath the water and soon encounters the shark again. Tom turns his arms such that he rows with them and speeds away from the shark, launching a foot into the air. He taunts the shark again but scrapes the sand and runs into a rock. A mound of sand covers him and the surfboard is up against the rock, giving the mound the appearance of a grave. Jerry walks onto the "grave" and drops a flower onto it. He takes off his hat as a salute but grabbed by Tom, who spits out the flower. The sand comes off Tom\'s head and it is shown a red starfish has grabbed a hold of it.

Like Ready, Woolen and Able, this short begins with a juxtaposition of how Ralph and Sam get to work. Sam wakes up at dawn and takes a leisurely stroll to work as Ralph sleeps in and the sun rises. Just as Sam reaches the punch clock and lifts his hair to read the time, Ralph\'s alarm clock goes off, triggering the conveyor system that he uses to get to work. A claw lifts his blanket, his bed tilts, dropping him into a trap door where he falls into the shower, after a second in the shower a spring below him engages, sending him into a towel and onto a roller skate. As he rides the roller skate down its rail and dries off with the towel, he is fed a slice of toast and coffee. Finally, he grabs his lunch from a hook and rides the roller skate out his front door, down the path, and punches into work before Sam. As always, the two merrily greet each other.  1. Ralph begins with the straightforward approach of sneaking into the field and snatching a sheep. As he walks back, Sam drops a banana peel which Ralph slips on. Instead of falling immediately, Ralph slides around on the banana peel, and on his way back Sam snags the stolen sheep with a lasso. As Ralph continues to slide forward, he begins to say "Ooh, I\'d like to..." only to hit a tree face-first. 2. This time Ralph digs a hole under Sam and out the side of the cliff face, and decides to try to snatch a sheep with a lasso in the same way Sam did in Ralph\'s last attempt. This is successful, but while Ralph is pulling the sheep up Sam leans over the edge and into Ralph\'s hole, where he glares at Ralph intimidatingly. Ralph innocently lowers the sheep down, but Sam grabs Ralph by the neck and hits him on the head, propelling him into a tree trunk. As Ralph climbs out of the tree trunk, he resembles a stack of pancakes.  3. Ralph\'s next plan is to tunnel under Sam, cut out a circle of earth around Sam with a saw, and jack that circle high into the air with a jack. Successful, Ralph ties a dinner napkin around his neck and prepares to steal a sheep. However, as he\'s doing this, Sam pulls out a corkscrew and removes the piece of earth that the jack is supporting, sending the entire chunk of earth crashing onto Ralph. 4. In Ralph\'s fourth attempt, he ties himself to a bunch of helium balloons and floats over Sam. Sam calmly pours a box of BB pellets into his mouth and shoots at Ralph\'s balloons with a blow gun. Ralph is left grasping on to a single balloon, but the knot on the balloon slips and Ralph is projected into Sam. Sam grabs Ralph by the neck and prepares to drop him off the cliff. However, before that can happen, the punch clock whistle blows and Sam and Ralph head off for lunch. They enjoy their sandwiches and Sam shares his coffee with Ralph, then they have a smoke break. They both walk back to the cliff, and as soon as the whistle blows to signal the end of lunch, Sam grabs Ralph by the neck and finally drops him. 5. Ralph\'s next plan is to build a large slide behind Sam and dropping a cannon ball down the slide. Sam casually points a large spring at the end of the slide, sending the cannon ball back up the slide and into Ralph\'s dropped jaw. Ralph angrily walks away as the cannon ball inside his tail weighs him down. 6. Ralph then attempts to use a record titled "Music to put sheep dogs to sleep by" to put Sam to sleep. This appears to be successful, and Ralph tests to make sure that Sam really is asleep, in much the same way as he tested to make sure Sam couldn\'t see him in Double or Mutton. After walking off, stealing a sheep and preparing to eat it, the sheep turns out to be Sam is disguise, also similar to Double or Mutton. However, the two of them continue to remove disguises. * Ralph turns out to be a sheep * Sam turns out to be Ralph * The sheep turns out to be Sam * Ralph turns out to be a sheep * Sam turns out to be Ralph Finally, Ralph grabs the sheep by the neck, and the sheep turns out to be a stick of dynamite.

Jerry gets annoyed having to share with an oversized \'mouse\'. Jerry then overhears Mammy on the phone talking to the doctor about Tom. He hears that Tom is suffering from amnesia. Seeing Tom approaching her with mischief on his mind, Mammy cuts her phone conversation short and attempts to evade him by walking away on stilts. Tom pulls the stilts from under her causing Mammy to fall and he runs back into the mouse hole.  Jerry then runs to get the medical encyclopedia to learn more about amnesia. He reads that "memory can be restored by a sharp blow on the head". Jerry whistles and gets Tom\'s attention with a piece of cheese. Jerry then hides behind a curtain with a baseball bat. Tom starts searching for Jerry and every time Jerry swings to hit Tom, Tom coincidentally moves out of the way, exhausting Jerry. Jerry then tries dropping a bowling ball onto a piece of wood where a piece of cheese is sitting. Tom comes out of the mouse hole and eats the cheese. Jerry drops the ball, launching Tom headfirst into the ceiling. This cures him of his amnesia, but when Tom lands back onto the wood, the bowling ball flies into the air and falls on his head, sending him back to his mouse-like state. Jerry then puts down a trail of cheese for Tom and he tries to drop a vase on his head. He misses. Jerry sets down another trail of cheese that leads under the piano. Jerry has tied a string to the piano leg and when Tom walks under the piano, Jerry pulls the leg out of the piano causing it to fall. Again, Jerry\'s attempts miss. Tom continues the trail through a door and an iron barely misses him as well. Tom reaches a big piece of cheese and Jerry cuts a rope tied to an anvil. But the anvil cuts off the back of his skin and crashes through the floor, again missing him. Jerry sits down disgusted, he\'s tried everything.  Tom then gives Jerry a piece of cheese, but Jerry doesn\'t want it and throws it away. It lands in an egg cup on the shelf, which rolls and knocks a dish, which rolls into a laundry basket and into the broom. The broom falls over and releases a door which holds the ironing board which hits Tom on the head curing him of his amnesia. Jerry lets out a happy scream and runs to his mouse hole. He kisses Tom and then lies down on his bed to relax. Tom also lies down right outside Jerry\'s mouse hole. Jerry looks outside and sees Mammy  reading the medical book and holding a baseball bat whilst creeping stealthily towards the sleeping cat. She says she is going to cure Tom of his amnesia with a blow to the head. Jerry motions to stop her but she hits Tom anyway, unknowingly bringing his amnesia back. Jerry returns to his mouse hole whilst Tom, after once again dealing with Mammy, re-enters the mouse-hole,and returns to his mouse-like state. Tom kicks Jerry out of his bed, lies on the bed and breaks it once again, leaving Jerry frustrated.'] ['The film shows a selection of Suras from the Qur\'an, interspersed with newspaper clippings and media clips with The Arabian Dance and Åses død as an underscore.<ref namehttp://www.nrc.nl/international/article1028543.ece/Fitna_the_Movie_not_hyperbole_or_metaphor_but_repetition|titleBas|last2008-03-28|accessdateNRC Handelsblad}}<ref namehttp://www.washingtontimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID\'Fitna\' premiere fails to shock|date2008-03-31|workLeander|lasthttp://story.malaysiasun.com/index.php/ct/9/cid/b8de8e630faf3631/id/342114/cs/1/|titleMalaysia Sun|date2008-04-01}}  Wilders said the 15-minute film shows how verses from the Qur\'an are being used today to incite modern Muslims to behave violently and anti-democratically based on those verses.<ref nameKoranfilm Wilders heet \'het kwaad\'|languagehttp://www.telegraaf.nl/binnenland/3253921/_Koranfilm_Wilders_heet__het_kwaad___.html?pageNumbertelegraaf.nl|date2008-03-08}}<ref namehttp://www.spectator.co.uk/print/the-magazine/features/553681/a-filmmaker-who-lives-in-the-shadow-of-a-fatwa.thtml|titleDouglas|lastSpectator.co.uk|date2008-03-24}}{{cite mailing list}} He later described the film as "a call to shake off the creeping tyranny of Islamization,"{{cite news|urlSPIEGEL Interview with Dutch Populist Geert Wilders: \'Moderate Islam Is a Contradiction\'|date2008-03-31|firstTraufetter|workThe Qur\'an and terrorism"veryshockingimages">{{cite news}} Suras are juxtaposed to video clips of Imams stating Islamic teaching, and videos of violent atrocities committed in the name of Islam, including major terrorist attacks.{{cite news}} is translated as: {{Quote}}Footage of the September 11 attacks is shown, followed by the Madrid train bombings.{{cite news}} is shown as a justification for Islamic antisemitism.

The lazy park ranger gets the resident bears to "put it in the bag", by singing and dancing to a lively song. The bears happily collect the trash, bouncing and jouncing until they discover the ranger\'s trick. Angrily they dump their bags of refuse on the ground. The ranger prepares some chicken cacciatore, but will not give it to the bears unless they clean up their sections of the park. All of the bears move their garbage into Humphrey\'s section. In order to get his dinner, Humphrey has to make it fast by stuffing the garbage into a bag, but it gets caught by a bush and rips apart, letting the garbage out. Then he receives a new bag and follows the garbage down the line all the way to the cliff, but falls off. Next, he attempts to conceal the garbage under a bush, but a rabbit pushes it out in disgust. Next, he tries to burn it with a match, only to be stopped by Smokey Bear!  Finally, Humphrey puts all of the trash into a hollow stump, which is actually a geyser named "Ol\' Fateful". The ranger prepares to reward Humphrey with a whole dish full of cacciatore but before Humphrey can take it, the geyser suddenly erupts, spouting garbage everywhere, resulting in Humphrey having to start all over at cleaning up the park.'] ["The narrator  states that increased cultural diversity has necessitated the exposition of previously unwritten rules regarding the use of male restrooms. According to these rules, males should use restrooms as quickly as possible, maximize physical separation from each other when using urinals, flush urinals when they contain concentrated urine, avoid stalls with unflushed toilets, and avoid eye contact and communication with others. The film depicts a scenario in which excess communication leads to a mess in the restroom and thus deficient hygiene and homeostasis, the latter of which is in the lowest tier in Maslow's hierarchy of needs. As the scenario continues, the restroom occupants turn to violence, leading to police and biological hazard team involvement that closes the restroom. Forced to go elsewhere, other men repeat the scenario, eventually leading to complete societal breakdown."] ["Risque goings-on during an afternoon at a broken-down Burlesque variety show. the show also includes a (live-action, comedy which features the Watson Sisters who perform 'I'm Playing With Fire' followed with the Bouncing Ball."] ["Sophie comes to New York from France with the intention of meeting up with a man she met a few months before.

He hypnotizes the bear into thinking he is a canary. Bugs then asks Elmer, "What\'s up, doc?". Elmer states he has him right where he wants him and starts to hypnotize Bugs . Bugs fools Elmer by giving him a balloon with long ears and he hears the bear he hypnotized earlier chirping and falls to the ground. Then he chases Bugs and fights over the gun. Then he cries on a tree and Bugs asks what\'s wrong. Elmer tells him that he  won\'t cooperate when he tries to hypnotize him. Bugs says he will cooperate. Then, as Elmer hypnotizes Bugs, Bugs hypnotizes him instead, and commands him to be a rabbit.

By accident, Nyatta drowns in the bathtub and while being clinically dead he sees his sister leaving the house holding hands with the Japanese version of Ksitigarbha,  and follows them. Nyatta tries to claim his sister\'s soul back by pulling her arm. Jizou doesn\'t let go and Nyāko\'s soul gets split in two. Her brother runs away with one half. Jizou sends a clue about a flower they must search for in order to retrieve the missing part, then walks away with the other half. Meanwhile, Nyatta\'s father finds his son in the bathtub and revives him. Then, all the family members gather in Nyāko\'s room to find out that she is dead.

During their outing they visit the \'Big Whale Circus\', the final act of which is a giant penguin-looking bird "filled" with various weather, causes a flood of water which covers everything. The two of them end up on an Ark-esque boat with a pig, which they eventually begin to eat . God drains the world of the oceans , leaving the cats and pig stranded in a desert. The pig bites off Nyatta\'s arm, which is repaired by a desert-dweller who makes dolls from the pieces of other cats.

They are fed, and when full the man attempts to turn them into soup, attacking them with a pair of scissors. He ends up falling into the cauldron, Nyatta cuts him into pieces with the scissors and the cats escape. Wandering further across the desert dehydrated, Nyatta digs and finds an elephant made of water, which cools them off and travels with them, though the elephant eventually evaporates from the heat. God accidentally stops the flow of time and disrupts space, and the cats play with the time-frozen scenes. Father Time turns time back on, shooting it forward and reversing it, showing various scenes of random events either rapidly going forth in time or back.

A police van eventually carts all those involved away except Stan and Ollie, who afterwards try and find their own headgear amongst the hundreds of others lying on the street."] ["Even as a young girl, Sara Iijima was a large-breasted woman. Because of this, she had felt self-conscious about herself... especially with men who were constantly leering at her. This only intensified when she was attacked by a rapist with a breast fetish. Although she escaped unharmed, this only made worse her insecurities. It was only because of the intervention of Dr. Chang that she was able to feel good about herself. Out of gratitude, Sara became Dr. Chang's protege in the method of psychic feedback, the method which was used to cure her of her insecurities. However, Dr. Sara's method of therapy is vastly different than what Dr. Chang had used. By swinging her huge breasts in a circle, she is able to induce a hypnotic trance in her patients, after which she is able to learn what is bothering the patient and offer the proper solution. There is a risk of using this: Sara is often vulnerable to the sexual appetites of her patients and she must maintain control of the situation Sara is not alone, though. She is often accompanied by Tamine, a man who cannot seem to get a woman, no matter how he tries. But Tamine is devoted to Sara , and aids her in helping others in need."] ['An old flame  of businessman Titus Tillsbury ([[James Finlayson  threatens to expose their past, destroying both his marriage and career.

It is World War I, and the ever-cheerful Bosko is a doughboy eating down in a trench. Enemy fire destroys his meal, and later a picture of his girlfriend, Honey. Bosko shows a rare moment of anger, but is quickly cheered up by a fellow soldier. The two begin to dance, only to be interrupted by more gunfire. Bosko finally decides to fight back and downs an enemy bomber  by using a fellow soldier as a cannon. A friendly hippopotamus is shot down by heavy artillery, which Bosko destroys with a pair of longjohns-turned-catapult. He then saves the wounded soldier by unzipping his navel and retrieving the shell inside. The projectile explodes anyway, turning the already black-faced Bosko even blacker and prompting him to exclaim "Mammy!" à la Al Jolson. Bosko the Doughboy is notable for its departure from the standard cartoon formula of its era. Bosko is usually infallibly happy and chipper; Doughboy forces him to drop this demeanor and fight back. Other Bosko shorts concentrate primarily on Bosko cavorting with other characters in a musical wonderland; in Doughboy, Bosko can\'t dance more than a few seconds before coming under enemy fire. Bosko\'s cartoons generally have little to no conflict; Doughboy is nothing but fighting. In short, Bosko the Doughboy is almost a total departure from other shorts in the series . It is usually regarded as a high point of the character\'s cartoon career.'] ['Betty is the MC of "Making Stars", a stage revue introducing the "stars of tomorrow": a series of performing babies. Acts include the Colorful 3 , an Asian baby marksman, and a bouncing Russian baby named "Little Miss Trotsky."'] ['The film focuses on Ronald, a young boy who wants to become a builder or surveyor when he grows up. He voices this ambition to his older and more cautious cousins Paul and Jane, who tell him he knows nothing about the hazards of building sites. The cousins then stage a series of elaborate fantasies which are presented as though real: they are in charge of a Star Trek-style teleporter which they use to send Ronald into various building sites and other dangerous areas to look for his lost dog . In each location he is killed by his inability to recognise danger, the dog whining as it sniffs his lifeless hand and the watching cousins shaking their heads over his mistakes. Each time he is restored to life by the teleporter, as cocky as before and ready for another "challenge", except the last time when the cousins have joined him in the danger area and are thus unable to "rescue" him. Some of the footage of Ronald\'s deaths is very graphic, showing the boy being buried alive in a trench collapse, electrocuted in a half-demolished house, run over by an earthmoving vehicle, breaking his skull after falling off a pipe against a concrete wall, crushed beneath a falling pile of bricks, and ultimately drowning in a disused quarry; each time he is about to die, the sound of a heartbeat is played on the soundtrack to warn viewers and give them a chance to shut their eyes. At the end of the film, and back in the real world, Ronald announces that he has abandoned the idea of working on a building site, and the children go outside to play; over the closing shot of the film, one of the child actors reads out real-life stories of children killed in dangerous areas such as those the viewer has witnessed.'] ["French filmmaker Jérémie Carboni followed French writer Daniel Pennac during rehearsals of Bartleby the scrivener's reading in Pépinière Opéra theatre in Paris.

Then when the film looks like it is coming to an end, Lupo's severed head jumps into the credits box and comments about the people who worked on the film. He then falls asleep and the screen fades to black."] ["Upon learning that Mr. Pratt, the mean old school board chairman, has fired their beloved teacher Miss Pipps because she threw a birthday party for one of her students during class, the gang decides to invite their parents to a special performance of a play exposing Pratt's injustices in running the school.

Inside Day is a day scene with a sun in the center, and inside Night is a night scene with a moon in the center. Whatever goes on inside of Day or Night expresses normal events that typically occur within a day or night, respectively, and these events often correspond with actions or emotions that the characters Day or Night express. For example, when Day is happy he will have a rainbow inside him, and when Night is happy he will have fireworks inside him. Day and Night meet and at first are uneasy about each other. They become jealous of each other due to the events occurring in their insides, and end up fighting at one point in the short. Eventually they see the positives in each other and learn to like each other. At the end of the film the things they saw in each other they see in themselves, as Day becomes night, and Night becomes day.'] ['{{plot|section|date"DVD Outsider: Made In Britain Synopsis and Review"/> The deputy superintendent in the assessment centre, Peter Clive ([[Bill Stewart , admits Trevor, and he is allocated a room with Errol ([[Terry Richards .

Victor and his parents search for Sparky while the classmates invade the lab, discovering Victor\'s reanimation formula. The classmates separately perform their experiments, which go awry and turn the dead animals into monsters—Weird Girl\'s living cat Mr. Whiskers holds a dead bat while it is electrocuted, turning him into a vampire cat; Edgar turns a dead rat he found in the garbage into a wererat; Nassor revives his mummified hamster Colossus; Toshiaki\'s turtle Shelley is covered in a growth formula and turns into a giant Gamera-like monster; and Bob\'s Sea-Monkeys grow into amphibious humanoid monsters. The monsters break loose into the town fair where they wreak havoc. After finding Sparky at the town cemetery, Victor sees the monsters attacking the fair and goes to help his classmates deal with them—-the Sea-Monkeys explode after eating salt-covered popcorn, and Colossus is stepped on by Shelley, while the rat and Shelley are returned to their original, deceased forms after being electrocuted. During the chaos, the town mayor\'s niece Elsa van Helsing, who is also Victor\'s crush, is grabbed by Mr. Whiskers and carried to the town windmill. The townsfolk blame Sparky for her disappearance and chase him to the windmill, which the mayor accidentally ignites with his torch. Victor and Sparky enter the burning windmill and rescue Elsa, but Victor is trapped inside. Sparky rescues Victor, only to be dragged back inside by Mr. Whiskers. Both pets are killed when the windmill collapses. To reward Sparky for his bravery, the townsfolk gather to revive Sparky with their car batteries, reanimating him once more.'] ["In Mickey's Mellerdrammer Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Goofy , and the rest of the gang present their own low budget light hearted rendition of the 19th century Tom Shows for a crowd in a barn converted into a theater for the occasion. Horace Horsecollar plays the white slave owner Simon Legree, whip and all. Minnie plays the young white girl Eva. Mickey plays old Uncle Tom with cotton around his ears and chin, and the young slave girl Topsy. Clarabelle Cow plays the slave woman Eliza. Goofy plays the production stage hand. The cartoon opens with Mickey and Clarabelle Cow in their dressing rooms applying blackface makeup for their roles. The cartoon is much more focused on the Disney characters' efforts to put on the play, than an animated version of Uncle Tom's Cabin. The cartoon contains many images of Mickey and his gang using makeshift props, as light hearted sight gags. The cartoon closes with the characters coming out for a bow, and Horace Horsecollar's character is pelted with rotten tomatoes. When Goofy shows his face from behind the stage, he is hit with what appears to be a chocolate pie, leaving him in what appears to be blackface."] ['Bugs Bunny, looking for a place to pass the night, happens on an abandoned farm house, which, unbeknownst to Bugs, is the hideout of two gangsters, Rocky and Hugo. After claiming "Huh! Sounds like Inner Sanctum" while opening the squeaky front door, he drills a hole in the ground, dons a nightcap, descends in a manner as if walking down spiral stairs and goes to sleep. Shortly thereafter, Rocky and Hugo return pursued by rival gangsters . The running gunfight continues as they take cover inside the farmhouse; Bugs comically gets up in the middle of the gunfight  to use the bathroom and get a glass of water before returning to bed just as the shooting ends. Later while Rocky is doling out his and Hugo\'s shares of the money from the heist they just pulled, Bugs slyly cuts in after noticing Rocky isn\'t paying attention. He poses as several gang members until he gets all of the money. Rocky then wises up, and demands the money back. Bugs refuses, even suntanning under the light Hugo uses in an attempt via the third degree to find out where the money is hid. Rocky then has Hugo take Bugs for a ride, which he gladly accepts, claiming "I could use a breath of fresh air!" Bugs returns to the house without Hugo , and Rocky at first doesn\'t notice. When he does, he threatens Bugs continuously . He demands to know where the "dough" is, and after promising not to look  gets a bowl of pie-dough in the face. Bugs then poses as Mugsy, another gangster , who threatens that "It\'s curtains for you, Rocky" as if he is going to execute Rocky, and then pulls an actual set of curtains from inside his jacket and hangs them over Rocky\'s head . Bugs then pretends to be the police, and has Rocky hide inside a chest while he "deals with" the police. In faux pas, Bugs acts out the police breaking in, demanding to know Rocky\'s whereabouts, a fight ensuing over the chest which he is in , and Bugs play-acting a fight in which he eventually throws the cop out the window. During the phony fight Bugs opens the chest and hands Rocky a time bomb , and after Bugs declares he has taken care of the cops the bomb promptly detonates, leaving Rocky\'s clothes tattered and in shreds. Rocky asks which direction the cops went, and after Bugs points the way, he flees the house by jumping through the window while desirably screaming to be arrested and not wanting to be left "with that crazy rabbit!" Bugs sighs, "Some guys just can\'t take it, see? Nah, nah, nah, nah!"'] ["The Driver is hired by a nervous movie manager to spy on a paranoid actor's wife.

El , a crew member, walks through the corridors of the ship when he discovers the eponymous magic portal, a rectangular arch flashing with various colors. Entering the portal, he is transported into a world of passageways. Some LEGO creatures appear and build a small car for him to drive through the world of passages. He then has a close encounter with a two-headed monster who chases him through the various paths of the mysterious world. After El\'s car has a bump from a crossing train, the car falls apart. El finds another portal, and nearly gets eaten by the monster, who ends up in the real world while chasing a leftover tyre from the devoured car and attacks Lindsay Fleay. El reports his experiences to Captain Paranoia, but neither him nor his shipmate Pee believes him. However, Captain Paranoia finds another Portal, which takes him to a "white expanse" world, where a plasticine creature messes around with him, making him very annoyed and then flushs him out of the white coloured world. The plasticine creature then goes back through the portal Captain Paranoia came through. The Captain then finds his way back to the ship, and tells El and Pee about what happened in the Portal. El, Pee, Captain Paranoia and the Plasticine creature, go through the Portal, and find themselves in the real world, and get chased by liquid paper daleks. The four escape the liquid paper daleks, which are scared off by the two-headed monster that El had an encounter with earlier, in a shoe car.

As the set is rebuilt, El walks through the ship corridors again. The film ends as the screen goes through the Portal.'] ['The Stooges are firemen who are constantly getting in trouble. After missing their umpteenth fire call, they are warned that one more incident will cost them their jobs. They then proceeded back to work, in this case, cleaning the fire hoses. In the midst of the action, a new coupé that the chief has purchased is delivered to the station. Curly rolls out the hose into the street. But in the process, the hoses are cut by a passing streetcar, with Curly starting to identify them after the first names of the young Dionne quintuplets. In frustration, Moe wrings Curly’s hands on the wringers.  Meanwhile, Curly sneaks out to visit his girlfriend Mayzie to celebrate her birthday despite the restrictions. She has two friends who need dates, so Curly tries to get Moe and Larry to join him. The two other girls are named Mimi and Minnie, the latter being tall, heavy set, and quite determined to secure a boyfriend. She even aggressively pursues a very reluctant Curly when it becomes apparent that the restrictions are going to prevent Moe and Larry from joining the party. Larry attempts to go anyway, but is stopped by Moe at the firepole by pulling his hair. Moe then goes to the stock room holding Larry by the hair, and locks the door to prevent Larry from leaving. But Larry fights back, and the key goes into the sink in the melee. Moe then proceeds to use Larry as a plunger to retrieve the key. Just then, Curly realizes that the only way he knows to get Moe and Larry out of the fire station is to pull a fire alarm, so he decides to activate it. The firemen respond to the call, but without Larry and Moe. Realizing the alarm, they force themselves out, and down through the firepole. They found that the firemen have left them, so they decided to use the coupé. They go to the alarm location, finding Curly and the three girlfriends waiting for them. Moe is irate by the false alarm, but sensing the approaching fire truck , all six then ride the coupé and go on a wild joyride, with Curly at the wheel, barely missing cars and streetcars. One unfortunate turn hits the car at a post, forcing them into the boot except for Moe who lands outside. Moe, assisted by concerned pedestrians, retrieves them out of the car, but with their egos bruised, the three girlfriends scoot off in a huff. However, before this happens, Minnie  gets into a comical face slapping match with Curly. The Stooges push the battered coupé out of the accident scene, but forgot to shut it off. The car goes in its own power in the street, back to the fire station. It goes out again, and the chief realizes that it is his car that is in trouble. The car ends up into an open Bekins van, and as they closed the door, the car explodes. The fire truck, with the irate captain, chases the Stooges. Sensing the chief, they escape in the van, smoking car and all.'] ['{{Plot}} The cartoon opens with Mammy Two Shoes mopping the kitchen floor. Right after she finishes, she is happy to have cleaned the entire house and hopes it will remain clean; unfortunately, it doesn\'t, as the camera cuts to Tom chasing Jerry outside, rounding a corner too wide and through a mud puddle, and then continuing the chase into the house. He runs into Mammy and she hits him with the mop, chastises him for making such a huge mess and forces him to mop the floor. As Tom finishes, Mammy goes out for shopping. She warns Tom not to make any mess in the house, otherwise he\'ll be thrown out: "If I find one spot of dirt in this house when I get back, we is gonna be minus one cat around here. Understand?" Tom nods his head in fright and Jerry, hiding behind a broom, also nods his head, ready as usual to take stock of the situation to sabotage Tom\'s efforts. After Mammy closes the door, Tom sticks his tongue out at her and makes a face, but she opens the door and points her finger at Tom, giving him a final warning to keep the place clean. Tom then nods again and kisses her finger, smiling politely, and satisfied, the maid leaves. For the rest of the cartoon, the mouse takes advantage of this conditional to torment the cat. Tom finishes the remainder of the cleaning, and relieved, Tom wipes the sweat off his forehead, but immediately has to clean this up in addition. A fly buzzes through the room and leaves dirt behind on one of the windows, so he has to wipe the window down to boot, but is shocked out of his wits to see Jerry busting in on the fun by deliberately scooping ashes from an ashtray onto the floor. Tom quickly grabs a broom and dustpan and cleans up the mess, but no sooner has he finished than the rodent is on the floor, holding the ashtray like a parade drum, and tripping the switch to dump more ashes onto the ground. Shocked and fed up, Tom angrily hurls a tomato at him, and Jerry ducks as the tomato splatters into the wall, creating an even bigger mess for Tom to clean. In apoplexy, the cat collects a bucket and starts to clean the wall, but as usual, he does not concentrate on the bucket and fails to spot Jerry deliberately ejecting blue ink from an ink pen into the bucket. Midway through cleaning up the tomato, Tom has created an identically sized mess of blue ink on the wall, and he realizes what has happened when he becomes aware that the water and towel are blue. In absolute dread, the cat covers his eyes and slowly peeks at his new mess, and then lifts his hand; his eyes exaggeratedly pop out and his jaw drops.  Soon he sees Jerry holding the ink pen, and he starts a new chase in complete rage, which quickly stops when the mouse threatens to squirt ink over the drapes. Smirking, he carries out this threat, but no ink escapes; apparently, the pen is empty. The cat, delighted, steals the pen and accidentally empties it onto the drapes. In horror, he grabs the drapes and runs them through the washing machine, the wringer, and the iron. Exhausted, the cat replaces the drapes and breathes out hoarsely. No sooner does this happen than Jerry has returned to his sabotage; this time, he deliberately juggles six eggs while walking a tightrope, forcing the cat to protect him in case he falls and, eventually, to catch the eggs when Jerry flings them across the room. In addition to juggling, Tom is forced to catch a cream pie on a fork using only his head, barely standing up. As the coup de grace, Jerry deliberately pulls the rug from under Tom, and although the cat recovers in time to snatch the egg carton and catch every egg in it, he forgets about the pie, which splatters onto his face. Having been humiliated again, Tom searches for Jerry, but shortly the mouse opens the front door for an old horse to walk into the house. Tom scares Jerry back out of the house as he quickly grabs the horse and throws him out , presumably doing away with Jerry in the process, and while his enemy is occupied with this, Jerry takes the opportunity to unknowingly re-enter the house through an electrical outlet marked Emergency Entrance, ready for another scheme. Tom goes to sleep, apparently rid of all threats. Meanwhile, Jerry pushes an ink stamp pad onto Tom\'s paws, and when the cat wakes up, he shuts the pad on Tom\'s nose before the cat can process what he sees; accordingly, Tom forgets about the stamp pad and chases the mouse. Jerry leads Tom on an off-screen chase through the entire house, and when the duo finally pulls back into view, Jerry stops the chase and points the cat to look at the gigantic mess of paw prints he must now clean up. Looking at his now ink-covered paws, Tom makes the connection and picks up the mouse, hurls him down the laundry chute, and races to clean the house before Mammy returns. Meanwhile, a truck full of coal has come to the house to make a delivery; Jerry grabs a rope and ties it to the delivery chute. On the verge of finishing the sanitizing job, Tom sees Mammy coming up the sidewalk; he hurriedly finishes, then stows the cleaning supplies behind the couch and sits down hopefully, ready for Mammy\'s return. Jerry pulls the delivery chute up to the living room such that the entire shipment of coal literally barges into the house , pushing Tom and then knocks Mammy down when she opens the front door. As soon as she digs her head out from the coal, she begins threatening to throttle Tom, despite the utter impossibility of Tom\'s cause for this new mess. Just then, Tom emerges in blackface. Thinking that he is a black man with information on Tom, Mammy asks him if he saw Tom. Tom, knowing that he is in trouble now, responds  that he hasn\'t: "No, Ma\'am! I ain\'t seen no cat around here! Uh uh! There ain\'t no cat, no place, no how! No MA\'AM!". Tom, meanwhile, walks away from the coal pile, but only his head is blackened, so Mammy finally sees through Tom\'s disguise. As she begins to angrily pelt coal angrily at Tom, he taunts her and tries to run away, but Mammy throws a piece of coal that is as large as a dive bomb into the distance and it ends up hitting Tom square on the head, knocking him out in an identical fashion to Tee for Two as the cartoon ends.'] ["This short showcases Pluto as a soldier.

Meanwhile, the bunny mob learns of the upcoming match-up and places all its bets on Bugs.  The race begins, and Bugs easily outpaces his reptilian rival. However, in his new get-up, the dim-witted gangsters mistake him for the turtle. Cecil reinforces this misconception by dressing in a gray rabbit suit and munching on a carrot.

Lois sits down in front of a nearby phone to call the police, and Clark exits the booth to follow after the imposter. Cracking the door open slightly on the roof and noticing the imposter, Clark says, "My double is in for some trouble." Seeing the police cars gather on the street below, the imposter heads back toward the door to the stairwell, where he is confronted by the real Superman. The imposter fires several rounds at Superman, to no avail. Out of bullets, the imposter becomes frightened, and walks backward as Superman approaches. He claims the Boss made him do it.

Superman swoops down to save him just in time. In the glow of the search lights, Lois and the police realize that the real Superman is not the criminal. Hoping for a lighter punishment, the imposter agrees to take Superman to his boss. Superman, without saying a thing, stands in front of the boss\' desk.

During the show, as Bugs is about to introduce Freep, he gets a telegram informing him that Freep is delayed by a storm and won\'t be able to appear until the next day. An angered Sam insists on seeing the high-diving act and forces Bugs at gunpoint to the top of a high-dive platform. But Bugs manages to pull out all his tricks and stops, and it is Sam who does all the diving, in a different comical setting nine separate times . 1: Sam pushes Bugs to the edge of the platform . Bugs dupes Sam into covering his eyes while he puts on his bathing suit, and then proceeds to spin the board around so that Sam is at the diving edge. Bugs makes it look like he\'s taken the dive , but Sam turns around and starts to walk off, right off the edge and into the tank, which falls apart with the water still intact. 2: Bugs springs on the board so hard that he sends Sam up, over and down . Bugs then realizes that he forgot to fill the tank with water, so he grabs a bucket of water from off-camera and throws it down from the diving board past Sam.

He visits his friend Piglet, who wears a scarf around his neck on this day. Piglet is blown into the air, his scarf unraveling all the while, and Pooh grabs hold of him. As they fly like a kite through the air over the other characters\' heads, Pooh wishes Kanga, Roo, Eeyore, Rabbit, and Owl a happy Winds-day. However, once they arrive at Owl\'s treehouse, he informs them that the wind is due to "a mild spring zephyr" rather than to a particular holiday. During the windstorm, Owl\'s house is knocked down, so Eeyore volunteers to house-hunt for Owl. That night, Pooh hears an unfamiliar growling noise coming from elsewhere in the Hundred Acre Wood. Someone knocks on Pooh’s door, then Tigger bounces inside in search of something to eat. He tries some honey but gets disgusted and decides, "Yuck! Tiggers don\'t like honey!". Before leaving Pooh\'s house, Tigger tells him that there are Heffalumps and Woozles in the forest that steal honey. After which, he says goodbye and bounces off. Pooh, frightened by Tigger\'s tale, takes it upon himself to guard his honey, but eventually falls fast asleep. As he is sleeping, he has a nightmare about Heffalumps and Woozles stealing his honey and chasing him around .

As the two birds start to fight, many others land on the wire and join in. They are interrupted when a very large, gangly, awkward-looking bird sitting on top of the pole honks to them. Soon, the small birds start mocking the large one by puffing up their feathers to resemble its plumage and imitating its honk. They then slide farther out along the wire and chatter suspiciously among themselves, ignoring the large bird's attempts to befriend them until it settles on the wire. However, its weight causes the wire to sag almost to the ground and all the small birds slide down toward it. As the large bird keeps trying to make friends, the small ones get annoyed and try to push it off the wire, only for it to hang upside down by its feet. The two nearest the center start pecking at its toes, egged on by the rest of the crowd. One of the other birds suddenly panics, realizing how low the wire is, and tries to stop the pecking. The others understand and stop too late; when the large bird's last toe slides off, the wire snaps upward and flings all the small birds out of sight. The large one is so close to the ground that it settles down easily, accompanied by a shower of feathers from the small birds. One of them falls to the ground, having lost all its feathers, and the large bird laughs and offers it a leaf to cover itself. The others soon tumble down as well and hide behind the large bird as it laughs even harder.

Worried that their food source is being "vandalized," they follow the truck to the barn so they can recover what they consider to be their food. After waiting for the farmer to leave, they run into the barn to reclaim their stolen property, but they spot Barnyard Dawg sleeping in front of the truck and retreat outside. As Tosh points out how they would never stand a chance against Dawg if he woke up, Mac explains that the best way is to take back the vegetables is get Dawg out of the barn and he has just the plan to do it. First, Mac lowers a big pot lid over Dawg so that Tosh spreads banana peels over the floor and whacks the lid with a mallet. Shaking from the vibrations, Dawg slips over the banana peels and straight into the water trough where he finds himself face to face with a deadpan pig. At this point, Tosh is eager to reclaim the vegetables, but Mac reminds him that Dawg will return, from which they will initiate Phase Two of their plan to wear him down psychologically. Sure enough, Dawg returns and looks in the mirror, but finding nothing wrong, just shrugs it off and goes back to sleep. The Goofy Gophers then carry out Phase Two, which involves Tosh taking a rope through the pulley of the well and tieing it to Dawg\'s tail while Mac ties the other end to a large hay bale.

The Goofy Gophers then initiate Phase Three of their plan . They saw a hole in the floor  and take Dawg to the pond, where they agree it will be a real shock for him. Sure enough, a duck in a bad mood swims up to Dawg and gives a rude quack, which startles Dawg into waking up and seeing his new surroundings. As Dawg begins to shake, the duck swims nervously away  and Dawg runs out of the pond screaming. Now completely shaking all over, Dawg takes out a box of Easy Doze It Sleeping Pills, of which he consumes the whole boxful and drops off to sleep. Once Dawg is fast asleep, as part of Phase Four, Mac wraps a girdle around him and ties it to a cord attached to a hot air balloon, which Tosh fills up with helium. As the balloon carries Dawg away, it snags on the pointed end of the barn roof and tears a hole in itself.

He turns around, but Tom turns around with him, still remaining out of Spike\'s eyesight, if not ears. Spike looks between his legs, at which point Tom climbs Spike\'s back so he can\'t be seen. Unfortunately, Tom\'s tail drops down into the dog\'s view, and Spike catches on. He chases after Tom, and the bicycle horns start squeaking again. Spike pauses the chase, instructing the cat to remove the horns from his feet; when the chase resumes, Tom successfully hides in a corner as Spike rushes off in the other direction, not knowing that Tom got away again. Jerry then turns the same corner as Tom, then retreats to Tyke\'s cradle; Tom throws out everything in the cradle, including Tyke, to search for the mouse, but Tyke wakes up first. Spike returns and Tom, after unsuccessfully trying to stifle Tyke\'s hiccups , runs away in fear. Spike tends to the hiccuping pup by giving him water, scaring him and popping a paper bag loudly, which all fail to solve the problem; eventually Spike ends up getting the hiccups too, threatening to kill Tom for it.

The parrot changes his tune, "Polly want a cracker! Polly want a cracker! Awk!" Bugs hands him a huge, lit firecracker, which promptly explodes, blasting all of his feathers off and leaves him dazed and smoldering. His last words before he faints are, "Me and my big mouth!" In a series of gags that mildly anticipate the Road Runner series, Bugs is in the crow\'s nest and Sam tries various unsuccessful attempts to get to him; for example, setting up a see-saw, standing on one end and tossing a rock on the other end, he springs straight up, crashes into the underside of the crow\'s nest, and falls back to the deck. In another one, that skirts the laws of physics, Bugs tells Sam he\'s going to jump. Instead, Bugs drops a convenient anvil over the side of the crow\'s nest, Sam catches it, and the entire ship  submerges. Sam mouths some apparent curses, then tosses the anvil over the railing and the ship resurfaces. At various times, Sam gets blasted by cannon fire, is subjected to the famous lots-of-doors in-and-out routine , and finally is tricked by Bugs into playing a "dare" game with matches that ends up exploding the pirate ship\'s powder magazine, reducing the ship to splinters. Finally, defeated, Sam raises the white flag. Bugsy turns to the audience, puts on an old-style ship captain\'s hat, and paraphrases John Paul Jones, "I had not even begun to fight!"'] ["{{Expand section}} Popeye is on a quest to find his missing father Poopdeck Pappy.

Bugs informs Elmer that it isn\'t rabbit season, but instead duck season. Daffy emerges, irate, and attempts to convince Elmer that Bugs is lying. Their conversation breaks down into Bugs leading Daffy to admit it is duck season by a number of verbal plays. Once Daffy admits it is duck season, Elmer fires his shotgun at Daffy, causing the duck to suffer a temporary setback before he comes back and tries again. This repeats multiple times during the short, with Daffy trying different ploys to get Elmer to shoot Bugs, but Bugs continues to outwit him. After Daffy is shot for the third time, he walks away. Elmer tries to shoot him, but his gun has no more bullets. Daffy is then thrilled, grabs Elmer\'s gun to make sure, but is shot in the face with the last bullet. Daffy then sees a sign that Bugs nailed to a tree saying "Duck Season Open". As he sees Elmer approaching, he disguises himself as Bugs, telling Elmer that it\'s \'Duck season\'.

Then he goes up to Bugs and says "You\'re desthpicable!" The 2 get out of their costumes as Daffy rants to Bugs how desthpicable he is. Bugs then begins to read duck recipes from a cookbook, and Daffy does the same with a rabbit recipe cookbook. Elmer tells them he\'s a vegetarian and only hunts for the sport of it. Although, in previous episodes, it has been stated that he was hunting Bugs for rabbit stew or the like. Outraged, Bugs comes in and claims "Oh, yeah? Well, there\'s other sports besides huntin\', ya know!?" Daffy then offers to play tennis. Elmer then begins shooting and chases both of them all the way to the rabbit hole. Bugs comes out of his hole and accuses Elmer of "hunting rabbits with an elephant gun". Bugs suggests Elmer shoot an elephant instead, but just as he is considering it a huge elephant appears, threatens Elmer and preemptively knocks him to the ground. Elmer finally loses patience and decides to take out both Bugs and Daffy. Daffy comes into the scene, dressed as a dog and Bugs comes in as a lady hunter. Elmer, however, sees through their disguise and threatens to shoot them. The cartoon climaxes when Elmer finds the two arguing by a tree with a sign that starts with the words "Rabbit Season"; Bugs and Daffy continue to pull off the sign to alternatively reveal it is "Duck Season" or "Rabbit Season" until they hit a final sign, proclaiming it to be "Elmer Season". The tables turned, Bugs and Daffy, dressed as hunters, begin to chase Elmer.'] ["Seeking winter shelter, the Pink Panther enters Zammo the Great's house while the magician is away, and the panther discovers a mischievous rabbit that leads him through a series of phantasmagorical phenomena, including a mobile door with stairs that change from ascending to descending, depending on what position the door is at in relation to the floor, a tilted will picture that, when straightened, causes the whole house to tilt, a deceptive, two-way mirror, and a subjective, psychedelic hole in the floor.

Meanwhile, an animator chooses to carry on with his work. In his drawing, he sketched a dungeon scene where Beans the Cat encounters a goblin. Weary for working several hours continuously, the animator decides to take a little snooze. Before ending the session, he draws a steel barricade between the two characters. Suddenly, the goblin comes to life and pulls him into the drawing. The goblin carries the animator away, heading somewhere beyond the picture's scene. Shocked and terrified, the animator tries in vain to break out of the goblin's grasp. He was then brought into a mystic chamber where stone portraits of various monsters are displayed on the walls. The monsters happened to be the animator's creations as well as those of his colleagues. They too came too life and got out of their illustrations. As revenge for how he and other cartoonists made them get subdued in the end of each film, the monsters gave the animator a pencil and forced him to draw a deep pit in the floor where they tossed him inside. Upon falling in, the animator holds onto a branch, trying to avoid being devoured by the crocodile at the bottom. Back at the scene still being worked on, Beans still stands behind the barricade, boredly waiting for his artist to come back. Just then, Little Kitty came to him, offering a lunchbox. Beans was expecting food but was a little surprised to find a saw in the container. Nonetheless, he uses it to cut his way out of the metal fence. Finally freeing himself, he goes around to find his animator. In no time, Beans found the chamber where his animator is being tormented. To intervene, he hurls a boot at the goblin, luring the monsters away as they try capture him. Beans managed to lose them somehow when he returns to the place to rescue the troubled man. The animator then receives a pencil from Beans and draws a ladder to climb out the pit. When the monsters are coming back, Beans spills lubricant between the room's entrance and the pit. The monsters slide on the lubricant mess and fall into the hole. To vanquish them for good, the animator removes the hole with an eraser. Beans and the animator shook hands for a work well done. It turns out what the animator went through was merely a dream as he was awaken by the custodian. To his relief, he finds the drawing on his desk unchanged. Not wanting to recall his experience, the animator edits out the goblin and the steel barricade, leaving only Beans in the picture. As a compliment to his little friend, he draws a platter with gelatin on top for Beans to eat."] ["A philandering husband's public flirtation with a beautiful girl -- and the resulting brawl with the woman's boyfriend -- are captured by a newsreel cameraman.

He lives with his wife, Arlene Square, and his curious granddaughter Hex, a hexagon. He rushes Hex to school and along the way they discuss the laws of inheritance: how each new generation of Flatlanders, beginning with triangles, gains a new side until the shapes become indistinguishable from circles. They also discuss how a citizen's shape affects their job, with triangles performing menial labor and circles ruling Flatland in the priest class. They witness a cruel incident where a Circle Priest arrests a slightly irregular octagon child, prompting Hex to yet again wonder about what happened to her pentagonal parents. Arthur tells her that he will tell her someday, and rushes her off to school. Arthur arrives at his Ministry of Regularity job only to be harassed by his circular superior, Miss Helios. He is about to confide his dream of the symbols to his brother Abbott Square when the employees are called to a meeting. The head circle ruler of Flatland, Pantocyclus, ushers a new edict that bans discussion of heretical topics such as a third dimension or the ruins at Area 33H. When Arthur sees an image of the ruins, he recognizes them from his dream. At dinner, Hex asks Arthur about the Circles' proclamation and to define 'dimension.' Arthur gives her a geometry lesson showing how powers in arithmetic can be translated to geometrical dimensions. When Hex speculates on a third dimension, Arthur becomes infuriated and sends her to her room. She is only calmed when Arlene talks to her and gives her a gift of some of her mother's belongings – a box containing books and a model of the symbols at Area 33H. That night, Arthur Square is plucked from his bedroom and taken to a strange, alien landscape. He encounters the insane, babbling King of Pointland, a being of zero dimensions. Then he encounters Lineland, a universe of one dimension that is populated by an arrogant line segment King who cannot imagine a new dimension that he cannot see. Finally, Arthur is whisked back to his living room. Suddenly he hears a voice booming out and sees a point grow to a circle and then back to a point. The being identifies himself as Spherius, a three-dimensional solid from Spaceland. After failed attempts to explain the third dimension, Arthur is popped into Spaceland and taken on a journey by Spherius. They stop at Area 33H and Arthur realizes that the symbols show a progression from point to line to square to cube, and that the constantly changing shape in the center is actually a cube, halfway though the plane of Flatland and spinning along all three axes. Hex was right! Arthur excitedly asks Spherius to show him the fourth dimension and the fifth dimension. Spherius laughs, saying there couldn't possibly be a higher dimension. He tells Arthur to spread the word of the third dimension and drops Arthur back into bed. Meanwhile, at the Ministry, Pantocyclus is ordering the triangle guards and circles, including Miss Helios, to beware any employees who mention the third dimension and to guard Area 33H. When Arthur awakes, he rushes to Hex's room to tell her the news. He finds her missing and Arlene tells him that she left very early. Meanwhile, Hex is entering Area 33H and discovering the symbols for herself. However, a triangle guard spots Hex. At the Ministry, Arthur arrives and begins talking to his brother when an alarm goes off. Over the intercom Miss Helios orders all guards to catch an intruder at Area 33H. Arthur realizes it might be Hex at the ruins and persuades Abbott to help him steal a Ministry car. Abbott and Arthur arrive at the ruins moments before the triangle guards. With Abbott distracting the guards, Arthur goes to the symbols and finds Hex terrified. She apologizes but Arthur finally admits to her that he had been protecting her from the knowledge that her parents were arrested and killed for their theories on the third dimension. With the guards closing in, Arthur pushes Hex into the cube symbol, which pops her up into the third dimension. Arthur is arrested by Miss Helios. Arthur is hastily brought into a courtroom with Pantocyclus proceeding over his trial for heresy. Arlene arrives, asking where Hex is. In his cell, Arthur assures her that Hex escaped 'upward' into the third dimension and is safe. A nearby pentagon begins broadcasting the trial. Pantocyclus challenges Arthur to show everyone the third dimension, or as he calls it “upwards, not northwards.” Arthur admits that he can't and pleads with his fellow Flatlanders that reason dictates a third dimension. He challenges them to aspire to be greater than their shapes, angering the Circles immensely. The crowd is growing unruly as Arthur's words take hold. In a fit of rage, Pantocyclus sentences Arthur to death and the crowd gasps. Just as Arthur loses hope, Spherius interrupts the proceedings and pops Arthur out of Flatland. Arthur thanks Spherius but feels he has failed to persuade people of the third dimension. Spherius surprises Arthur with the solution: he intended Hex, not Arthur to be the prophet of the Third Dimension. Hex embraces Arthur and they fly back down to the courtroom, surprising everyone as they materialize out of nowhere. The Circles are speechless and lose control of the courtroom, evading the reporter's questions about the third dimension. Arthur, Arlene, Hex, and Abbott are reunited. The reporter asks Hex if she has also visited the fourth dimension. Spherius angrily comes down to Flatland to scoff at the idea and flies off. But off on the horizon, a light is shining. The symbols at Area 33H are glowing and as the camera dips below Flatland we see that the spinning cube is actually part of a larger installation: eight cubes spinning and orbiting a 4D cube – a tesseract – which, in turn, is rotating around its fourth axis."] ['An American doctor, Dr. Nicholas Pinter , working in Chechnya for Doctors Beyond Borders, is mistakenly identified as a secret agent by the Russian mob.

Quacker unconvinced, sets off on his travels, even though he cannot fly. After about some hard running, Quacker is out of breath, and Jerry again shows his friend the book. Quacker won't to give up, loads himself into a catapult and flies straight into Tom's mouth. Quacker flees and Tom peeks at a recipe for duck, then sets out to make this reality. Jerry pulls Quacker into a tree as he passes by. Soon Quacker places himself on one end of a seesaw and drops an anvil on the other to pelt himself into the air, but cannot stay up and falls into a frying pan Tom sticks out of the window. Tom covers Quacker with egg and flour, which blinds the duck temporarily. When he recovers and sees the cooking book, the recipe reads SOUTHERN FRIED DUCK, and Quacker realizes right away that Tom wants to eat him! Jerry scoops up Quacker from the pan with a spatula and pulls it towards his hole, but drops the duck just in front. Tom grabs the duck, but gets his hand hit by the spatula and loses Quacker. Still persistent, the duck rides a rocket reading FLORIDA OR BUST into the distance, but Tom swallows the rocket to stop the duck from escaping, sending him across the landscape into a pool - all without swallowing Quacker.  Knowing he cannot escape alone, Quacker pleads for help from Jerry, who obliges after much pestering. The duck boards an air balloon and Jerry fills it up, sending Quacker floating into the air. This does not last long as Tom shoots the balloon from a hidden bunker and brings out a net to catch the duck. While the cat is focused on watching his prey's trajectory, Jerry cuts the bottom of the net out and takes Quacker. Finally the mouse and duck go to the international airport and fly to Miami, Florida. Tom chases them into the airport and tries to run away from the oncoming plane, and he ends up stowing away by clinging to the wheel. On a Miami beach, Quacker and Jerry are sunbathing, glad to be rid of Tom, but he is actually right behind them and traps them under a bucket. Quacker is screaming in panic from beneath the bucket, as Tom, who clearly intends to harm his victims, snickers evilly and pulls down an umbrella to hide himself and the bucket as the end appears on the umbrella."] ['Although Spanky would like to play football with the rest of the gang, he is stuck at home taking care of his baby sister.

The story begins with a serial killer bumping off the residents of a small Somerset community. Maverick DI Barry Stern is assigned to the case and - despite his reluctance - is partnered with by-the-book fellow DI Mike Tight. On their first time out together Barry shoots a dealer trying to sell him cocaine in a public toilet. Meanwhile the killer stalks a woman home from the supermarket and kills her by electrocution with a kitchen light. Mike and Barry show up at the scene of the crime and discover the woman bludgeoned to death. A box of cereal has been left on her head leading Barry to summise that they are now looking for a cereal killer. Back at the precinct Mike addresses his fellow inspectors. He tells them that in order to catch the killer they must look at and obey the formula that most cop movies go by even though it is a British movie and there won\'t be any car chases. Barry points out that the partner usually dies in these kind of movies but Mike says he is thinking more along the lines of the Lethal Weapon films. The following day the police stakeout the local supermarket where they expect the killer to strike next. Barry is disguised as a mime. Mike is disguised an old lady in order to ensnare the killer. A small boy asks Barry for a mime. Barry gives him the finger that leads to him getting beaten up by the boy\'s elder brother.  Meanwhile Mike proceeds to the local park followed by the killer. Once there he realizes he is being followed and radios for help but it\'s too late. The killer attacks Mike and stabs him. Barry arrives on bike to find Mike dying. Mike says he loves Barry and gets him to give him a final kiss. Before he dies he tells him to look in the script to see where the killer is hiding out. Barry arrives at a creepy looking house. There he is captured by the killer and tied to a chair. Barry says he knows who he is and proceeds to tell him his back-story: The killer is Philip Quinn. As a child he was made to eat cereal every day. He couldn\'t do it and in later years developed an inferiority complex about it. He then murdered his parents with a Black and Decker jigsaw and inherited their estate. He surrounded himself with waifs-and-strays that, like him, were hooked on cereal and slowly built up an army of hockey stick carrying box-men. He got a job at the local supermarket to satisfy his desire for cereal but he couldn\'t stand it when people would buy it for themselves and so he would follow them home and murder them. Philip leaves Barry under the watchful eye of his beautiful sister Antonia. She seduces him and ten seconds later they are lying in bed together post-coitus. Barry handcuffs her to the chair and makes his escape. Outside Barry encounters one of the box-men. He manages to defeat him by jumping on his face, which blows up. Meanwhile Antonia sounds the alarm which summons a whole army of box-men. They chase him into a room that turns out to be an armoury. He tools-up and proceeds outside to face his adversaries. A gun battle ensues during which Barry discovers that one of the box-men is MI5 undercover agent Nigel Roscoe. The pair join forces to fend off the box-men. After a lengthy action sequence they manage to slaughter the army leading to much splatter and carnage. However by this point Antonia has escaped and she hurls a knife into Nigel\'s back killing him. Barry shoots Antonia in the head. Back at the supermarket Philip is working. Barry turns up to catch him but DI Jackson is waiting there to take Barry in. Barry subdues Philip but when Jackson interferes Barry lets Philip go in order to recapture him elsewhere. He tells Jackson not to follow him and lays chase. In the local park Philip takes Edgar the director hostage and kills him. Barry breaks character, grabs a passing extra and gets her to direct the rest of the film. Barry corners Philip in a playground. The pair have a showdown where they fight it out one-on-one.

Disillusioned with the police he throws his badge away before riffling through his pockets and pulling out a pin, a police radio and a grenade.

While on the street he sees a discarded newspaper advertisement from a ranch in Wyoming, requesting a "cow-puncher." He applies, and, while there, goes through various training exercises, but fails them all. Egghead, having seen his apparent uselessness, begins to leave, but the lead cowboy decides to give him a job: cleaning up after the cows and horses.'] ['The film opens with a "toot-toot" and a train is seen chugging down the tracks, whistling ever so often. The front wheels turn into a pair of hands, that manually squeeze the whistle in order to make a distinct honking sound. The scene then moves to a boxcar at the back of the train, where Bosko is singing and dancing, accompanied by a banjo playing pig. They are quite jolly until Bosko starts a mournful rendition of Cryin\' for the Carolines, at which the pig starts to cry. Suddenly Bosko and the pig are thrown towards the back of the boxcar. The pig seems to be out cold whilst Bosko looks around, trying to understand what is going on. Bosko tries to revive the pig but is unsuccessful. The scene pans to show that the train is climbing a hill, which explains the tilted boxcar. The train straightens itself at the top of the hill but then goes over a bridge, which bends exaggeratedly to accommodate its weight. Through a tunnel and then uphill again at almost a ninety degree angle, the train is now exhausted and starts panting as it begins to slow down. It then starts crawling like a giant caterpillar, curling and uncurling itself as it moves up the hill. Just a few feet from the summit, the train reaches out its wheels cum hands in an attempt to get a handhold but as it grabs the mountain, we see a part of the hillside peeling away and displaying spotted underwear. The mountain, using tree trunks as hands, reaches back and pulls up its pseudo-pants, looking quite angry as it does so. The train now begins to haul itself up using the railroad as a rope, manages to reach the top and goes over. However, the last boxcar breaks free and races back down the steep slope. Bosko lifts a small hatch in the roof and looks out frantically. His head gets knocked off by an overhanging sign and is left bouncing by itself on the roof. His headless body then climbs onto the roof and manages to reattach his head. Next the boxcar splits in two and Bosko is left with one foot on each side, balancing precariously over the speeding vehicle. Oddly enough, we do not see any sign of the banjo playing pig inside the split boxcar, which eventually comes back together. The boxcar continues to split and come together in this fashion several times. At one point, Bosko lengthens his neck, twists it into a winch of sorts and uses it to haul the boxcar pieces back together. The next tunnel is so low that Bosko gets thrown off the roof and tumbles down the outside of the tunnel, falling astride a cow at the other end. The cow starts galloping down the railtrack and Bosko gets thrown off as they enter another tunnel. He tumbles over it and ends up back on the roof of the boxcar which is now speeding along just behind the running cow. The boxcar goes over a bump and Bosko gets thrown off again, only to grab the edge of a pipe attached to the roof, which detaches from the side of the boxcar and drags Bosko along, bumping him hard against the ground. Bosko is then dragged through several trees and electricity poles when he eventually hits a bump in the road and gets thrown back onto the roof of the boxcar, which breaks and drops him inside. The cow sees a tree and comes to halt, causing the boxcar to flatten it against the tree. The cow then unravels itself, in the manner of an accordion and walks away, whilst pieces of the shattered boxcar rain down including Bosko and the pig, who fall onto a flat, open wagon. The pig opens an umbrella to shield them from the falling debris. When the pig finally puts his umbrella away, assuming that the debris has stopped falling, one last piece falls directly on his head. This gives him a large bump and he starts to cry. Bosko dries his tears and pushes off down the track on the little wagon. He starts playing the banjo and singing as the pig cheers up and starts to sing along with him. They disappear into a tunnel as we see the closing credits.'] ['Stan and Ollie play door-to-door Christmas tree salesmen in California.

The builder turned to him and Kozyavin asked him, but he didn't hear anything he said close his ears. The builder took a little red flag from his suit and waved with it, until every builder stopped to work, and even the machines. Kozyavin asked one more time, if he sawed Sidorov. After a surprising action, he walked further to search Sidorov. An active ramp in the building site, which workedintermittently up and down, didn't frighten up Kozyavin. Without taking any break, Kozyavin continued to walk. On a fair, he walked upon a pole. The children, which were amazed about his acrobatic skills, were asked by Kozyavin. After no reaction by them, the employee Kozyavin pursued his way with a optimistic view to comply the task. The second person Kozyavin met was a violinist, which currently played a composition. Kozyavin asked the violinist, if he saw Sidorov. Without any response, Kozyavin nudged him and took his violin bow. Walking on surrealistic stairs, he opened the door to a commission building. Kozyavin sparked a light and went through paintings and antique and finally saw two people, which looked like thieves. Kozyavin was oblivious, that they were going to swipe the whole items in this building. However, Kozyavin touched one of the man's shoulder and asked the same question said before. Surprised, they attended with Kozyavin by giving the alleged right turn to Sidorov. Early next day he pursued the same direction. He entered a pipeline on ground, which curves were unrealistically smoothed by Kozyavin himself. He jumped from the pipeline onto the ground and treaded a drought veld. Convinced to meet with Sidorov, Kozyavin went throughout the veld, until he climbed up to a mountain. With a good sight, he watched everything around him. Unfortunately he didn't find anyone and continued to move forward. He arrived a desert and got a view to a giant skeleton of a prehistoric animal. Walking through the backbone like a stair, he sawed an archaeologist, who currently researched the skeleton, and asked him the common question. With no reply and no regret about the destroyed skeleton by the archaeologist, Kozyavin continued walking. A body of stagnant water didn't block him to accomplish the task the boss gave him, so Kozyavin swam, until he reached the Antarctica. Kozyavin walked around the world, until he arrived his office. Kozyavin didn't accomplish his boss' accomplishment to find Sidorov. Kozyavin answered it with a shrug and went back to his working room."] ["When Alfalfa, Spanky, Buckwheat, and Porky are bored with school, they decide to play sick the next day and leave a note on Miss Jones' , desk so that they could go to the circus that has arrived in town.

His pursuit of this mythical geometric concept tears his marriage apart. The film is interspersed with flashbacks showing Phil\'s great-great grandfather discovering the same mysteries of the supernatural side of geometry as Phil is uncovering by reading the diaries.

Thirteen days into the journey, Porky is writing in the Ship\'s Log that he is nearing land, "...I hope, I hope, I hope". A fish spots the Petunia coming his way and swims to the bottom of the ocean to tell his friends and says, "Hey guys, a ship is coming through!"  and they all swim to near the surface, just under the boat. A swordfish comes along and cuts a hole in the bottom of the boat and all of Porky\'s goods fall to the bottom of the ocean! As Porky falls out too, the swordfish pushes him back into the boat and closes up the hole. The swordfish unscrews his "sword" from his face, and gives it to a nearby fish to stand guard . Out of the sinking goods falls a lunchbox and when it hits bottom, opens up to form a canteen where a fish inside wearing a chef\'s hat is flipping burgers. A group of seahorses see a record player and as it starts playing, they swim onto the rotating record and form a merry-go-round. Smaller fish jump on their backs, imitating children on a ride. A fish swallows a teapot which whistles a tune while emitting steam and the opening and closing of the lid. Another fish swallows a clock with a moving pendulum and as he walks away, the pendulum keeps swinging. As Porky lifts the hole cover to see what happening , he gets water squirted in his face by the sentry fish. Another fish swallows a radio and as the radio announcer  is speaking, the fish looks around for someone speaking and does not realize the sound is coming from the radio. The announcer describes how two giant bombers dropped a bomb on a small village, and the fish goes through all the motions of the bombing and gunfire sounds . As the shelling comes to a stop, the fish wipes sweat from his brow, only to have a program called "Gangsta Busters" begin playing including the sounds of bombing and gunfire, and goes through all the motions again until he is bounced off the ocean floor which causes the radio to be up-chucked. Bowls and boxes are the next to follow, forming a hotel with a ballroom inside. Two electric eels swim by and form the marquee "Holly" and "wood" above the entrance and begin blinking on and off. Two other fish enter with flashlights on forming spotlights, as seen in front of hotels and theaters with big events and movie premiers in Hollywood that were common at the time. Two other fish have bowler hats drop on them, and as they turn toward the camera, acquire a likeness of Laurel and Hardy, and they swim into the Hotel. Another fish steps into some large shoes, and impersonates a Greta Garbo character and she says, "I want to be alone", a line in the 1932 classic Garbo movie "Grand Hotel". Another fish swallows an hourglass lamp and takes on the likeness of Mae West, complete with jewels and parasol, utters, "Come up and see me sometime" as she steps into the Hollywood Legion Stadium to watch a boxing match. There are two boxing fish fighting on the keys of a typewriter in the stadium, and as the carriage comes to the end of the line, the typewriter\'s ding is heard, and each fish backs into his own corner, and another fish pushes the carriage back to the beginning of a new line. The keys spell out what is happening in the fight. Back to Porky, he\'s now frowning because all of his goods have been lost, and puts a worm on a hook and lowers it into the water. The sentry fish sees this and pulls out his own fishing pole with baited hook and the worm jumps onto the hook and the sentry fish reels him in and eats him! Later, the ballroom guests are partying and waving their drinking glasses around when a spotlight appears on the curtain. As the curtain rises, we see some pretty dancing legs and as the curtain rises further, it turns out to be a 10-legged octopus! The Mae West fish dances with something resembling a walrus or seal; her bustline and his waistline fit together perfectly as they dance. The fish that swallowed the clock stands still as his hips move to the beat of the music. A whale appears under Porky\'s boat and the sentry fish knocks on the hole cover. As Porky opens the cover and says, "Who\'s there?" the whale spouts water from his blowhole, which forces Porky back onto the boat. A waterspout appears in the moonlit evening sky and as we see the dancing fish again, the announcer comes on and says there\'s a waterspout approaching the Boola-Boola islands. The fish casually go back to their dancing until he says, "Well, come on you guys, SCRAM!" and all of the fish panic and run for their lives. The force of the waterspout picks up all of the goods and drops them back into the Petunia, and Porky sails off into the distance. The sentry fish spits water, and Porky comes back and sprays him with a spritzer-bottle, and the fish starts crying and the cartoon comes to a close.'] ["The film starts with an aerial image of a boy rowing a boat on the Ottawa River. The movement then freezes and view slowly zooms out, revealing more of the landscape all the time. The continuous zoom-out takes the viewer on a journey from Earth, past the Moon, the planets of the Solar System, the Milky Way and out into the far reaches of the known universe. The process is then reversed, and the view zooms back through space to Earth, returning to the boy on the boat. It then zooms in to the back of the boy's hand, where a mosquito is resting.

The only notable additions are the addition of color , the early appearance of the Grinch\'s dog Max, and the insertion of three songs: the Christmas carol "Welcome Christmas" , the polka-styled "Trim Up the Tree," and "You\'re a Mean One, Mr. Grinch" . Almost all narrations are made verbatim from the book. Also added are a description of the noise-making Whos on Christmas morning and the substitution of nonsensical Seuss-like gifts such as "bizzle-binks" instead of the mundane gifts such as bicycles and popcorn. A sequence in which the Grinch and Max advance from the mountain to Whoville with comical difficulty on Christmas Eve, with no spoken parts, was added to stretch the length of the special to a full half-hour. The Grinch  is the film\'s main character. He lives in a cave atop the fictional Mt. Crumpit, located above Whoville. The Grinch is a surly character with a heart "two sizes too small" who has especially hated Christmas for 53 years. The film opens on Christmas Eve with the Grinch wishing he could stop Christmas Day from coming to Whoville. When he sees his dog, Max, covered in snow in a Santa Claus-like way, the Grinch decides to disguise himself as Santa and steal Christmas. The Grinch makes himself a Santa coat and hat and disguises the innocent Max as a reindeer. He loads empty bags onto a sleigh and travels to Whoville with some difficulty. In the first house he is almost caught by Cindy Lou Who , a small Who girl who wakes up and sees him taking the Christmas tree. Pretending to be Santa, the Grinch tells Cindy Lou that he is merely taking the tree to his workshop for repairs, and then sends her back to bed. He empties the first house of all the food and Christmas-related items, then repeats the process at the other houses in Whoville. He also takes the village decorations. With the Whos\' stolen Christmas goods, the Grinch and Max travel back up Mt. Crumpit. Before dropping the loaded sleigh off the mountain, the Grinch waits to hear a sad cry from the Whos. However, down in the village, the Whos joyously begin to sing Christmas carols, proving that the spirit of Christmas does not depend on material things. The Grinch begins to understand the true meaning of Christmas, though he barely does so in time to prevent the stolen treats from going over the cliff and while he tries to stop the sleigh from falling off, his heart grows three sizes—granting him "the strength of TEN Grinches, plus two!" He brings everything back to the Whos and participates in the holiday feast. He is given the honor of carving the roast beast, while Max gets the first slice for himself for all his troubles.'] ["The film begins with a blissful wedding, but the young couple union explodes when a fit of jealousy unhinges Sandra and Lonnie's world.

At this point the film switches to animation, with the shadow of a now-animated emcee  continuing to introduce the Oscar, and Bugs  assuring the viewer that "it\'s in da bag; I\'m a cinch to win". Bugs is stunned when the award goes instead to James Cagney . Shock turns to anger as Bugs declares the results to be "sa-bo-TAH-gee" and demands a recount. Bugs then tries to make his case by showing clips from Hiawatha\'s Rabbit Hunt  as proof of his allegedly superior acting . He hurls a set of film cans off-screen and tells someone named "Smokey" to "roll \'em!"According to IMDB, this is a reference to Schlesinger cameraman/projectionist Henry "Smokey" Garner. Director Bob Clampett later confirmed this in a later 1969 Funnyworld magazine interview. That small clip is now used frequently in the special features for the first volume of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection. Bugs tells the audience that these are some of his "best scenes". Immediately a "stag reel"  starts to roll, and the startled Bugs quickly stops it and switches to the right film. Finally, he pleads with the audience, "What do you say, folks? Do I get it? Or do I get it?" (echoing Fredric March\'s drunken appeal to the Academy Award banquet audience in [[A Star Is Born .

Unable to find anything worth his while  he spots a refrigerator inside a house and heads for it. He sneaks onto the property only to wake a sleeping bulldog. The bulldog chases the cat up to the side of the house. The cat quickly pulls out some sleeping pills, putting the dog into a deep sleep. Once inside the cat searches for food in the kitchen, but comes up empty. His luck finally changes when he finds a can of cat food. He quickly opens the can and out of the can pops a mouse who is plopped down onto a dinner plate. The cat is about to dig in with a fork but the mouse puts a quick stop to that. He says that the cat can\'t eat him because he has already seen the cartoon they are in and that he winds up saving the cat\'s life later. The feline understands but wants some food as he is starving. The mouse points into the other room and tells him that there is a huge, fat, tasty canary in there. The cat charges out into the other room and stuffs the unseen canary into a sack heading back to the kitchen. The bird is emptied from the sack, to be revealed as a scrawny little thing. The bird tells the cat, "Well, I\'ve been sick..." Desperate, the cat gets a  brainstorm when he sees a bottle of Jumbo-Gro plant growth formula on the shelf. Quickly he pours some of the formula into the bird and sure enough, the canary grows rapidly in size. But before the cat can take a bite, the bird is already over 10 feet tall. The canary takes advantage of his new height and beats up on the cat. The cat turns the tables on the bird and drinks the Jumbo-Gro formula himself, doubling in size until he is much bigger than the bird. He tosses the potion out of the window only for it to land in the bulldog\'s mouth. While the now giant-sized cat chases the slightly smaller canary through the side of the house, the bulldog guzzles down the formula. After a quick run around the block, the cat and canary wind up back outside of the house, where a now gigantic bulldog appears before them. The cat runs away in fear as the bulldog tosses the bottle of plant growth food down the chimney, where it rolls out of the fireplace and straight to the mouse inside the house. The dog leaps over the house and chases the cat into the city. The mouse in the house takes a few sips of plant food, instantly ballooning to gigantic size. The dog chases the cat to the city, only for the now gargantuan mouse to show up and scare the bulldog away with a simple "Boo!". The mouse who is as tall as a 20 story building and just as fat, reminds the cat that he told him he would save his life. The cat thanks him as the mouse hands him the bottle back and waddles off. The cat, rubs his enormous belly realizing he still is hungry, sees the huge mouse stomping off and gets another idea.

They wave goodbye to the viewers as the camera pulls back, revealing that they have outgrown the Earth itself and are standing atop the globe.'] ["{{Plot}} A baby elephant named Jumbo falls from a passing train into a house and as misfortune would have it, into Tom's basket. Jumbo hides himself with Tom's blanket as Tom stretches and goes to sleep. Tom pushes part of Jumbo down such that his trunk is showing, but Jumbo pulls it back such that Tom  pays no attention. Now clear, Jumbo steps out of the basket and runs around with Tom on top of him, causing the cat to bump his head on a cabinet. Tom is confused, but goes back to sleep in his basket again. Jumbo is revealed to have strong suction; he can draw things towards him by contracting his trunk. He demonstrates this by sucking up all of Tom's milk from 15 feet away, waking the cat up again. As Tom storms into the kitchen after Jerry, Jumbo hides. Jerry just happens to be stealing milk from the refrigerator, and a drop of milk falls from his whisker, leading Tom to believe Jerry has stolen his milk. Jerry denies it, but Tom moves to smash Jerry with the milk bowl, ultimately failing when Jumbo sucks Jerry away just in time. Tom is puzzled and walks away as Jumbo and Jerry shake on it. Wanting to further please his new friend, Jerry climbs to a bag of peanuts by standing on Jumbo and retrieving it from the cabinet, but it breaks over Jumbo's head and wakes Tom up for a third time. Jumbo flees, summoning Jerry with his suction, into a closet, before Tom sees him. Tom does, however, see the evidence. Meanwhile, Jumbo sucks the peanuts under the door, frightening the cat and leading him towards the door. As Tom attempts to force entry, Jerry paints Jumbo and turns him into a lookalike of Jerry. They then unlock the door for the cat, and Tom is met with hammers from both Jerry, and then a second time from Jumbo, when he opens the door.  Tom is puzzled and peeks inside when he opens the door again. When Jumbo is seen on the other side, Tom shuts the door in an instant. Tom grabs a baseball bat, looking to beat up Jumbo, but instead gets his foot smashed by Jerry again. The fourth time Tom opens the door, he is met by Jumbo. Due to his size, he faces the cat down and then punches Tom with his trunk, throwing the cat into a desk. Tom returns to the door and opens it for a fifth time, taking shelter behind the door and waiting....but nothing. Then, though, he is snapped back to attention by a crashing noise, and chases Jerry through the halls. He runs back and forth and sees a huge Jerry on the other side . Tom is curious, and runs across a second time, and sees Jerry. He sighs with relief, and for confirmation, runs across a third time and sees only Jerry, but changes direction and this time, sees Jerry and Jumbo. Tom starts to get confused and pokes his head over the wall. The first time it is Jumbo; then Jerry, then Jumbo, then Jerry. When he runs towards Jerry's mousehole and sees a huge mousehole next to Jerry's, Tom figures out the situation and yells in fright. There is already a mousetrap near Jerry's hole, and Tom puts a large mousetrap near Jumbo's hole and runs off. Unfortunately for the cat, Jumbo is on the ball, and turns the trap around and activates his suction. Tom peeks back and gasps as he gets closer to the trap, but he is unable to break away from the suction, and gets caught in the trap. Tom lets out a super loud scream and looks at his tail, which is in the form of a bump. Now, the chases after Jerry, who runs into another mousehole. Tom gropes for Jerry's tail, but Jumbo sticks his out instead. Tom loses control of Jumbo's weight and tumbles onto the stairs with Jumbo on top of him. With everything else exhausted, Tom attempts to shoot the baby elephant, and just misses Jerry in the attempt. Jumbo hides, leading to Tom going after Jerry with the gun. Just then, Jumbo's mother pokes her head through the window and hugs her son. When she sees more shots narrowly miss Jumbo, she scoops him up as Tom continues to shoot at Jerry. Jerry runs outside and sees Jumbo in the garage with a paintbrush, motioning for Jerry to join him. Tom follows the mouse towards the garage and points the gun forward. Jerry jumps out, followed by Jumbo and his mother, decked out in mouse colors too. Upon seeing this terrifying display, Tom's gun droops down as if it were a piece of spaghetti and the cat, , mimicking the sizes of Jerry and the two elephants, and then runs off manically with breaking fences."] ["The White Man and his dog enters the little island in the middle of the ocean; then all of a sudden, the dog's tail points at the top of the tree and the White Man looks up and sees that big muscle person on top of the coconut tree, so the White Man uses his rifle and shoot the muscle person out of the tree, then coconuts hit his head.

Bugs famously declares he "shoulda make a left toin at Albuqoique". As he asks the matador for directions, the matador escapes into the stands, leaving Bugs to fend for himself against Toro. After irritating Bugs and getting a slap for "steaming up my tail," Toro chalks up the points of his horns like a pool cue and rams the rabbit out of the bullring. As he sails into the air, Bugs mutters his famous line from Groucho Marx: "Of course you realize, dis means war". Toro takes his applause for claiming his latest victim , but it is short-lived because Bugs re-enters the bullring in matador garb. Bugs defeats Toro using an anvil hidden behind his cape. While Toro is still dazed from his collision, Bugs makes the bull follow the cape up to a bull shield, accompanied by a lively underscore of "La Cucaracha", where his horns pierce it. Bugs bends the horns down like nails and, thinking he\'s got him at bay, makes fun of Toro using puns . Unaware that the bull can detach his horns and strike back, Toro proceeds to bash Bugs in the head, which knocks him unconscious. While Toro sharpens his horns, Bugs interrupts him by placing an elastic band around the horns and using it as a giant slingshot to smack him in the face with a boulder. Toro charges back at Bugs, right in the buttocks. Bugs then returns, this time in a large sombrero doing a little dance and slapping Toro on the face in tempo to the tune of "Las Chiapanecas". Toro tries to punch him twice but is slapped each time. Bugs dances more and then disappears under the sombrero, but not before honking Toro\'s nose. While Toro once again sharpens his horns , Bugs has prepared a booby trap for the bull, composed of a double-barreled shotgun hidden behind the cape. Toro charges towards the cape, and somehow the shotgun previously in Bugs\'s hand enters Toro\'s body and stops at his tail, firing a bullet from one of Toro\'s horns when he flicks his tail  on the ground. Now having the upper hand, Toro chases Bugs shooting at the hare, but Toro eventually runs out of bullets. Toro "reloads" by swallowing several "elephant bullets" , but when he attempts to test-fire he instead explodes, gun and all. Bugs taunts Toro once again by calling him, among other things, an "imbecile"  and an "ultra maroon," but realizes that he is cornered by the bull behind barred gates. Awaiting certain death , Bugs miraculously opens the gates like a garage door, sending Toro out of the bullring and into the horizon. Toro runs back to the bullring, not anticipating that Bugs has laid out a Rube Goldberg–like contraption of axle grease, a ramp, and some platforms on the bull\'s path. The grease and ramp send Toro airborne over some glue, a sheet of sandpaper, a protruding matchstick, and a barrel of TNT which explodes when Toro flies by. Still in the air and in shock, Toro finally crashes into a wooden bull shield. The cartoon ends with the unconscious bull\'s hindquarters sticking out of the shield, and the victorious Bugs holding up the cape with the words "THE END" etched on it.'] ['The film opens at an emergency telephone exchange, which receives a request for an ambulance once every 3½ minutes.

Far from the parade route, on what would appear to be the wrong side of the peppermint stick railroad tracks, a gingerbread drifter overhears an impoverished sugar cookie girl crying. Upon hearing that she cannot enter the parade because she hasn\'t any pretty clothes, he hurries to remedy this, concocting a dress of colored frosting and candy hearts. He covers her brown hair with golden taffy ringlets and adds a large violet bow to her dress as a finishing touch. Thus attired, she is entered as the final contestant in the parade: Miss Bonbon. The judges, who have thus far been disappointed in the candidates, all promptly declare Miss Bonbon the Cookie Queen on sight.

The duckling suddenly stops when the anvil gets stuck between two small trees, and Tom sees his chance to kill the duck when the anvil bursts free and crashes into Tom sending him flying backwards into a water pump. The duckling then succeeds in getting in the air, but is held down by the weight of the anvil. Since the duckling cannot go anywhere, Tom shoots at the duck, but instead breaks the rope.

Then, he finds Humphrey with a few fishing nets and rods, and asks him what he is doing; when the bear responds in his own unintelligible "bear-speak," the ranger commands him, "Go fish like a bear!"

When the ranger gets to the lake to dump the fish, he finds Humphrey in there, trying to eat one of the small fishes, which is then consumed by a much larger fish. Humphrey tries to remove the small fish from the belly of the large fish , and the bear clutches five other large fishes that jump out of the water, but then Woodlore appears to measure the fish, while at the same time punishing Humphrey by hitting him in the head with his boat and sinking him into the depths of the lake. When Humphrey grabs the fish  and emerges from the lake, he discovers a fish larger than any of the others; this turns out to be a fish balloon with which a young child is playing. Humphrey pops the balloon, and both the boy and Woodlore kick the bear in the knee. Humphrey thinks of some other way to foil the anglers, discovers the same boy from before walking on the shore of the lake with a toy boat, removes the bottom from the boat, ties it onto his head like a hat, and then submerges himself into the lake so that only the top of his hat shows, tricking the anglers into thinking that there is a shark in the water and causing them to flee in terror. He then steals all of the anglers\' bags of fish, but then he loads the fish in these bags into Humphrey\'s airplane, giving him more of a full load than he was expecting.

So is Babba, an old Urdu poet who is dying an unknown death. Having shut his eyes to the callous world that weighs art with money, he has woven a charming little world of his own. Babba's state of nonchalant bliss inadvertently drives his daughter Minni into a world of bitter silences. And, across the road lives Pappan, a small-time debt-ridden publisher who is eyeing Babba's treasured verses and his beautiful daughter.

Coyote, standing on the road, pulls out an arrow-shaped sign saying "Coyote" and another saying "Apetitius Giganticus". The Road Runner speeds by with a Beep-beep and ruffles the coyote\'s fur. Wile flips the signs to read "Road-Runner" and "Fastius Tasty-us", and winds up his legs, followed by his body, and chases the Road Runner. When the Road Runner sees the Coyote chasing him, he taunts him and gears into superspeed. This causes the road to roll up, a tunnel to turn inside-out, and a bridge to be destroyed as he puts his would-be predator far behind. Wile E. stops short of the chasm, panting, and two light bulbs signal his new-found idea. 1. Wile E. prepares himself to chase the Road Runner with his new roller skis, and skis off the plateau down the mountain and onto the road that the Road Runner is dashing over. As the camera cuts separately to Wile and the Road Runner, the bird turns across a U-turn at the end of a cliff, while Wile speeds off. When Wile E. realizes his mistake, he drops the ski poles, and soon slams into the side of another cliff. The Coyote looks up and down, trying to figure out how to escape, until he hears and sees the Road Runner at the top of the cliff. The skis provide a rather convenient "spring" for Wile E., who uses them to get closer and closer to grabbing the Road Runner. Eventually, he grabs within millimeters of his opponent, but unfortunately, the downward force and Wile\'s weight is too much for the skis to handle this time, and the Coyote suffers gravity. 2. The Road Runner beeps at Wile E. from across the canyon, and the camera pans to the Coyote attempting to shoot himself over the canyon with a bow. Before he can fire himself, the very end of the cliff crumbles and the bow tips over the side. Wile E. flips himself over in the air, but this causes him to bounce up and get his head stuck inside the edge of the cliff. The Coyote initiates a new plan. 3. Wile E. lights a needle-nosed dart bomb and throws it at a target attached to a cactus, exploding all three items. He then gets in a hot air balloon with an artillery of dart bombs. He sees the Road Runner zipping over the road and lights the bombs. Upon lighting, the bombs circle in the air but the last one lands in the Coyote\'s balloon, blowing it up. He waves at the camera and falls toward the ground, but stops himself by releasing a parachute. Unfortunately, dart #2 blows this up, and Wile E. is left to wave at the camera with an AGAIN sign before he plummets again. A third dart follows him to the ground and explodes. 4. Wile E. gives the Road Runner a snack while he awaits with a hammer behind a turn. The Road Runner is heard approaching, but the camera immediately cuts to a fourth dart blowing up the hammer handle and the hammerhead landing on the Coyote\'s head. The blow causes Wile E.\'s eyes to register "TILT!" in the manner of a pinball machine. 4. The Coyote hurls a newly acquired boomerang at the passing Road Runner, but it disappears behind a rock and comes back around with dart #5 attached and approaches him. The boomerang passes the fleeing Coyote and hovers over one spot. Wile stops moving, thinking he has outrun the bomb, but in reality it is right next to him and blows up before he can run away. 5. Wile now attempts a simple gun-in-the-woods trap, but a sixth bomb plugs the barrel and explodes. The camera cuts to a seventh bomb, which blows up under a huge boulder and sends it into the air, adding insult to injury to the Coyote when it flattens him. 6. As the Road Runner traverses another road, the Coyote is shown at the end of a cliff 900 feet in the air, holding an anvil ready to drop. An eighth bomb takes out a third of the cliff\'s edge, and two more darts pepper the floating end. Wile E. jumps onto the "secure" main cliff, but the entire cliff falls down. The Coyote pulls himself on top of the anvil to avoid getting bonked on the head with it. The anvil smashes through the ground, followed by Wile E. and the floating end of the cliff with the two darts. The Coyote covers his face with his ears to prepare for the worst, but instead of exploding the two darts unfurl into "THE" and "END". Wile E. pokes one eye out at both of them and laughs deeply.'] ['Mrs Hardy is annoyed that her husband Oliver seems to spend more time with his friend Stanley than with her.

Betty works as a lion tamer and a tightrope walker. Another of the other circus attractions is Koko the Clown. While performing on the highwire the villainous ringmaster lusts for Betty as he watches her from below, singing "Do Something," a song previously performed by Helen Kane. As Betty returns to her tent, the ringmaster follows her inside and sensually massages her legs, surrounds her and threatens her job if she does not submit. Betty begs the ringmaster to cease his advances, as she sings "Don\'t Take My Boop-Oop-A-Doop Away". Koko the Clown is outside, practicing his juggling, and hears the struggle. He leaps in to save Betty\'s virtue, struggling with the ringmaster who loads him into a cannon, firing it, thinking that he has sent the hero away, laughing with self-satisfaction. But Koko is hiding inside the cannon, and strikes the ringmaster out cold with a mallet, returning with "the last laugh". When Koko expresses concern about Betty\'s welfare, she answers in song, "No, he couldn\'t take my boop-oop-a-doop away!" The film ends with Koko sweetly kissing Betty on the cheek.'] ["Konrad, a poor miller's son, wants to marry Marie, a rich miller's daughter, but her widowed father is malicious and avaricious, and tricks the lovers in a despicable way.

He tries to first steal a bottle of milk, then a whole ham from Tom and Jerry's house, but is unwittingly thwarted both times by Tom, who is oblivious to Butch's efforts. Undaunted, Butch decides to disguise himself as an abandoned baby on the doorstep in order to infiltrate the house and gain access to the well-stocked refrigerator in the kitchen.  The ruse works, and Tom brings Butch into the house. Butch finds that, between having to outwit and outmaneuver both Tom and Jerry, getting his paws on the ham proves difficult. Tom gives him milk, and dumps him into a bassinet holding a steaming disinfectant boiling water bath. He screams and lands in the soapy water, cleaning himself and Tom at the same time, as he dumps his host in the bath as well. He gains sympathy from Tom against Jerry by pointing after the mouse and crying like a baby, but Jerry eventually turns the tables when he alerts Tom to Butch emptying contents of the refrigerator into his bassinet.

Butch, still in his baby disguise, suddenly appears at the window, asking for some ham in baby talk. Grudgingly amused by Butch's sheer nerve, Tom passes the ham to him; at first, he cuts off only a tiny sliver. But Butch then grabs the entire ham and begins gobbling it down greedily as he fights off Tom and Jerry."] [" A puppy, who is strangely born with a coat that is a shade of light blue, is rejected by all.

After trying to get them, only to see the gophers dive into their hole and then overrun the hole and off a cliff, the dog  discovers four ways to get a gopher: * No. 1: The canny hunter will remember that gophers possess an enormous curiosity concerning strange or unfamiliar objects: To this end, the dog places a spring with a punching glove attached to it in a chest. When the Gophers, after deciding to ignore the "Do Not Open until Xmas" sticker, open it, they "see" jewelry in it and take the chest with them. The dog takes the chest away from the Gophers and opens it, only to be punched below his chin, as he bounces like a pogo stick. * No. 2: Gophers are quite fond of fresh vegetables which can therefore be used as bait that would attract them: The dog, knowing that the gophers are vegetarians, plants a row of radishes in the ground along with a turnip at the end of the row that is booby-trapped to an overhanging rock tied around a nearby tree, which the dog tests with a ball, triggering the trap successfully. Naturally, the Gophers pick up all of the radishes, and after initial trouble, take the turnip—but the trap is not triggered this time. The dog then holds the string, but triggers the trap and says to himself "Oh,No." before he is crushed. * No. 3: The gopher is a sentimental little creature whose feelings may be played upon to your advantage: The dog, calling himself Snookie, places himself in a booby-trapped carriage, with his cries quickly noticed by the Gophers. After discovering the booby trap under the dog , the Gophers push the carriage up a hill, and then release the carriage with the dog in it down the cliff on the other side, leaving the dog howling as he goes over several hills  and vertically down a second cliff, where he crashes. As the dog claims that the Gophers missed his inner strength, the dog then falls down, stiff as a board. * No. 4: If all else fails,  you must utilize the gophers\' love of music: The dog begins playing what amounts to a one-man band of music, drawing the Gophers\' attention as they start dancing to the music. The dog unsuccessfully tries to crush them with cymbals and a banjo that also doubles as a gun, but does drag them to the drums using a trumpet. As the dog tries to crush the gophers on the drums, they evade him and the dog and Gophers end up in the piano, where the Gophers have the dog "trapped like a rat in a trap", as the Gophers then hop all over the piano keys. Hammers attached to various keys hit the dog in his rear end as the cartoon concludes with the dog regretting having ever read the book.'] ['This is another morality lesson in a long string of such films.

When the real Bob and Larry arrive, Jimmy and Jerry explain that they figured that they\'ve been wanting to host since Dave and the Giant Pickle, and that Bob and Larry could use a break. Bob argues that he just had a break , but humors the gourds and lets them tell a short story they wrote called "The Englishman Who Went Up A Hill ". In this "story", an Englishman  goes up a hill and steals all the bananas which he doesn\'t eat or share. Then a Swede  goes up another hill and steals all the strawberries. As both men refuse to eat their own fruit without some of the other to go with it, but are too selfish to lend some to each other, they are stuck hoarding their respective piles from one another indefinitely, and the story ends with Jean Claude , who has been interjecting the story from offscreen with cries of "you\'re so selfish!", pointing out that they are "not very bright".

In this story, King George  only cares about rubber ducks. His servant Louis  tries to tell him the kingdom is in the middle of the Great Pie War though George doesn\'t care. To him, the most important person in the world is himself. As George proclaims his love for himself and his rubber duck, he notices a rubber duck which belongs to a poor boy named Thomas . Jealous, King George tells Louis to get him the duck, but Louis refuses. At this point, Cedric the General  says that they need more men on the battlefield. Seeing his opportunity, George announces that Thomas wants to help and tells Cedric to put Thomas on the front line of the battle alone. With Thomas out of the way, George tells Louis to meet him at Thomas\'s house so they can take the duck. At this point, it\'s time for Silly Songs with Larry. Today\'s song is "Endangered Love", in which Larry follows the tragic saga of his favorite daytime soap-opera character, Barbara Manatee. As he watches Barbara and her boyfriend Bill overcome life\'s obstacles, Larry sings of his own affections for Barbara. Back in the story, King George and Louis manage to steal the duck and the King is happy. Before George can take a bath with his new duck, Cedric and Thomas come. According to Cedric, Thomas ended the war all on his own, but has suffered "the trauma of war" in the process. George quickly shooes them away and again tries to get in the bath, but is interrupted by Melvin , a "slightly odd wiseman who shows up every so often" to tell a story using amazing audiovisual technology... a flannelgraph. Melvin tells a story of two men, one who had many sheep and one who had only a single sheep. Visited by a guest, the rich man steals the sheep from the poor man to serve for dinner. Furious, George asks who this rich man is, and Melvin points out that it\'s George himself. His actions in stealing Thomas\'s duck have done nothing but prove the King\'s selfishness, and Melvin tells George that "Whether we are a king or just a kid, God wants us all to put others first." Looking to make up for his sins, George lets Thomas take a bath in his tub, which cures his war trauma, and then returns his duck. George then apologizes to God, Thomas, and Louis for his selfishness and is forgiven, thus ending the story. Back on the countertop, Bob finishes up the story by adding that the next day, King George shared all his ducks with his people.

Mammy calls Tom into the living room, but as the maid turns her back, the trio reveal their true colors and prepare to attack her using a lit match placed in her slipper, a firework placed in the bow of her apron and a slingshot aimed directly at her ample backside. Before they can pull it off, they hide the paraphernalia because Mammy turns around and Tom is in the living room. Mammy tells Tom that he is to take care of them while she runs an errand, but when Tom turns his back, the kittens take the slingshot, match and firework, attack Tom, and make it look like they were the ones attacked by planting a knife on Tom and appearing knocked out.

Coyote on a rocket, and the rocket\'s exhaust repeatedly runs into the camera during the chase, allowing the title cards to be shown. The chase begins in full force, and the Coyote gains on the Road Runner, leans off the rocket slightly, and prepares to sink his utensils into the Road Runner. Then the cartoon pauses for Wile E.\'s Latin name , and then for the Road Runner\'s . The chase continues down the road as Wile E. prepares to make his move, but before he can deliver the final blow, he hits his head on a tunnel arch as the Road Runner goes through it. The Road Runner and the rocket come out the other end; the bird escapes and the rocket  returns toward its owner. Wile E. recovers from the jar and climbs down, but soon returns upwards when he sees the rocket coming at him. He sighs with relief and dismounts the arch, but, ironically, is hit by an ACME truck. Wile E. is pacing around a mountaintop when he runs directly into the Road Runner, who beeps and causes Wile E.\'s head to retract after being scared into a rock ceiling. The Coyote chases after the bird through a cloud of dust, but only manages to throw himself into thin air. The Road Runner alerts the Coyote, who promptly suffers gravity to his annoyance. He manages to climb back up the mountain again, but no sooner does he do so than the Road Runner, on another plateau, beeps again. 1. The Coyote uses a see-saw and rock to attempt to launch himself towards the Road Runner, but the rock breaks through the cliff\'s edge, and the Coyote slides from the top of the board down and through the hole. He falls into almost the same spot as the first time, creating a cross of coyote imprints in the ground. 2. The Coyote patches up a trampoline on the desert ground and then proceeds to man a sniper rifle. He hears the Road Runner\'s beep, but doesn\'t see him approaching. He turns around to find the bird is actually perched 20 feet behind him. So he turns the rifle around, but there\'s no space on the other side. Wile E. falls off the cliff again, and then directly busts through his trampoline. 3. The Coyote has now ordered a giant rubber band and ties it around two rocks, hoping to trap the Road Runner. However, it is so elastic that it pulls the two rocks together while Wile E. is still in between them. 4. Now, Wile E. lights a bunch of fireworks inside a barrel and bungee-swings the barrel out into open space above the road which the Road Runner is about to pass. But the very edge of the rock that Wile E. is standing on breaks off, causing the Coyote to swing directly below the barrel. As the rope begins to snap, Wile E. climbs up to escape the calamity, but fails to make it off in time. He falls to the ground and is smashed by the barrel. Now, the Coyote has to escape his own security measure - a nailed-shut lid. Wile E. manages to hammer off all the nails and climb out of the barrel, then hide and wait for the explosion. However, he forgot to check the lid - the fireworks are on the lid, which Wile E. is still wearing! 5. Next, Wile E. builds a high wire structure and dons a wheel-head. He struggles to get himself balanced upside-down on top of the wire , and when he finally is able to let go of the rock, the wire snaps, sending Wile E. crashing headfirst into the ground. Then, the wire drapes over a power line while one end falls into the Coyote\'s hole, resulting in the Coyote incurring a violent electrical shock. 6. The Coyote now attaches TNT to the bottom of a high bridge as he waits on the ground with the controller. The Road Runner moves towards the intended target, but stops short of the bridge. The bridge detonates and the concrete falls directly upon the poor Coyote. 7. Wile E.\'s last plan is to use ACME Tornado Seeds to trap the Road Runner. Wile E. tests them by placing one next to a small cactus and shooting the requisite blast of water at it. The seed morphs into a tornado and sucks up the cacti as planned. Therefore, Wile E. drops a handful of seeds into the road just before the Road Runner turns up. Wile E. fires his pistol, but instead of firing the seeds on the road to suck up the Road Runner, it malfunctions and all the water comes out the bottom and when it lands on the jar of tornado seeds, it grows big and it makes the jar cold. The jar spin and all the words are gone and all the remaining seeds form a huge tornado that sucks up the Coyote and brake the jar and takes him on the spin of his life, culminating in a journey into an army mine field. Wile E. suffers explosion after explosion as the Road Runner pulls down the "That\'s All Folks!" end-title card  like a curtain. The End.'] ['The film starts with a man  reading the novel Dracula .

The film was shot during the Junior Vanderbilt CupKids Auto Races at Venice, Cal. at The Charlie Chaplin Encyclopedia, an actual race with Chaplin and his co-stars improvising gags in front of real-life spectators. Unusually the camera "comes out of shot" to show a second camera filming , to better explain the joke. At this stage Chaplin only gets in the way of the visible camera on screen, not the actual filming camera.

The master\'s actions and behavior are very mysterious and secretive, which causes his manservant to be suspicious of his whereabouts. The Master is seen doing such things as writing a letter in the secrecy of his study room, gathering eggs from the side of a cliff, and it is even implied he had an affair with the female servant. One day, the shocked manservant discovers the Master in a barn feeding the eggs he gathered to a huge boar, much to the Master\'s shame.

Super-Rabbit is described as "Faster than a speeding bullet" , "More powerful than a locomotive" , "able to leap tall buildings in a single bound" . The story begins in the lab of scientist Professor Cannafraz, whose voice seems patterned after Richard Haydn\'s character Edwin Carp. The professor has just created a "super carrot." His test subject, Bugs  --, who variously addresses Cannafraz as "Boibank," "Edison," and "Pasture" -- immediately wolfs down the proffered carrot. Now he has all of Superman\'s super-abilities, but only temporarily; he must periodically eat another carrot to replenish his powers. Bugs declares this a "cozy" deal, then remembers a newspaper article about "Cottontail Smith", a hunter in Texas who wants to hunt down all rabbits. After declaring "This looks like a job for Super-Rabbit!", Bugs dons his costume, gathers up the super carrots, gives the professor a kiss, and departs. He flies past a horse who happens to be sauntering in the middle of the air, who then turns to the camera and shouts, "A rabbit? Up HERE!?" Bugs flies to Deepinaharta, Texas , and assumes the \'disguise\' of a "mild-mannered forest creature," complete with oversized glasses and hat. He soon encounters Smith, who bears a striking resemblance to fellow Texan Lyndon Baines Johnson. Smith tries to shoot Bugs, but none of the bullets penetrate. Bugs hands him a cannon, eats another carrot , then, upon being struck by the cannonball, plays basketball with it, quickly shoving Smith and his horse onto bleachers while he acts as his own cheerleader. After Bugs returns to the air to "think up some more deviltry," the bemused Smith and his horse fly into the sky with their own airplane. Bugs then snatches the shell of the plane away from them, causing them to fall to Earth. Bugs runs out of power, but when he tries to "recharge" again his carrots fall to the ground. When Bugs lands, he opens his eyes to see a line of eaten carrots. Smith and his horse are now both superheroes. Bugs turns to the camera and says "This looks like a job for a REAL Superman!" He ducks into a phone booth, and both Smith and the horse are ready to attack - until the booth opens and they both snap to attention and salute. Bugs marches out in a Marine uniform, singing The Marines Hymn. He dismisses the two, claiming he has "important woik to do!" Still singing, he marches off past a sign pointing to \'Berlin, Tokyo and points East.\' Note: Throughout the cartoon, Bugs uses conveniently-placed phone booths to don new disguises. This is most likely a parody of Superman\'s consistent use of phone booths to change identity.'] ["The film stars British actor Dan Richardson as Stewart Hanson, an attorney annoyed by the presence of his wife's grandmother, Crystal Colburn, who has moved in—and seems determined to deliberately disrupt his life and marriage.

The pursuit quickly veers out of control, as innocent bystanders are imperiled. The kids at the zoo have finished their visit and are back on the school bus. Their bus gets caught up in the chase when Ronald McDonald\'s truck tips over right in front of the Pizza Hut where Esso Girl is waiting on the Original Pringles mascot and the Pringles Hot & Spicy mascot as they have lunch together. Several guns and biological weapons spill out of the back of Ronald McDonald\'s truck, tempting Big Boy and Haribo to steal them for sale on the black market. Ronald McDonald takes Big Boy hostage and runs inside the Pizza Hut. Once inside, Big Boy bites Ronald McDonald and runs for cover behind the counter with Esso Girl. Enraged, Ronald McDonald opens fire, giving the police the excuse to start firing on him, and he kills one of the police officers. As the gun battle explodes in to the streets, a low rumbling can be heard across the entire city. A giant earthquake splits the streets of the city open, meanwhile Big Boy and Esso Girl escape out the back and steal a cop car. While running from the police on a stolen motorcycle, Ronald McDonald falls into one of the crevasses . As he tries to pull himself out, he is run over by Esso Girl & Big Boy\'s car. The duo barely escape the city. As they near the Hollywood sign, it falls apart, sending the giant letters crashing on to the highway in front of them. While evading one of them, they veer off the highway  and down a hill. Their car crashes into a tree American Century Investments, and oil erupts in the rifts around town, flooding Los Angeles with crude oil. The hill Esso Girl and Big Boy are on, splits in two, revealing a giant North Face logo. Eventually, the land crumbles around them, swallowed by the sea, leaving them on a tiny island together  as the film closes by zooming out to reveal that the entire Universe is made up of even more logos. After the credits, a bald, toothless Ronald McDonald, menacingly laughs and says "I\'m lovin\' it".'] ['The beginning of the film starts with DeLeo, Bisson and Surkov driving through Kiev. This is introduced as the beginning of their journey to Pripyat, near the ground zero of Chernobyl. Once they reach the outpost outside the exclusion zone, we see that the area surrounding Pripyat is very deserted and dark. Once in the city, we see Surkov\'s old home, which he explains has been robbed of almost all its belongings due to looters. Yet there are still some mementos in the old apartment, including the wallpaper he and his mother put up, the training bars his father bought for him, an old rubber ball he claims was his favorite and a white horse poster plastered on the wall of his old bedroom. The pain he feels is evident. When he sees an old calendar on a door, he rips a large portion off, claiming "the year ended on April 26th". Outside the door of the apartment, he remarks how he wishes he could stay forever. He throws his old ball through the door and walks out of the apartment complex. The film ends with Surkov snapping some twigs in an old courtyard and then an image of the car they traveled in leaving the exclusion zone.HBO: White Horse - Synopsis | HBO Film-makers attempted to contact Maxym Surkov, the featured interviewee, when the film debuted. They were informed that he had died from a heart attack in February 2008, shortly after the completion of the film. He is survived by his wife and one daughter.Christophe Bisson personal correspondence.'] ['Bugs wakes up after a long night to find that a burly construction worker  has just shoveled up his rabbit hole near a highrise building being built. Bugs kindly asks the construction worker to put his hole back, but the worker simply dumps Bugs and the dirt into a dump truck. Bugs angrily shouts "Hey, you big gorilla! Haven\'t you ever heard of the sanctity of the American home?" before another mound of earth falls on him and the truck hauls him away. But a when the worker exits the crane, Bugs calls him from the building under construction  dropping a brick on him , then a steel girder, and then plays with the elevator controls while the worker is inside the elevator. Bugs then impersonates the project engineer and orders the worker to make a high brick wall. Next, Bugs traps the worker on a teeterboard, removing bricks one by one, causing it to tip forward. The worker, desperate not to fall, strips down to his underwear. Ultimately, the worker falls in the end. However, the worker manages to get the better of Bugs, knocking him out temporarily with a steel girder and causing Bugs to dumbly "sleepwalk" through a harrowing series of moving girders and other objects, finally regaining his senses when he falls into a barrel full of water. When Bugs recovers and sees the worker taking the lunch of a shy worker for himself and sending the hapless man back to work, this infuriates Bugs. Bugs takes a look at the floor plans for the building, then drops a single red-hot rivet down a hole, which bounces around through an elaborate maze of objects, until it burns through a rope holding up a giant steel pipe. The pipe then falls on top of the worker . The worker finally waves the white flag in defeat. The next shot is of the finished skyscraper, with a slight indentation in the middle. At the bottom, Bugs sits in his hole - the building has been built around it - and declares: "After all, a man\'s home is his castle."'] ['After opening credits underscored by the William Tell Overture , the music segués into a lively instrumental of Cheyenne as the action begins. The opening scene features a typical Old West frontier town with the self-contradictory name of Rising Gorge. Bullets are firing from every window across the street into every other window across the street. A hail of bullets flies down one street until a traffic light turns red and the bullets hover in mid-air while a second hail of bullets shoot by on the perpendicular street. The light changes back and just as the first hail of bullets is about to start, a lone bullet "runs the red light" at even higher speed, holding up the first stream. After it passes, the first hail continues. The scene then cuts to the Gunshot Saloon with the slogan of \'Come in a get a slug\', and Western saloon-type piano music plays Cheyenne in the background. Inside, two men are standing at a bar. One man is about to drink a shot of whiskey; the second man takes out his gun and shoots the first man. The first man throws his glass into the air and the second man catches it. A scream is heard and Yosemite Sam enters the bar. All of the patrons are afraid of Sam, yelling his name in terror while the underscore plays Der Erlkönig . Sam says, "Yeah, Yosemite Sam. The roughest, toughest, he-man stuffest hombre whose ever crossed the Rio Grande... And I don\'t mean Mahatma Gandhi! (Certain versions of the cartoon censor the line.<ref nameWells|firstAnimation: genre and authorship|yearWallflower Press|isbn46|quote=I don\'t mean Mahatma Gandhi  Now all of you skunks clear out of here!" After firing his guns, all the patrons run out, followed by a real skunk which looks similar to Pepe le Pew who retorts, "My, weren\'t there a lot of skunks in here?" Sam turns around to see a man trying to sneak out. Sam fires his guns at the man, who then turns into a firing range walking dummy, making a "ding" every time he is hit, with a score board above keeping tally. After that, Sam asks, "Now be there any livin\' varmint who aims to try to tame me?" Spying Bugs Bunny, he asks again, "Well, be there?" No one dares to challenge Yosemite Sam except Bugs, sporting a cowboy hat and rolling a cigarette. After a brief silence, Bugs replies ... "I aims ta ..." As they march toward each other, Bugs breaks the fourth wall and says to the audience, "Just like Gary Cooper, huh?", and then draws a carrot instead of a gun. Sam declares, "this town ain\'t big enough for the two of us!" Bugs tries to rectify that by running off-screen and, to sound effects of hammers and saws and music from the first movement of Beethoven\'s Sonata Pathétique, quickly constructs a background of modern skyscrapers in the town, but "it\'s still not big enough!" They then pull out guns, one each a shot larger than the other, until Sam pulls out a 10-shooter and Bugs responds with a pea shooter, which he uses. In the time-honored western cliché, Sam orders Bugs to "Dance!" while firing at his feet. Bugs grabs a cane and straw hat from off-screen, and goes into the same vaudeville soft shoe routine he first exhibited in Stage Door Cartoon , then says "Take it, Sam!" The diminutive villain, although startled initially, quickly breaks  into the same dance, and is tricked into dancing into an open mine shaft . This gag is featured in the 1991 cartoon Bunny. When Sam returns to the surface, Bugs dares him to cross a line drawn with his foot. "OK, I\'m a-steppin\'!" Bugs continues this schtick all the way out of town to the edge of a cliff, where the unobservant Sam steps over the line and plummets toward the ground far below.  Suddenly stricken with guilt, the speedy hare dashes down a roadway, beats Sam to the ground and lays down a mattress, telling the audience, "Ya know, sometimes me conscience kinda bodders me ... but not this time!" as he pulls away the mattress. Sam smashes into the ground  and the already pint-sized bandit has been vertically flattened to a hat with legs, but he still comes up firing. A horseback chase scene ensues, to the tune of the William Tell Overture, as the two ride on horses that are proportional to their own sizes . Bugs leads Sam into a tunnel, and again showing extraordinary construction talents, has time to don a painter\'s cap and build a brick wall at the other end, which Sam smacks into. After more chasing, Bugs stops the chase and points out that they are getting nowhere and are right back where they began , and Sam agrees. The two decide to settle their differences "like the Western pictures" by playing cards, with the loser being forced to leave town . Sam tells Bugs to "cut the cards", which he does using a meat cleaver, a joke previously seen in a Harpo Marx gag in the 1932 film Horse Feathers, a Curly Howard gag in 1936\'s Ants in the Pantry - and probably a lot older than that. With a new deck, Bugs tricks Sam into playing a card that gives Bugs the win {"GIN! You lose!!"}. Bugs tries to get Sam to take the train out of town to the tune of Cheyenne, but when the passenger car is revealed to be full of swimsuit-clad women headed on the Miami Special to the tune of Oh You Beautiful Doll, Bugs fights with Sam to board the train. Bugs prevails as usual. In the final shot, he leans out the train window, his face covered with lipstick from kisses, and hollers a line similar to one from Hare Trigger: "So long, Sammy, see ya in Miami!" The cartoon is ended by the strains of Aloha \'Oe.'] ['Instead of Elmer Fudd, Bugs is hunted by a dog named Willoughby, but the dog falls for every trap Bugs sets for him until they both fall off a cliff at the end .'] ['At the estate of King Herman the 6⅞ , the deposed king of Moronica, war profiteers Ixnay , Amscray  and Umpchay   have decided that they have had enough of Moe Hailstone, the fascist dictator they put in power, and want to help Herman retake the throne. To this end, he sends his daughter, the princess Gilda  to try and assassinate Hailstone using an explosive pool ball strategically positioned in Hailstone\'s billiard table. The fictitious country of Moronica  seems to be familiar with a pool game in which the 13 ball is placed at the head of the rack during set up. Dictator Moe Hailstone of Moronica enjoys a shave, and fights Field Marshal Herring  and Minister of Propaganda  for a turkey . The winner of that battle is a picture of Napoleon who grabs the bird from the bewildered Stooges. Gilda enters, and shows the Stooges a glimpse through a telescope of all three of them on a spit roasting in Hell and starts to place in Hailstone\'s mind the idea that his allies, the "Axel" partners, are plotting against him. After doing this she replaces the 13 ball on Hailstone\'s pool table with an exploding No. 13 ball and flees as Hailstone begins a pool game with his partners. Throughout the game, the cue ball inexplicably defies the laws of physics, avoiding the exploding ball by swerving around it and finally jumping over it, colliding with Herring\'s head. Later, the Axel partners arrive for a meeting. The partners consist of Chiselini , the Bey of Rum ; an unnamed Japanese delegate ; and an unnamed Russian delegate . As the meeting breaks into chaos following Hailstone\'s declaration that the world belongs to him, the Stooges go into action on the other delegates and each other. Finally, with all the other Axels delegates defeated, Hailstone orders Herring to surrender the globe they had fought over. Herring refuses and smashes it over Hailstone\'s head, sending him into a tantrum. Herring, finally having enough of Hailstone\'s patronizing antics, yells at Hailstone as he grabs the exploding ball and throws it against the floor in frustration, blowing up the meeting room. Herman regains his throne and the trio\'s heads are shown mounted on a wall.'] ['Daffy is a guard at a scrap pile, encouraging Americans to "Get the tin out", "Get the iron out" and especially "Get the lead out". Singing We\'re in to Win, Daffy goes over the various things Americans can send to help with the war effort. However, this doesn\'t go down well with Adolf Hitler, who reads about Daffy\'s scrap pile helping to beat Benito Mussolini, and responds to this by giving his men the following order: "Destroy that scrap pile!" With the word out, a Nazi submarine sends a torpedo to the scrap pile — which has a billy goat inside, who immediately starts eating everything in sight. Daffy, hearing the noise, tries to find out what\'s making the noise. After temporarily pointing a rifle at a reflection of himself , Daffy finds the goat hiccuping with the garbage inside him and amiably offers him a bicarbonate. However, when Daffy sees the swastika that the goat  is wearing, he starts messing with the goat. Temporarily getting the better of the goat, Daffy is almost undone when he tries to whack the goat with a mallet - but the mallet gets stuck in the goat\'s horns and the goat knocks Daffy around. Daffy is ready to call it quits , but is encouraged by the ghosts of his \'ancestors\' — ducks who landed on Plymouth Rock, who encamped at Valley Forge with George Washington, who explored with Daniel Boone, who sailed with John Paul Jones, and who stood in for Abraham Lincoln. Daffy\'s spirits back up when he realizes, "Americans don\'t give up, and I\'m an American... duck!", and then he turns into "Super American" in a reference to Superman . Daffy flies after the goat, knocking him around. The goat makes a run for the submarine, but Daffy repels all bullets shot at him and starts yanking on the periscope. Just then, the scene changes to Daffy yanking on a fire hose and getting hosed down. Daffy wakes up, thinking it was all just a dream — until he looks up at the Nazi submarine sitting on top of the scrap pile, where the Nazis tell Daffy, "Next time you dream, include us out!"'] ['The Stooges are detectives who have nearly mastered the game of Gin Rummy.

The next man they bring up is a witness, an organ grinder with a monkey named Antonio Zucchini Salami Gorgonzola dePizza . The witness begins to download his information to the Stooges, but his Italian looks do not match the English cockney accent that comes out of his mouth.

Just when all seems lost Larry returns with Chopper who says he wants to confess to the murder. However, while taking down his confession, the real killer finally shows up .

Colin Cunningham describes the movie as follows: "Centigrade, in a nutshell, is about a guy who lives in an old dilapidated, busted-up trailer. There\'s no wheels on it. It\'s just laying dead in the weeds. [The owner] does a bad thing, and he wakes up in the morning and [the trailer is] rolling down the highway. It\'s being towed by a big, black pickup truck.

The town\'s population seems to be shrinking, as evidenced by the sound of gunfire and dwindling numbers on the population sign.

Meanwhile, Tom is listening to a French cookery show, which is explaining a fish soup recipe ; the chef is voiced by Daws Butler. The most important thing, as described by Chef Françoise, is "one, small, fresh, FISH." Tom\'s mouth waters, and then he remembers where he can get one small fresh fish: the fishbowl. Tom slithers like a snake towards the fishbowl, takes the table with him and dumps the goldfish bowl onto the stove. He turns it on and chops up some of the directed vegetables: carrots and scallions. He tastes the water, then salts the fish and puts it back in the bowl. Jerry is strolling into the kitchen and is aghast when he sees Tom trying to cook his friend. Jerry opens the oven door and Tom falls into the oven. Jerry swipes the goldfish bowl and scrams. Tom hangs back and takes it off Jerry\'s hands as he runs past. Jerry sees he no longer has the bowl and trips up Tom with a baseball bat, then catches the goldfish and some water in a water glass. Jerry runs to his hole and stands aside as Tom slams into the wall, then skips through Tom\'s ears into the hole, safe. Tom won\'t give up and prepares a trap for the fish. Jerry spots a full fishbowl on the table and moves the fish to within jumping range. He jumps for his bowl, but Tom is behind the curtain and catches the goldfish in a frying pan, the cat having abandoned the fish soup idea. Tom breads the fish in flour and tosses it into his mouth after a brief sizzle. Jerry hits Tom in the face with the pan and pulls one of Tom\'s whiskers to open his mouth, allowing the goldfish to escape. He jumps into a cup of water with Jerry and Jerry runs from Tom, who runs through a wardrobe and squeezes through Jerry\'s mousehole in order to reach the fish. Jerry stops and holds out an iron, which stops Tom\'s charge. Tom seizes a pistol, shoots the cup and steals the fish. Jerry doesn\'t notice until safe in his mousehole. Tom is now trying to roast the fish alive over a fire. Jerry upends a clay bucket onto Tom\'s head and whacks it with a fireplace tool, causing the bucket to vibrate. Jerry steals the fish back, but Tom snaps the carpet and sends the fish careening into the toaster. Tom prepares a fish sandwich, but Jerry sticks his tail in the clothes roller. Tom screams in pain, but grabbing onto the toaster doesn\'t keep him from being flattened. Tom then holds a saucepan just above Jerry\'s hole, such that when Jerry runs into the hole, the fish is captured. Tom moves a cabinet in front of the hole  and goes off to steam the fish. Jerry takes an alternative route that happens to lead to where Tom is attempting to cook the fish. Tom puts the fish underneath his foot and chops up a potato while Jerry substitutes dynamite for a carrot and Tom\'s tail for the fish. Tom suspects nothing until his tail starts turning red and the covered saucepan starts steaming and shaking. Tom screams, run outside, slams the door on his tail and braces for the explosion. When it has passed, Tom pulls on his tail and sees the best he could hope for: Only part of his tail is gone. That is, until he opens the door and sees himself speeding away from Earth and the solar system. Jerry puts on a diving suit and joins the fish in the fishbowl as they watch Tom blown into the vacuum of space. The two shake hands happily.'] ["The film's lead character George Weygate , a kind family man, meets a young woman while driving home from work, the girl  suggests she is suffering from a diabetic seizure and demands him to take her to a block of flats as soon as possible to fictional Walker Street, in Sydney's Darlinghurst.

As The Sheriff is building his house, he realizes that he\'s been tricked, and he is now infuriated about building a house in the Garden and declares revenge, all the while hitting himself on the head with the hammer:"OOOH!

Confused as to why he is there, and noticing numerous differences in his town from how he last remembers it, he attempts to return to something familiar. The court house where he worked has been abandoned, and when Ogden arrives at it he breaks into despair. This leads him to return to a childhood pier and ponder what has happened and where he is going.  The synopsis from the Royal Flush Film Festival states "...[Ogden] falls deeper and deeper into confusion." This can reference the idea that Ogden appears to either be a displaced time traveler with amnesia or a man who has simply lost his mind or both.'] ["The Pink Panther, desperate for sleep, stumbles into a local hotel.

Using a pull back shot, the camera then shows the viewer that the words are part of a sign that reads: <div align"wikitable" border"text-align:center" | Aug 15–Oct 3- One Woman Show -Celia CrazelsnukOct 3–March 19- Usual Crap -Closed Mondays |}  It is night. A small art gallery stands with its door slightly ajar and the lights on. A bulbous-nosed man with thinning grey hair, holding a brown bottle and apparently drunk, wanders in. As he shuffles through the gallery, a small abstract sculpture is transformed, imitating the man behind his back before returning to its original shape without his noticing. The drunk male sees a picture of colorful musical notes that form a circle around a jagged shape resembling a red staircase. The picture moves to upbeat music for a moment and then returns to normal. Doubting his own eyes, the man looks again. The music begins to play, and a miniature man resembling the drunk skips down the stairs, stands on one of the circling musical notes, rides it for a while, then continues down the stairs to the bottom. The entire picture then becomes two abstract colored clay blobs that pulsate to the music. Suddenly the music stops and the drunk male is back in the gallery, where he makes a critical comment  and staggers away. The man sees a sculpture of a computer-like device with large lips and gauges for eyes. He laughs at the sculpture and flips a lever that starts it. The sculpture begins speaking rapidly and says it is a &#34;replica of the model 505 type P electro brain,&#34; claims to be far superior to its creators, and carries out its &#34;infinite mutation&#34; program. The computer begins to stutter as it tries to say it has a short circuit and an error before changing into a talking globe, a talking apple, a colorful bust of Albert Einstein, a television, and finally a hand with smaller hands at the end of each of the fingers before entirely melting down into a shapeless mass of clay. The drunk male walks away after making another comment , and is then frightened by some jungle animals reaching through a glassless window pane that turns out to be a harmless painting. Distressed, the drunk male walks on, where he sees a painting of a medieval woman kneeling on a castle floor. She holds a brush in her hand and a bucket is beside her. The drunk male asks her, &#34;Hey… wassa matter?&#34; She weeps and tells him, &#34;Oh, if my master could have seen more of the beauty in life… Here I am on my knees, doomed to wear this sorrowful face, scrubbing this cold stone floor forever and forever and forever…&#34; Then the painting returns to normal. The drunk male sees the still-open door and runs to get out of the gallery, but is stopped just before he gets there. He is a piece of statuary, and returns to his inanimate state before reaching the door.'] ['Jimmy has been after Sam for some time now. But what is he after? What does he want from him?

But Jerry emerges from his hole avoiding a Christmas-themed mousetrap placed by his hole. Jerry nears the Christmas presents, jumping merrily around the tree, licking candy canes and jumping onto a plush toy lion that squeaks. Jerry continues jumping on the soft toy, but bounces too hard and lands on Tom, who has woken up. Tom snarls and just before he can eat Jerry, the quick-thinking mouse grabs a nearby "Do Not Open \'Til Xmas" sticker and slaps it on Tom\'s mouth. Jerry hides among the myriad of toys  and hides inside a Christmas fairy light, causing him to glow. Not fooled, Tom grabs Jerry and is promptly electrocuted. Jerry hides among some toy soldiers, but Tom spots him and the mouse runs off, saluting the cat like a real soldier would. Tom chases Jerry, but is stopped by the barrier of a miniature level crossing. A toy train passes by, with many carriages. Jerry sits on top of the caboose, waving cheekily at Tom and pulling faces. As the train enters a model of a tunnel and Jerry hits his head, knocking him onto the track. He runs through the tunnel, pursued by Tom, who knocks the tunnel over. Jerry hides inside a boxing glove and boxes the puzzled cat in the face before running off behind the Christmas tree. Tom, now arming himself with a boxing glove of his own, follows him and spots him jumping into a jack-in-the-box. Opening up the box, Tom is punched by the boxing glove stuck on Jack\'s head and is knocked out. Jerry jumps out and holds it up in victory like a boxing referee. Tom chases Jerry once again, but Jerry holds out a piece of mistletoe in from of him and persuades an embarrassed Tom to kiss him. Tom blushes and while his back is turned, Jerry kicks him in the rear. The mouse darts through the letterbox slot into the outdoors. As Tom opens the lid of the letterbox to see where Jerry has gone, Jerry hurls a snowball at his face. Tom angrily barricades the slot so that Jerry cannot get back into the house.  While Jerry trudges up and down in the heavy snow in a vain attempt to warm himself, Tom fluffs up his cushion and prepares to sleep. He is unable to settle himself; heavenly choirs sing carols, pricking Tom\'s conscience with the message of Christmas peace and goodwill. He first props open the slot to allow Jerry back in and when the mouse does not reappear, ventures anxiously outside to find Jerry, frozen. Fearing for Jerry\'s life, he brings the frozen mouse indoors and warms him up by the fire. Slowly, Jerry regains consciousness, but is wary of the cat. Tom hands Jerry a candy cane, his Christmas present. A delighted Jerry licks his cane, but then quickly reacts to prevent Tom drinking from his bowl of milk. He dips his cane into the bowl and a loud snap is heard. Jerry uses the cane to fish a mousetrap that he had earlier planted in the bowl. Tom appreciates Jerry\'s warning and the mouse runs back to his hole. He uses his candy cane to hook the cheese off the mousetrap. Instead of snapping like a usual mousetrap does, the spring slowly comes down, ringing the tune of "Jingle Bells" as Jerry smiles in admiration to the "musical mousetrap."'] ['Made by combining footage from the original series with newly filmed material, it served as an "epilogue" to the original Ultraman television series, as Ultraman returns to Earth for one final battle. The plot of this episode picks up from Ultraman\'s defeat at the hands of Zetton. Zetton was destroyed by the Patrol and Ultraman is saved by Zoffy and has recombined with Hayata.

The movie opens with the scene of the black-garbed killer preparing to disembark from a small house. The individual places several items into a brief case, appearing among them a deck of cards, a notebook, and a copy of the children\'s novel Mr. Pig and Sonny Too — a real publication written in 1977 by the American author Lillian Hoban. The book\'s title has an obvious connection to the film\'s. The individual closes up his brief case, standing upright and turning to reveal on camera the bleeding, half-naked body of another man lying prostrate on the floor. The living man kicks aside the corpse of the dead one and continues downstairs, packing up his belongings into a black car and driving away along a deserted road. The suited driver continues through an outstretched desert with power lines lining the side of the dirt trail. His vehicle passes an outcrop of rocks with an inscription painted on its face. Although perhaps being unintelligible, it appears to read either as "ELLE" or "ELLIE". Another sign crops up immediately after, written in black, though is essentially unreadable. The film cuts to another individual, the unidentified man , masked in white bandages covering his head. He wanders through the desert until reaching a telephone poll and sitting down, cross-legged. The driver\'s car pulls up to the side of the road, and the masked figure enters on the passenger\'s side. The two drive down another path and stop at a small house. They exit the car, where it can be seen now that the driver is leading the masked figure by a rope which binds his wrists, all the while carrying his brief case. The dilapidated doorway to the house is shown to have the number "1334" laid out in small bones at the top, otherwise adorned with a dominoes, a crucifix, caution tape and various photographs of someone\'s arms being bound. As the camera zooms onto the door frame, scenes flash to the victimized masked man\'s arms being tied with gauze tape, and then finally at the bottom of the doorway a box of dominoes opens up to reveal a keyhole. Through the keyhole a pig mask can be seen sticking through a broken wall. The scene cuts again to a corridor in the house – the word "Look" is graffitied along the wall where the masked man is bound at the wrists to the ceiling. The camera spins around the room before showing the two men outside again, this time the masked victim being led by his rope to a cellar. There the victimizer empties his brief case, among his things his deck of cards, a large metal key, a wig and a book entitled Why God Permits Evil with a demonic face printed on the cover. The captor places his hand on the head of a once-more bound-to-the-ceiling victim and pulls part of the bandage-mask from his eye, exposing his darting sight and sense of fear. A collection of pliers, knives, scissors and other instruments can be seen below.'] ['This short documentary film on the life of Louise Dahl-Wolfe draws upon her art and her personality.

Their possessions, however, escaped unharmed but falls over Coyote, just as he was about to catch Road Runner, causing considerable pain to him . Coyote notices the ACME book of magic and becomes delightfully happy, as he now has a new weapon against the Road Runner. * 1: The first spell that Coyote tries is to turn the black cat into a feral beast. He succeeds, and the cat transforms into a black panther, but unfortunately, his beast proved to be too feral, and it quickly slices his belly into strips, fading Coyote like a balloon. * 2: Coyote buy an ACME flying broomstick and, after some trial and error, begins to chase the Road Runner through air. However when he enter in a gloomy tunnel, Coyote mistakes his beeps  with a horn of an approaching truck and suddenly changes his direction to the sky, only to be hit by two comets and get his broom "out of gas". After a long drop, Coyote manages to stop his broomstick in the middle of air and lands safely, only to the Road Runner scare him from his back with his beeps off a cliff and leaving the poor Coyote to suffer gravity. * 3: In his second spell, Coyote tries to turn himself in a giant, but much to his chagrin, the spell only affects his head, whose weight crushes his own body. * 4: Coyote uses invisible ink to make a bomb transparent and disguise it like a crystal ball in order lure a unsuspecting Road Runner to his death. However, the fake crystal ball actually works and the Road Runner sees Coyote\'s future where he\'s caught in middle of a huge explosion...a future that quickly turns into reality when the bomb rolls straight to him. * 5: In his third spell, Coyote learns levitation and uses his classical "seeds trap" to temporarily stop the Road Runner and smash him with a large rock. Unfortunately, the rock doesn\'t fall under his command, giving enough time for the Road Runner to finish his lunch and leave. After several unsuccessful attempts to makes the rock fall, Coyote leaves in disgust, only for the rock to follow and crush him. * 6: In his last spell, Coyote once again tries to shape shift the cat into another creature, and this time, into a pegasus to once again chase the Road Runner though air, but they inadvertently fly trough a load of poisonous snakes , and to make matters worse, the pegasus quickly turns into a flying carpet, and much to Coyote\'s anguish, they fly straight to a reserve of scorpions and to a field of cacti. The carpet is then turned into a monitor lizard , a lawnmower, and then into a white shark, and he and the Coyote land in a lake where the Coyote is viciously mauled by his familiar. It\'s turned out that the reason of the cat\'s uncontrollable transformations were Road Runner\'s fault, who found the book of magic and decided to test his powers. He then turns a mailbox into a gracious and beautiful female roadrunner and the two leave, walking and holding "hands", while the Coyote suffers being shark food. This Coyote and Roadrunner short is notable for being the only one so far to use the real taxonomic names Geococcyx californianus  and Canis latrans  instead of the usual pseudo-Latin names.'] ["Jaden Cole  relives an important day in his life over and over, each rewinded day sees new information.

His assistant, Ms. Jane Hogan finds his dead body in front of the sarcophagus of King Tush. She finds a syringe near the doctor\'s body. With no other evidence to go on, the police assume that Ms. Hogan is the killer, she admits her fingerprints are on the syringe, and she is convicted for the murder. A few days later, Clark Kent gets a call from a professor at the museum, asking him to come to the museum and listen to another theory on the death of Dr. Jordan. Clark sneaks out, claiming it is his Doctor, but out of curiosity, Lois follows. At the museum, the professor explains that Dr. Jordan was killed by a mummy\'s curse. He takes Clark through the Egypt exhibit at the museum and tells him the story of King Tush.  Lois follows them, making sure not to be seen. Before his death, the 12-year old Tush\'s father, the old pharaoh who ruled the North and warred against the South, commanded his giant, superhuman guards to swear an oath protect his son throughout eternity.

And no matter how much he eats, he never fills up.    When his mother leaves a pair of pies out to cool, Piggy swipes a pie from the windowsill and spins it around his finger as he eats it; he tries to eat a second pie in the same manner, but his mother catches him in time and he accidentally chomps on his bare fingers. That afternoon, his mother serves spaghetti for dinner. While the family says grace, he ties all of their spaghetti strands together, so that he can devour all the spaghetti  in a single slurp! His mother scolds him, but he clearly doesn\'t care. As the other pigs sleep, he is awake, in deep thought of food. The next morning, he finds himself invited into the home of a kindly, hiccuping old man . The old man asks Piggy if he is hungry and presents Piggy with a table laid out with a full-blown feast – complete with a roasted turkey. Overjoyed at the man\'s generosity, Piggy sits down, rubbing his belly in anticipation. At that moment the man shoves the table of food out of Piggy\'s reach as the cover of the chair is pulled out from under him. A leather belt across his arms and chest straps him in place as a robotic arm swings around to take hold of his nose. The man shows himself to be some sort of mad scientist declaring, "So, it\'s food you want!? Ha, ha!  We\'ll give you plenty of it!" The scene switches to the basement, revealing the Feed-A-Matic—a bizarre machine built for the sole purpose of force-feeding hungry little kids like Piggy . The scientist rushes down to activate the controls, yelling, "So, you love food,  eh?", and goes straight to his work. The chair Piggy is strapped into first carries him to a huge vat  filling with gallons of soup from cans; the mechanical arm then pulls on Piggy\'s nose forcing his mouth open to let in a torrent of soup through a feeder shaped like a Pelton wheel but with spoons as buckets. He is then fed bananas popped out of their skins down his throat like bullets. Next to follow are stops at a gumball machine that doles out olives and at a conveyor belt of ice cream cones dispensing ice cream via a bellows. Then comes the main course, a sandwich as big as a king-sized bed , followed by dessert dispensed from the "PIE-A-TROPE" -- pies spinning on the spindle of a converted jukebox. Laughing maniacally, the scientist—in various montages--incessantly continues forcing food into Piggy. After an entire day of the business, the pig is returned from the basement up to the mad scientist\'s living room, transformed into an extremely obese, food-packed ball. Bulging out of the restraints, Piggy is utterly happy. Smiling at the sight of Piggy’s extreme obesity, the scientist prods his fat twice and kindly asks "Have enough, my boy?" To which Piggy replies "Y-y-y-yes sir!" The doctor then unstraps him commenting, "Why, you\'re not half full!" With the sun setting, Piggy waddled his bloated way to the door, passing by the food the scientist had laid out on the kitchen table to bait him . Looking at the turkey he delights at the prospect of more food. He pulls off a drumstick, and after taking a bite, explodes. Or rather, he wakes up screaming in his own bed – it was just a dream. Then hearing the sound of his mother calling him to breakfast, he dashes downstairs and starts eating again with gusto.'] ["While working as a porter at Union Station in Los Angeles, the Pink Panther is forced at gunpoint by the Little White Man to assist him ina burglary at the Acme Manufacturing Company.

Suddenly, a group of animals  come running through the woods, scared for their lives . A crocodile  hands Bugs a booklet talking about the Tasmanian Devil and the many things it eats. Bugs reads: “Eats Aardvarks, Ants, Bears, Boars, Cats, Bats, Dogs, Hogs, Elephants, Antelopes, Pheasants, Ferrets, Giraffes, Gazelles &mdash; but there\'s no such animal.” While Bugs is going through the list from Stoats, Goats, Shoats, Ostriches, etc., the Tasmanian Devil comes roaring in and spots Bugs Bunny still reading the booklet as he completes the list from Octopuses, Penguins, People, Warthogs, Yaks, Newts, Walruses, Gnus, Wildebeests and then states "What?! No Rabbits?!" The Tasmanian Devil greedily says that it \'especially\' eats rabbits as it turns to the page that says it and eats the booklet. Bugs is able to temporarily fool Taz into thinking he\'s a monkey, which Tasmanian Devils don\'t eat . However, Taz soon starts chasing Bugs again.

Bugs ends up on a spit, trussed like a roast pig, as Taz puts salt and pepper on Bugs. Bugs is really nervous, because he is about to be eaten and has no escape plan, but luckily he sees Taz making a large salad to go with him.

The Vega Empire seized the opportunity to capture the Great Mazinger and forcing Duke and his Grendizer to do battle against the formidable Great Mazinger. Grendizer and Great Mazinger clash in battle until Grendizer manages to deactivate Great Mazinger using a special shot, suggested by Koji. Also starring in this movie are three exclusive saucer beasts named Jinjin, Gubigubi, and Koakoa that also battle Grendizer only to be easily defeated. The Movie is based on several ideas featured in UFO Robo Grendizer Manga by Go Nagai, Especially from Chapter 5. Captain Barandos made an appearance and stole Great Mazinger from it's hangar, and used it to fight Grendizer with the help of 3 other saucer beasts, similar to the movie. Also, in the Chapter 4 of the manga Mazinger Z and Great Mazinger have been stolen to fight Grendizer together, which Grendizer had tough time fighting both. {{Expand section}}"] ['The cartoon begins as a wolf howls from a mountain top, under a full moon. He takes a deep breath as his body inflates to accommodate extra air and releases another howl. Next, Bosko is seen riding a horse, playing a banjo and singing the cowboy song, "When the Bloom is on the Sage". His horse seems unable to go over a rock along their path and Bosko is forced to climb down and push him over it before they can continue on their way. The scene then shows the following words against a black background as the music switches to a piano rendition of "She\'ll be coming round the mountain".  Red Gulch ~ where men are men, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nine times out of ten ~  The view is next of a road outside a saloon and shadows in the window indicate that the patrons are having a good time. A small gun chase takes place and a passer-by is whacked on the head with what looks like a bottle of beer. Next, a really tall cowboy walks down the road but has the middle of his body shot out by the patrons. This results in him being reduced to the size of a midget. Bosko arrives and his horse collapses in a heap beside the pavement. Strolling toward the saloon on the opposite side of the road, Bosko throws open the doors and yells &#34;Howdy&#34; only to be greeted by a volley of gunshots. The patrons yell &#34;Hi Bosko&#34; in return as Bosko laughs uneasily. He then picks up his bullet ridden hat and walks inside where a three-piece band, comprising banjo, violin and piano, is playing &#34;She&#39;ll be coming round the mountain&#34;. Bosko starts to tap dance whilst some onlookers sway to the beat. The piano player thumps hard on the keys which makes a mug of beer fly through the air and empty the contents into his open mouth. He gulps it down and is suddenly consumed by flames that spread upwards from his feet. This results in his clothes being burnt off, exposing bloomers. He puckers a suddenly lipsticked mouth, crosses his knees in a shyly feminine fashion and walks away seductively. Bosko steps up to the piano and starts to play, rocking his stool in tune to the music. Next, four cards are seen held in someone&#39;s hand: a King, Jack, Queen and Joker. They sing a little ditty but the person holding the cards soon shoots the Joker putting an end to their performance. Bosko is shown still playing the piano whilst the other patrons gather in a circle and start dancing. The scene then cuts to show the following words The Deadwood stage &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Honey  is in a carriage that is hurtling down the highway with a big trunk on the roof. The ride is quite bumpy so Honey gets thrown around her seat a bit and exhorts the driver to be careful. A group of highwaymen are also on the move and one of them creep along behind a cliff to look for potential prey. He spots Honey&#39;s carriage and hastens back to his cronies who follow his lead. He then positions himself alongside the path of Honey&#39;s carriage and aims his guns. However, the carriage hurtles past at such a fast pace that the gunmen gets twisted around himself. Having unravelled he gets on his horse and gives chase along with his gang, all of them shooting non-stop. Eventually, the trunk on the roof of the carriage falls out and the clothes get out and start running away to avoid the hailstorm of bullets. A corset is seen literally &#39;flying&#39; away. Inside the carriage Honey is getting thrown about violently as the driver is flung off his perch and lands on a tall cactus. He slides down wincing as hundreds of thorns break off and lands on a skeleton of a bull. The skeleton suddenly comes to life and goes off at a gallop whilst the rider hangs on for dear life. Back at the saloon, Bosko is still playing the piano when the driver stumbles in and relays the news. He then deflates and collapses dramatically into his pants as his hand grabs a mug of beer and pours it in after himself. Bosko gets on his horse and gallops away to the rescue, the horse leaping noticeably effortlessly over the rocks he seemed to have trouble with earlier. The bandits are still chasing the carriage and Honey leans out of a window and implores Bosko to save her. As Bosko continues to gallop after the run away carriage the scene pans out to show Hugh Harman, Rudolf Ising and one other person watching the cartoon and adding sound effects. They discuss how they can get Bosko to save the girl, when someone says &#34;Let&#39;s go home&#34;. This prompts everyone to exit, leaving Bosko in the lurch.'] ['A man walks along with a Cello under his arm. He then sits down on a stool and proceeds to play it, very badly, while the neighbors proceed throw all manner of things at him to make him stop. At one point, a Couch is thrown at him, but neither this nor any other projectile is a successful deterrent. At the end of the film, a girl comes up to him and gives him some flowers. The man then stops playing and walks off, happy that his talents have been recognised.'] ['Jerry lives in the wall between two apartments, one where Tom lives and the other where Dupli-cat lives. Both cats show they are out to get him. Jerry screws up his courage and steals two of Tom\'s whiskers. He is attacked but tricks Tom into smacking Dupli-cat. He punches back and both cats assume Jerry is a "super-mouse". Jerry trips an arrow aimed at a cheese wheel, it strips the other cat of its fur. Tom ends up furless as well. An armed conflict escalates when Jerry directs the cat\'s fire at each other. Tom rolls a lighted firework into Jerry\'s hole, and Jerry rolls it back out under Tom. Tom hears it hissing under him and raises himself such that he is dazed, but not hurt, by the explosion. Both cats then arm a hand grenade and throw it into the mouse\'s hole, but they hit each other and return to their owners. The two grenades go back and forth until they both explode in their owners\' hands, destroying almost the entire wall. The two cats give up and move out then go to Paris; Jerry whistles and follows.'] ['In an effort to impress Darla , Alfalfa  tells her that he\'s a famous bear trainer.

Tweety angers Sylvester when the bird goes over to a mouse ; Sylvester replies: "Laugh this off" and tries to throw a brick at the window. However, upon seeing a cop walk up behind Sylvester, the would-be puddy vandal runs in front of the brick and absorbs the blow. As Sylvester is planning to cut through the glass window with a glass cutter, a deliveryman takes Tweety away, to be delivered to Granny\'s house. Sylvester follows the deliveryman and rushes into the yard, only to discover a whole army of bulldogs. The rest of the cartoon contains Sylvester\'s attempts  to get at Tweety: * Walking across a tree branch that extends from the outside to the house. Tweety saws the branch off . * Using stilts to walk harmlessly above the dogs. Tweety gives the dogs some tools to cut the stilts down to size; Sylvester tries a hasty retreat but ends up just short of the gate.  * Building a rocket, which simply sets the cat\'s fur aflame. * Riding a bucket attached to a wire that he connected from a telephone pole to the edge of Granny\'s house. Unfortunately, Sylvester\'s weight is too heavy for the bucket\'s support, and the added weight lowers the bucket down to the horde of dogs, where they wait to beat Sylvester up. * Waiting until the yard is empty and then walking unannounced to the house. The dogs run outside and tackle the cat. This time, Sylvester gets away, but before he can catch his breath, a kindly old man - thinking the puddy had simply wandered outside his home - throws him back into the yard, where the dogs beat the cat up some more. * Hiding in a package intended for Granny. The original contents are dog food, which has the dogs so eager. Granny does not take the package in to unwrap,  instead she throws it to the dogs. As she watches the dogs tear open the package to get at their "food," Granny compliments on how hungry they were that she didn\'t have the chance to unwrap the package. Finally, Sylvester decides to wait until the early morning to tip-toe silently through the yard. The alarm clock goes off at 4 a.m., awakening the dogs and pummeling the cat one last time.

Through a chance encounter, two men meet through a mutual friend, Peter, who is arriving late for their meeting. John  is a white British liberal who would have a Black friend if he knew any and Dan  is a Black Briton who understands he lives in a White Society and needs to engage with it to succeed. After being introduced to both characters the film unfolds through the eyes of John and we see how cultural references and shared experiences impact on how he sees Dan\'s skin colour. Through a mundane conversation about work, girlfriends and friendships John gradually watches Dan\'s skin colour go from Idi Amin Black to almost white, as he discovers that they have a lot in common. By the end of the film John, doesn\'t even think about Dan\'s skin colour. In stark contrast, when the audience is shown the world through Dan\'s eyes, John is shown in Golliwog make-up, Blackface and frizzy wig speaking in what the makers of the film refer to as Wigger . Representing that Dan sees white men as constantly parodying his race and eternally racist. The objective of the film was to prompt an informed debate about race. The makers felt that any mention of race in the current political climate is festooned with political correctness and therefore unhelpful in dealing with the real issues that are impacting on the UK today. The implication that Black people were as racist, if not more so, than White people in Britain was designed to be the spark for serious debate around the UK.Breakfast Show, Colourful Radio,Thursday 26th March 2009, Interview with Paul Atherton about Colour Blind'] ['A tribal dancer is caught in his daily struggle of survival in an automobile factory.

Most of the film is simply footage of the newly liberated camps over a score of stark classical music. The narrator notes that people of all nationalities were found in the camps, including people of all religious or political creeds. There is no mention of the particular fate of Jewish people. The film states that 20 million people were killed and describes many of the familiar aspects of the Holocaust, including the medical experiments and the gas chambers.'] ['Introduction: The short starts off with the Coyote waiting behind a rock for the Road Runner to zoom by. Coyote looks at the camera and flutters his eyebrows as Road Runner races by. Coyote starts to chase him to the edge of a cliff. Road Runner produces a sign that says HOLD IT. There are hopscotch marks right at the end of the cliff, which is covered by a cloud. After Roadrunner hopscotches, Coyote takes his turn. But the cloud drifts away and the edge of the cliff breaks. Coyote plummets to the canyon bottom. The battered Coyote looks up at the rim, which is seen from his point of view. Roadrunner is heard going "beep beep" and then zooming off. 1. We then see a shot of Coyote sharpening the spikes on a metal grate. He covers it up with a sheet and raises it up using a pulley. He then climbs down from the top of a rock, and it cuts to Coyote hammering signs into the ground. One says FREE BIRD SEED—200 YARDS, another says BIRD SEED LIKE MOTHER USED TO SERVE—100 YARDS and a third says EAT IN THE SHADE, 20 DEGREES COOLER--followed by Coyote pouring bird-seed into a little bowl with a sign that says FREE BIRD SEED that is under the large sharp spiked grate and disguises it as a shade canopy. He watches from the top of his rock with a pair of binoculars as Roadrunner runs to the bowl of bird seed, gobbles it up in two seconds, and runs off. Coyote gets a stunned look on his face and climbs down to fill the bowl with more bird seed. Unfortunately, the hot sun creates a glare on the lenses of the binoculars he left on top of the rock and it burns the rope holding up the shade canopy. As the Coyote pours more seed into the bowl, he hears creaking, stands up to listen, and slowly looks up in distress just as the canopy falls right on top of him. The sheet from the spiked metal grate makes him look like a banana, in which he starts to "peel." He then gets an idea to create a female road runner. 2. The next scene, we see an ACME LIGHTNING ROD box. Coyote sticks the rod in the ground and puts the female road runner\'s "body" on the middle of the stick. He then sticks on blue hair and a beak and paints eyes on it. Coyote sticks the female "road runner" on the road and uses a Roadrunner "call," hides behind a rock and holds an axe while he waits for Roadrunner to run by to chop him with the axe. He hears the call and runs right by the female "Roadrunner" as he plants a kiss on it. Coyote misses and chops the ground, and this results in the head from the female roadrunner flying off and hitting Coyote on the head. 3. Coyote later walks behind a cliff and emerges wearing Indian tribal clothes. He looks up at the sky and starts doing a rain dance. It soon starts to rain and Coyote looks up with delight. He does another dance and this time, a bolt of lightning zaps the female road runner, just as Coyote runs out of the way. He then uses the Roadrunner call and the real Roadrunner is seen running towards Coyote\'s spot. Wile E. hides behind the cliff and then the Roadrunner stops when he sees the female Roadrunner. He tiptoes towards her and leans in close to her. Wile E. then frenetically beats his drum, then unfurls an umbrella, and there\'s another lightning bolt, but unfortunately it misses the Road runner and his "girlfriend" and hits Coyote\'s umbrella. Burnt to a crisp, he stands there, still holding his  umbrella.'] ['An on-screen title sets the action in Korea, 1951. The film tells the story of a young boy, Manuk, who roams a seemingly deserted town to glean and recycle the debris of war. We first meet him in the wreck of an aeroplane, looking for a particular piece of war refuse – a bolt – to turn into a toy soldier for his collection. He sings a song about a bear. Upon hearing the unmistakable low whistle of a train in the distance he runs to the track and places the bolt on the rail. The train thunders past on its urgent mission to carry tanks to the front. Manuk stands mesmerised, and grins widely. Once the train has passed he retrieves the bolt which has become magnetised. He makes his way through the town, pretending to be a soldier engaged in house-to-house fighting, until his attention is captured by the drone of aeroplane engines. Silently he watches them slowly cross the sky. His war game begins again as he crouches behind rocks on a ridge overlooking an area with houses jumbled together. A postman cycles down the road below Manuk’s hiding place. Manuk imagines he is with his dad, pinned down by enemy fire. “Dad, there are too many of them,” he cries as the sound of machine guns and artillery fire fill his head. “But we are braver than them,” his father replies in the game. Manuk picks up a rock as if it is a hand grenade, expertly pulls the pin with his teeth and hurls it at the enemy crying “Dad, get down!” He waits, crouched, fingers in ears for the explosion which never comes. Instead we hear the postman cry in surprise and pain, before crashing his bicycle and shouting at his unseen tormentor. Manuk slinks away, and climbs the hill towards his home. He takes a key from a special hiding spot, and approaches the verandah in front of his house. He notices a parcel, and hurries to open it. He pulls out an old leather wallet containing a faded black and white photograph of a man crouching with a child dressed as Manuk is now, but much younger. Manuk gently caresses the photograph with his thumb. He then pulls out a set of dog tags, and an old boot. He marches up and down in front of his house, wearing the boots, as if he is a soldier on guard. Later, inside the house, he plays with the toy soldiers and tanks he has made from bits and pieces of metal he has found, and falls asleep on the floor. His mother appears at the door, saying “Manuk, Mum is home”. The film is set in Korea, during the war that pitched the north of the country and its allies China and the Soviet Union, against the south and a United Nations coalition led by the United States of America which included more than 17,000 Australian army and air force personnel. But the film is not ‘about’ the war as such , and is certainly not about the Australian experience of this conflict. Neither is it an explicit comment on the conflict in Iraq which began the year before the film was finished. Rather it is about the impact of war on those left behind, and so has a much more universal and timeless appeal. Part of what is exciting about the film from an Australian perspective is that it does not allude to the usual iconography or correspond with the kinds of social and cultural experiences that typically mark films from this country. It does not allude to local histories of storytelling, or overtly suggest that it can tell us something about what it means to be Australian, and yet it tells us so much about these things by telling a story from, about and set in a different place and culture. As Sung-Ae Lee has argued in a reading of the coverage of the film and its success in Korean language newspapers in Sydney, the film provided the opportunity for the celebration of diasporic achievement and success, for cultural maintenance through its remembering of the Korean War, and for empowerment of the diasporic community . At the same time, the allusions to other films, the subtlety of the film’s style as expressed through camerawork, editing, sound and music as well as mastery of digital animation techniques and a structure familiar from mainstream Hollywood cinema mark the film as a knowing and learned contribution to international screen culture. The film is divided into four parts of roughly equal length and an epilogue, a structure familiar from mainstream Hollywood cinema but not so usual in Australian short filmmaking . In the first part, the setup, the protagonist, Manuk, and his world are established. Manuk’s series of overlapping goals are not all made obvious in this part, which runs up to the point that we  first hear the train. He is clearly very young, too young to tell us what is happening; we must piece together the story ourselves. One of the pleasures of Birthday Boy is realising how much of the story is seeded early on but only gradually revealed, and only able to be fully assembled in the climax, to devastating final effect. Manuk’s primary goal is to be reunited with his father, to be with and like him, a soldier at war. The games he plays throughout the film revolve around this goal, most obviously in the scene with the postman, in which Manuk’s inadvertent assault on the hapless cyclist is the result of a game in which he imagines he is with his father attacking an unseen enemy. His search for the piece of metal in this opening part of the film is also directed towards the goal of reuniting with his father, if only symbolically through his imaginative play with the soldiers and tanks he builds with scavenged metal, his trophies of war. His broadest, loosest goal is to play and to occupy the time he must spend alone – perhaps after school – until his mother returns home. He must make his own entertainment, and he is resourceful. He is driven by the desire to play, and this is what is enchanting about him. He is imaginative and mechanically savvy, but still too young to understand what the return of his father’s possessions means.'] ["Hoping to get an early start on a fishing trip to the East River, the gang boards a double-decker bus at the crack of dawn. Alas, the kids' bulky fishing equipment causes nothing but discomfort for the rest of the passengers, to say nothing of the irascible bus conductor.

As the "lady" completes her boudoir, she lifts her skirts to reveal a thick patch of pubic hair. At this point, an intertitle reveals that the screenwriter is "Oscar Wild" . The "lady" goes into the drawing room and offers her well-attired gentleman caller  a drink. He refuses it, and she drinks the cocktail. They talk briefly, and then engage in passionate kissing. Whenever the gentleman caller puts his hands on the "lady\'s" breasts or genitals, "she" pushes his hand away. Finally, she slaps him coyly. The "lady" then apologizes for her aggressiveness by fellating her partner. The "lady" then lies face-down on the sofa with her buttocks in the air. It is revealed that she has no underwear on. The gentleman caller then copulates the "lady" anally . After a minute or so, the gentleman withdraws and sits back on the sofa. The "lady" gyrates her buttocks in the air.

He chooses Bugs Bunny as his intended victim. The lion soon finds out that, in a battle of wits, he is the defenseless one. However, the lion eventually gets Bugs under one paw while raising the other one, claws extended, and looking angry; a truly frightened-looking Bugs could be facing his end. Just then the lion gets a phone call from his wife, changing the lion\'s demeanor from ferocious to meek. He apologizes to Bugs that he can\'t "stay and kill him," and then dashes home. Bugs ridicules the lion\'s apparent submissiveness, but we soon see that he has someone to answer to as well: his own wife, who sends Bugs slinking into the rabbit hole while "Mrs. Bugs Bunny"  shows the audience that she "wears the pants in this family." Mrs. Bugs\' higher-pitched voice is similar to that of Tweety Bird minus the speech impediment. It is the sole appearance of a Mrs. Bugs Bunny, as Bugs is ever afterward depicted as a bachelor but recently is depicted with a sweetheart, Lola.'] ['After being found innocent on a charge of chicken stealing, the Stooges attempt to catch a live fish from a pet store aquarium tank.

He\'s hopping around on all fours and acting like a rabbit. Fudd snaps into a moment of paranoid delusion, expressing worry and fright over hunters who are out to get him. The board of directors agrees that Fudd needs help. Soon Elmer, now wearing a rabbit suit, is committed to The Fruitcake Sanitarium  for treatment of his apparent mental illness. A few moments later, Elmer sees Bugs Bunny walk by—in this cartoon, as in a few others, the two do not seem to be pre-acquainted—and lures him to the window with a carrot. Bugs naively says "You mean I can have that, and plenty more? And all I have to do is to open the window?" Bugs goes inside, takes the bribe, and Elmer hops out the window. Bugs lies in Elmer\'s bed to "keep it warm for him." Bugs then notices the medicine beside him and reads the instructions , but he misinterprets the instructions and ingests the spoon instead! The Austrian hospital psychiatrist  comes for Elmer, but notices Bugs in his place; Myicin, having already diagnosed Elmer with "a clear case of rabbitschenia" , declares the apparent transformation of Elmer into Bugs as the "vurst case I\'ve evah zeen!" When Myicin tries to convince Bugs he is Elmer Fudd, Bugs at first believes Myicin is identifying himself as Fudd, and politely shakes hands saying "Pleased to meet you, Mr. Fudd!" Myicin then says: "No, I em naut Elmer J. Fudd, you ah Elmer J. Fudd!" Realizing the doctor\'s intent, Bugs presumes it is Myicin who is insane. Bugs momentary shows the audience a card with a screw and ball , then attempts to psychoanalyze the doctor instead. Irked, Myicin gives Bugs a hypnotizing "kapzule." Once it takes effect, Bugs is made to repeat, over and over: "I am Elmer J. Fudd, millionaire. I own a mansion and a yacht," gradually acquiring Elmer\'s speech pattern. Myicin\'s programming works: Bugs Bunny leaves the sanitarium convinced he\'s Elmer Fudd and adopts his speech impediment, pronouncing R\'s and L\'s as W\'s. Myicin telephones Elmer\'s chauffeur ordering him not to be put off by the rabbit appearance and to get Elmer back into the lifestyle he knew before the delusion. The chauffer tells Bugs that since it is Wednesday, he brought the hunting clothes. Bugs decides to relax by going hunting, where Elmer, still in his rabbit suit, is waiting. It\'s the usual chase from there, only in reverse. Notable gags include Elmer siccing a bear on Bugs and telling him to play dead; the bear, concluding from Bugs\' body odor that he is indeed dead, buries Bugs, who then falls from the underside of a cliff ledge. In the climax, Bugs is about to capture Elmer  when a government agent (dressed in film noir [[G-man  taps Bugs on the shoulder, asking: "Pardon me, did you say you were Elmer J. Fudd?" Bugs replies with the phrase that turned him into Elmer. "Yes, I am Ewmew J. Fudd, miwwionaiwe. I own a mansion and a yacht." Bugs is then arrested for Elmer\'s non-payment of $300,000  in back taxes, and tries in vain to explain himself, protesting, "I\'m hunting a scwewy wabbit!" This time, the last line of the episode belongs to Elmer: "I may be a scwewy wabbit, but I\'m not going to Alcatwaz", as he jauntily does the bunny hop into the distance.'] ['A butterfly collector unwittingly wanders into an Indian encampment while chasing a butterfly.

Disguised as Santa, Pooh sneaks out and delivers Tigger, Rabbit, and Eeyore a super-bouncer barrel, a bug sprayer, and a mobile home, respectively - or rather, handmade versions of said items that break apart upon use. Demanding to know what is going on, the three of them corner "Santa", who insists that he is who he claims to be.

Scrooge, being his typical stingy self, goes into a rant of "A dollar forty-nine! That is a lot of money!" and instead give an old trophy of his he thinks is worthless, but the boys pass the curator of the Duckburg Museum who sees it is a rare artifact worth a million dollars, causing Scrooge to gain the reputation as a generous philanthropist throughout Duckburg. To win back the trophy, Scrooge is now made to sponsor his nephews, where he is taken to a sporting goods store owned by a surprisingly athletic and agile Goofy. Scrooge enlists the aid of Goofy, soon known by the nickname of "Sport Goofy", who ends becoming the team\'s coach when the teammates of Scrooge\'s nephews are shown as ragtag misfits. The team christened the "McDuck Greenbacks", come together under Goofy\'s patient coaching and sharpen their soccer skills, and register to compete in the tournament. Unfortunately, the Beagle Boys know of the trophy\'s value, and sought to enter the soccer tournament as well in order to "walk away with the trophy, all nice and legal", rather than steal it. When one of the Beagle Boys comments they are out of shape and do not know anything about soccer, their leader says all they have to do is cheat. The tournament comes down to the McDuck Greenbacks facing the Beagle Boys in the finals; the Beagles decide Sport Goofy is a problem and kidnap him. The team is disheartened by the loss of their coach and team captain, but resolve to go on without him. Despite the excellent playing by the team members, the Beagle Boys engage in outright cheating and a nearsighted referee keeps declaring the Beagles\' goals legit, ending the first half with a score of 10-0. Sport Goofy quietly escapes the Beagles\' hideout and gets to the field for the second half. The return of Sport Goofy encourages the Greenbacks into incredible playing that not even the Beagles\' cheating can counter, causing a comeback of 10-10. When the enraged Beagles resort to outright physically assaulting Sport Goofy, Scrooge finally makes the referee wear his glasses and see what is happening, causing the ref to cry foul and set up a penalty shot with only Sport Goofy and the Beagles\' goalie. The Beagles\' team captain has secretly placed a bomb in the ball, and orders a Beagle to push the red button on the detonator when Goofy is ready to take his shot. Unfortunately, that Beagle is so uneducated he keeps pushing the green button, causing Sport Goofy to easily make the penalty goal past an overconfident goalie, thus the Greenbacks win 11-10. All of Duckburg rejoices except for the Beagles, whose angry captain pushes the red button causing the ball to explode and send all the Beagle Boys into a waiting police van. Now that Scrooge has his trophy back, he donates it to the Duckburg Museum, and joins the McDuck Greenbacks in their championship photo.'] ["A seated woman, alone in a chair at a table in a room on one of the top floors of an asylum, repeatedly writes on a piece of paper and sharpens pencils.

Red is voiced by Daws Butler, and is a takeoff on Jackie Gleason\'s "Loudmouth" character, Charlie Bratten . Foghorn decides that he had enough of "that loudmouth" Red in college, and puts up several signs and barbed wire outside the barnyard fence to discourage Red from visiting. Meanwhile, Foghorn does not realize that the delivery man that brought the telegram is actually Red in disguise, so Red sees everything that Foghorn is trying to do to prevent his visit. Foghorn sees Red, who extends his arm for a handshake. Foghorn shakes hands and receives an electrical shock from an unseen joke buzzer in Red\'s hand. Red then pulls another joke by squirting Foghorn with a fake carnation on his lapel. Red sees the hens and tries to impress them by singing and playing a rendition of Freddy the Freshman. Foghorn tries to get back at Red by rigging a camera with a boxing glove in it and asking the self-absorbed Red if he wants to have his picture taken. Red obliges, but Foghorn cannot get the glove to fire from the camera. Red then reverses positions with Foghorn and gets him to squeeze the shutter mechanism on the camera, which causes Foghorn to get punched by the glove. Foghorn then falls backwards into a hole that he dug and is hit on the head by a boulder, traps that were intended for Red. Foghorn breaks the fourth wall by looking at the viewer and saying: "I thought I had a sitting duck, turns out he had a pigeon." Red then asks if Foghorn is going to take his picture and this time Foghorn gets behind the camera and points a double-barreled shotgun at Red, who puts his fingers into each barrel, causing the shotgun to backfire on Foghorn.  Red is then seen walking with the hens outside of the barnyard and asks them if they want to see the "star halfback at Chicken Tech" in action.

She asks which students are planning to participate; most raise their hands, but two children do not.

They describe a range of energy-saving measures which have been implemented by the team and its fans. However, the coach is uninterested, remarking that he would rather just concentrate on football. A player tells him that there\'s "no pressure", produces a detonator and blows him up.

The sound engineer asks her what she is planning to do to cut her carbon footprint. Anderson explains that she thought providing the recording was a sufficient contribution. The sound engineer repeats the film\'s catchphrase, "no pressure", and detonates Anderson.

Jerry next hides in a badminton shuttlecock and tries to sneak onto the table, but Tom hits him with a racket. The shuttlecock gets caught in the net and rebounds into Clint's mouth, whereupon he breaks the racket over Tom's head. Tom then tries to stop Jerry from opening a freshly shaken bottle of Kooky Kola, but he is too late; the soda ruins one of Clint's steaks, so Tom is forced to gulp down a second shaken bottle. Once Tom recovers, he chases Jerry across the yard only to get his tail trapped in the grill. Tom dashes across the backyard, still attached to the grill, knocking Clint over in the process. He dives into the swimming pool to cool off, prompting Clint to tie him to a lounge chair so he will stay out of trouble. Jerry hooks the chair to the rear bumper of a passing car at a stop light just before the car drives away, taking Tom and the chair with it. Finally, Clint goes back to his grilling in peace, and Jerry reaches the table and starts eating one of the steaks."] ["A new kid moves into town and is soon bullying little Jackie.

Feeling guilty that the hotel is in honor of what the majority of Earth believes to be his defeat of Buu, he invites all of the Z-Fighters and their families to a banquet. Goku and Vegeta decide to spar, as they have dressed in their usual fighting outfits. Shortly after dinner, two Saiyan spaceships land just outside of town, and a mysterious Saiyan and his wife confront the Z-Fighters at the hotel. They are revealed to be Vegeta\'s younger brother, Tarble, who had been deemed too weak to fight in the past and was sent to a distant star before the destruction of Planet Vegeta, and his wife Gure, who is a small, cartoon-like alien. Tarble asks his brother for help in dealing with Abo and Cado, soldiers who are remnants of Frieza\'s army, who are causing havoc on his planet. Goku and Vegeta argue over who will fight the brothers. Even their sons and friends offer to join in, but so many fighting two people seems unfair, so Goku comes up with an idea to solve the issue. As Abo and Cado land, the Z-Fighters pick radishes from Goku and Chi Chi\'s garden to determine who will battle the duo. Everyone picks short radishes until Goten picks out the apparent longest. Jealous, Vegeta tells Trunks to pick one that is longer. Pressured by his father, Trunks picks out what appears to be a short radish, but it turns out to be the longest, stretching all the way down to the mountain. This means that Trunks wins and is chosen to fight, and the battle begins. However, Abo and Cado are two opponents and Goku asks Vegeta to let Goten fight with Trunks, but Vegeta says that Trunks is enough. Nevertheless, Goku lets Goten join Trunks, which prompts an angry outburst from Vegeta, who relents after his wife persuades him to agree. When the battle begins, without going Super Saiyan, the children easily defeat the two soldiers. However, when Abo and Cado create doubles of themselves, the boys get beaten easily. Irritated, Vegeta shouts at Trunks to read their ki and says that Trunks has forgotten the basics. When his wife says it is because he never taught Trunks basics, Vegeta says he lacks motivation like her, starting an argument between them which prompts Goku to say that it\'s not the time for a "marital quarrel". With a little help from Goten\'s brother Gohan, he and Trunks are able to fight and seem to have the upper hand. Everyone except for Goku, Vegeta, and Piccolo go back to the hotel. As the battle is almost over, Abo and Cado fuse into their larger, more powerful form, Aka. Aka easily devastates Goten and Trunks, slamming them around and tossing them like rag dolls, and everyone comes back. Goten and Trunks try to fuse; while the first is a failure, the second is successful, and they become Gotenks. Gotenks attacks with "Wolf Fang Fist", "Volleyball Fist" and one of his signature moves: "Dynamite Rolling Thunder Punch", which appears to defeat Aka. However, while everyone is celebrating, Aka attacks the boys again with a super move, "Super Destructive Wave", after Gotenks taunts him. Piccolo blocks the attack with a "Special Beam Cannon". Infuriated, Aka destroys most of the hotel with "Wahahanoha" beams while Gotenks protects Tarble and Gure. Seeing Aka\'s threat growing, Goku and Vegeta join the fight, but Goku tricks Vegeta into looking away while he defeats Aka with a final "Kamehameha". With the battle over, Mr. Satan mourns the loss of his hotel. His daughter Videl  tells him that this serves as a lesson, and he promises to change. Everyone goes back to what\'s left of the hotel, where their banquet is still waiting. Abo and Cado give up the fight, and join them in the feast. The special ends with Goku and Vegeta fighting over pork and sushi, even going Super Saiyan as they argue, much to the amusement of their friends but the embarrassment of their wives.'] ["{{tone}} Jane  is a secretary who doesn't know that her life is being filmed and shown in theaters, or that those who are closest to her are in on it.

While Scrooge\'s selfish thoughts cascade in his head, Bob Cratchit , exhausted and underpaid (a meager two shillings and a [[Halfpenny , continues to work long and hard for him. Cratchit reluctantly asks for a "half day off" for Christmas, to which Scrooge replies it will be unpaid. When collectors Rat and Mole, along with beggars on the streets, kindly ask for a simple donation, Scrooge responds to Rat and Mole that if he does, the poor will no longer be poor and thus they  will be out of work, "and you [can\'t] ask me to do that, not on Christmas Eve." Scrooge\'s cheery nephew Fred  invites his crotchety uncle to a holiday feast fit for a Roman emperor -- roast goose with chestnut dressing, candied fruits, and cinnamon cake with lemon glaze. Scrooge turns him down flat, stating that such rich festive cuisine gives him digestive and other health difficulties. Later, Scrooge is visited by the ghost of Jacob Marley , Scrooge\'s greedy former business partner who has died seven years earlier. Due to his cruelty in life, he is doomed to wear heavy chains for eternity. He warns that a similar fate will befall Scrooge unless he changes his ways and that Scrooge will be visited by three spirits. Marley then leaves, falling down the stairs when he tries to avoid tripping over Scrooge\'s cane again. The first spirit, the Ghost of Christmas Past , shows Scrooge his past. His obsession of money led him to break the heart of his fiancee Isabelle  by foreclosing on the honeymoon cottage\'s mortgage.

Bob\'s young son, Tiny Tim, is revealed to be ill, and Willie foretells tragedy if the family\'s hapless life does not change. However, just when Scrooge is desperate to know Tim\'s fate, the Ghost of Christmas Present and the house disappear. The third and final spirit, Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come (a hooded figure later revealed to be [[Pete , takes Scrooge to the future in a graveyard. When he sees Bob mourning Tiny Tim\'s death, Scrooge is horrified and asks whether this future can be changed. Two gravediggers  are amused that no one attended Scrooge\'s funeral while digging his grave. After the weasels leave to take a break from their work, the ghost reveals Scrooge\'s grave by lighting a match. The ghost shoves him into his grave calling him "the richest man in the cemetery." Despite his pleas that he will repent, Scrooge falls into an empty coffin. However, Scrooge suddenly awakens on Christmas Day. Having been given another chance, he throws his coat over his nightshirt, dons his cane and top hat, and goes to visit the Cratchits, cheerfully donating generous amounts of money along the way  and telling Fred that he will come after all. He tries to play a ninny on Bob, dragging in a large sack supposedly filled with laundry and announcing gruffly that there will be extra work in the future. But to the Cratchits\' joy, the sack is instead filled with toys and a big turkey for dinner. Scrooge gives Bob a raise and makes him his partner in the counting house, and Tiny Tim proclaims "God bless us, everyone!"'] ["Betty Boop is baking a cake, when Irving the practical joker comes for a visit.

Meanwhile, agents of the Pretzelstrass meet with the Count  to devise a plan to get at Colonel Nutt\'s device. Charlie carelessly dumps garbage all over the maid  and her newly clean floor. He takes the trash can and dumps it over the fence, inundating the Count in the process. Back in the kitchen, the maid scolds Charlie, but then becomes emotional, and he comforts her. The Count enters the house, and is hit by a wet rag thrown by the maid, intended for Charlie. The Count tosses it off to the side, and it winds up hitting the cook also, and when the cook begins to act cruelly towards the maid in return, Charlie sticks up for her. The Count makes his way to the Colonel, who rejects his offers and has the Count ejected by way of the butler. His day\'s work done, Charlie makes his way to a flophouse for a night\'s sleep. At this point, a pickpocket  holds up the Count, but instead of taking his money he agrees to join the caper to liberate Dr. Nutt of his invention. The conversation is overheard by a cop, who then runs off to inform his fellow officers; they are in an abandoned lot, shooting craps. They storm the Nutt house, and highly disrupt its resident, but explain to him that they "are on the trail of a great robbery." Back at the flophouse, Charlie is prevented from settling down by a loud, singing drunk  whom he eventually—and somewhat affectionately—dispatches with a champagne bottle. A thief  steals in during the night and robs the singing drunk, and although Charlie takes what he thinks are adequate precautions, he is robbed also.

The mouse wakes up and hears the knock again, to his fright, but sees it\'s actually a knock at his door and goes out to open it. There is basket on his front door; Jerry does not notice when he peeks out the first time, and then widens his eyes in puzzlement. He pokes the basket, and it comes alive, runs in circles through Jerry\'s home, and then runs into a wall. Jerry pulls the blanket off to reveal it is Nibbles. Wondering what to do with him, he picks up the note attached, which says, “Please take care of Little Nibbles---He’s always hungry! P.S. Feed him lots of milk". Nibbles then confirms he\'s hungry by licking his lips and rubbing his belly. Seeing that he has no food anywhere in his hole, Jerry tells Nibbles to be quiet and he tiptoes out of his hole, spotting Tom asleep by his bowl of milk. Nibbles sees the milk and runs toward it; Jerry repeatedly grabs the smaller mouse and pulls him back into the hole until he is forced to hang Nibbles on a hook by his diaper. Jerry then tells Nibbles to stay put, and goes out to the kitchen to get the milk for his younger protege. Meanwhile, the disobedient Nibbles has caught up and passed Jerry. The bigger mouse doesn\'t notice until Nibbles climbs on Tom’s nose and jumps onto the rim of Tom’s bowl. Nibbles loses his balance and has to hang onto one of Tom’s whiskers, which causes Tom to wake up. Before the cat can open his eyes and see them, Jerry grabs Nibbles and the two land in the milk, splashing it in Tom\'s face. Tom, startled, looks around and sees no one, so he starts to drink his milk. Jerry and Nibbles are under the milk holding their breath until Tom unsuspectingly scoops up Nibbles with his tongue. In horror, Jerry jumps out of the milk and bluntly opens the cat\'s mouth to retrieve Nibbles, which begins the chase. Jerry is holding Nibbles as he runs, but Tom starts to catch up, so Nibbles switches positions until they reach the mousehole. Nibbles is safe, but Jerry bumps his head on the wall just above the mousehole. Fortunately, Nibbles quickly pulls him into the hole before Tom crashes headfirst into the wall. With the direct attempt having failed, Jerry builds a pipe bridge to the milk by stringing straws together all the way into the bowl. However, Tom is alert and opens one eye to see the end of the straws land in the bowl, and to hear and see milk being sucked out of his bowl. Knowing this is a hungry Nibbles, Tom turns the tables by grabbing the other end of the straw and drinking through it, sucking Nibbles through the straws in an attempt to eat him. Seeing the rapidly-worsening situation, Jerry squishes the very end of the straw, saving Nibbles just in time, and blows the small mouse into the mousehole. Extremely angry at this turn of events, the cat chases Jerry into his hole until Tom moves the hole over so that Jerry crashes into the wall. Tom grabs Jerry, but Nibbles comes out to make the save by hitting Tom’s tail with a hammer. The chase starts up again until Jerry signals for Tom to stop, while Nibbles sips and spits some milk into Tom\'s face. Jerry and Nibbles hide in a closet, while Tom hammers on the door. Seeing a chance to use deception, Jerry uses a container of shoe polish he discovers to disguise himself and Nibbles as a pair of black people. Emerging from the closet, Jerry, dressed in headscarf and in blackface  greets Tom. Out comes Nibbles, also in blackface and wearing a headscarf. However, the disguise is revealed when Nibbles\' diaper falls down, exposing his tail and gray fur. The chase continues, eventually leading to Jerry grabbing a frying pan and hitting Tom in the face with it, knocking him out. Jerry sadistically pulls out Tom\'s tongue, and with all his strength knocks the cat in the head, causing him to chomp his tongue. Tom yells and the chase begins again. Jerry hands the frying pan to Nibbles and allows himself to be chased through the room repeatedly. However, instead of Nibbles whacking the cat when the pair are in range, he swings too soon and smashes his comrade. This repeats a second time, but on the third time around, Jerry stops and points at the cat. Nibbles obliges and hits Tom square in the face, then crawls under the rug to escape along with Jerry. Tom grabs a bottle to trap the mice in as they emerge, but picks it up too soon and collects only Jerry in the bottle. Nibbles taunts the cat and darts back under the rug, while Tom puts a stack of books on top of the bottle and goes under the rug to get Nibbles. However, as soon as he emerges, he meets a pie placed at the exit by Nibbles. The cat chases him until he stops at Tom’s bowl again, signals for the cat to stop, and starts to drink from it. Tom, after allowing the mouse to drink briefly, grabs Nibbles. But when he opens his hands, Nibbles has crawled under Tom’s fur. Therefore, Tom grabs his tail and a pistol and shoots at Nibbles when he emerges from it, but just shoots his tail instead, which, of course, causes him to scream in agony. As Nibbles runs away, the cat chases him with a flyswatter and successfully corners him. He gives him a good swat on the behind, but this proves unwise, causing an angry Jerry to run directly through the glass to inspect his nephew. Tom\'s swat left a big red mark, and Jerry is furious about it. He faces Tom with no mercy. Seeing he has pushed Jerry too far, Tom pathetically hides the flyswatter behind his back and Jerry, not fooled in the slightest, lets out a massive bull roar, which scares Tom to literally turn yellow with fear, and he attempts to run away in panic, but Jerry catches him on time, attacks and grabs him by the tail before he can escape, slams the cat against the floor three times, throws him behind a garbage can, and pops open the lid into the cat\'s face repeatedly, over and over and over and over and over again. In the final scene, a still-incensed Jerry is shown standing over an Tom\'s shoulder with a wooden meat tenderizer to keep the cat in line under threat of being whacked, while a bandaged and bruised Tom timidly spoon-feeds milk to Nibbles as punishment for what he did to the little mouse, not to let even one drop spill, or else...'] [' Having read about the U.S. fighting forces pushing the Nazi troops back during World War II , Daffy is in a patriotic mood.

Part 1 begins with the video recalling the start of Episode IV: A New Hope with an Imperial Star Destroyer pursuing the Tantive IV. Following the intrusion of Imperial Stormtroopers, Jar Jar Binks appears as a janitor wiping the floor of ship. At this point everyone freezes as Jar jar passes by, and after leaving, the fighting resumes as the Rebel troopers are shot backward. Afterwards, Darth Vader walks in but slips on the wet floor; he lands on his back and is taken away on a stretcher while Jar Jar puts up a wet floor sign. Meanwhile, on the Star Destroyer, Darth Vader has a cast on both his left arm and leg. As he watches Lego Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Brick, Vader hires Boba Fett to eliminate Jar Jar, switching channels to reveal a mug shot of Jar Jar.

Landing on the Death Star, Chewbacca can be seen taken away by stormtroopers. After they left, Jar Jar leaves the ship, unaware of Boba Fett. While vacuuming a corridor, Boba takes aim but is interrupted by Han Solo chasing two stormtroopers. Once again taking aim at Jar Jar, Boba is once again interrupted by a squad of stormtroopers chasing Han. Boba then sees Indiana Jones running by but is too slow and gets run over by a boulder. As Jar Jar starts playing with the vacuum like a guitar, he gets carried away and his hand is reaching closer and closer to the Self Destruct button for the Death Star. Boba yells, trying to get Jar Jar\'s attention but it is too late. Jar Jar presses the button and a Self Destruct display of the Death begins with a three second countdown.

He then returns to each of his twins, removes the chairs and then disappears.'] ['Grandpa George tells a story about Wally P. Nezzer, the owner of a toy company, who is spreading the word via television commercial that the meaning of Christmas is to get more and more toys. After seeing this, the Dinkletown kids were whining about wanting more toys. He explains to his assistant  that this is a strategy to create demand for his toys in order to boost sales. The toy in question is called “Buzz-Saw Louie,” the only toy featuring an actual working buzz saw built into his right arm. On Christmas Eve, while most of the Veggie children are filled with a mad desire for the new toy, Larry, Bob, and Junior go sledding. They happen upon a lone Buzz-Saw Louie toy that has questioned Mr. Nezzer’s values and escaped the factory to find the true meaning of Christmas. Bob suggests that they go see Grandpa George. George reads the Gospel according to Luke Chapter 2: verses 8-14 in the Contemporary English Version which is as follows: "That night in the fields near Bethlehem, some shepherds were guarding their sheep. All at once an angel came down to them from the Lord and the brightness of the Lord\'s glory flashed around them. The shepherds were frightened. But the angel said, \'Don\'t be afraid! I have good news for you which will make everyone happy. This very day in King David\'s hometown, a Savior was born for you. He is Christ the Lord. You will know who he is because you will find him dressed in baby clothes and lying on a bed of hay.\' Suddenly many other angels came down from heaven and joined in praising God They said, \'Praise God in heaven! Peace on earth to everyone who pleases God.\'" In this, George explains to them that the true meaning of Christmas is not to get, but to give, the way God gave us Jesus, the greatest gift of all. The children are heartened by the news, but puzzle about how to tell the rest of the Veggies before Christmas Day. The story is interrupted by a Silly Song entitled "Oh Santa!" Larry is staying up late awaiting the arrival of Santa Claus, eager to give him some home-made cookies. Instead of Santa, however, he is visited first by a bank robber , then by a Viking , and finally by an agent of the IRS . They all take refuge is his home and eat his cookies . Santa  finally shows up, but rather than being jolly he angrily chases after Scallion #1 and Pa Grape for stealing his "Belt" and "Hat." Larry is left without any cookies, and no Santa or friends. Returning to the story, the characters\' solution is to sneak into Mr. Nezzer’s toy factory and use his television studio to broadcast the message to all the surrounding towns. The plan is a huge success, except that Mr. Nezzer finds them out and threatens to get rid of them. He ties them to a sled and is about to send them downhill into a deep ravine when the other Veggie families intervene. Laura Carrot shows him kindness by giving him a gift, and he quickly repents the errors of his ways. However, the sled with Bob, Larry, Junior, and Louie is accidentally sent on its fateful course in the process but the Dinkletown kids were begging for more toys.

After dropping the anchor, a sea lion assumes they're playing catch and brings the anchor back. Barney tricks the sea lion into swimming the other way by pretending to throw the anchor in one direction, then throws in another. He goes with it because his foot was tied to the rope, but the sea lion saves him. A fish is stuck in Barney's suit, in which the sea lion, in an attempt to catch the fish with a trident, pokes Barney's backside. The fish gets out of Barney's suit, lands back in the water and the sea lion aides Barney in catching it. After chasing it into a cave, the sea lion unsuccessfully warns Barney of an oncoming shark, and flees. The shark pulls up behind him and bumps Barney's bottom, which Barney thinks is more of the sea lion's goading; he turns around and angers the shark by poking him with the trident. Barney tries evading the shark by pretending to be an underwater king, which fails. Barney tries hiding under a rock, which is soon revealed to be an octopus that swims away in fear, and the shark tries eating Barney. The sea lion tries to stop it, by keeping the jaws open, to which the shark's teeth nibbles Barney in the rear. Barney and the sea lion get back to the boat with the shark in pursuit. The shark uses its fin to saw the boat in half and Barney tries reconnecting it. Using its tail as a propeller, the shark strikes the boat. Just before the shark finally eats Barney, the anchor bangs the shark on the head and Barney and the Sea Lion use the shark to ride back to land."] ['Sicily, 1943.

The Dawg sees that Foghorn cannot leave and takes advantage of the situation by lobbing a watermelon at him, which breaks over Foghorn\'s head.

The Draags are an alien species which is humanoid in shape but a hundred times larger than humans, with blue skin, fan-like earlobes and huge, protruding red eyes. The Draags also live much longer than human beings – one Draag week equals a human year. Some Oms are domesticated as pets, but others run wild, and are periodically exterminated. The Draags\' treatment of the Oms is ironically contrasted with their high level of technological and spiritual development. The story opens with a woman running, occasionally looking behind her as if pursued. An enormous hand descends and blocks her way. She runs back the way she came and finds her way blocked by another hand. It becomes apparent that she is being toyed with by entities that do not appreciate her fragility, and as she dies, the infant she has been carrying and attempting to protect begins to cry. The view changes to reveal the Draag children who have accidentally killed the woman; they leave quickly when an adult Draag and child approach. The child voices concern for the orphaned infant, and the two take the child to their home. Tiva  names the infant Terr . Her father, whom the adult Terr voice-over explains is master Sinh, the Draag great Aedile, attaches a collar capable of physically dragging Terr back from mischief, and over the next several scenes, their relationships develop. Terr witnesses the parents seemingly ingesting food by inhaling it from a device. After changing Terr\'s costume as one would a doll\'s, Tiva uses makeup to give herself a more Om-like appearance. When Terr impishly trades dark pigment for light, Tiva blows some of the powder on him. Tiva uses a tiny indoor weather-maker to cause a small storm cloud to form over Terr and chase him around the dwelling. Tiva takes Terr for a walk, and then teaches him how, under certain circumstances, crystals will form on stationary objects, including standing bipeds. She also teaches him that whistling will shatter the crystals. Terr happens upon master Sinh as he and several compatriots are melding in a ritual, and it is revealed that many Draag children have Oms like Terr when they convene to watch their respective Oms interact. Tiva\'s education is supplied by the use of a headset that transmits knowledge directly into the brain of the user. Because she enjoys having Terr in her hand when she is having her "infos," Terr begins to acquire their knowledge. Meanwhile, at the seat of government, Draag Councilors discuss whether the regular extermination of the wild Oms is sufficient to keep their numbers at an acceptable level. It is revealed that Oms were first found on a planet that retained some evidence of structured life, but the images seem to reveal that Earth was in a post-apocalyptic state at the time. Terr decides to escape, and to take the headset with him. He does not get very far before Tiva realizes he is missing, and her mother tells her to use her bracelet to bring him back. Terr finds himself suddenly being dragged backward by the collar. Only the headset becoming entangled in plants allows a wild female Om to come to his rescue before he is choked by the collar or dragged all the way back. When Terr explains that the headset contains the knowledge of the Draags but he doesn\'t know where to go with it, his unnamed rescuer takes him to her tribe, who live in a tree in a walled park. When it is demonstrated that Terr can read Draag script, the leader  is willing to accept Terr into the tribe, but the Wizard is not, and demands a trial by combat – to the death. Terr and the Wizard\'s champion have child-sized animals bound to their torsos in such a way as to prevent the combatants from using anything but the beaks of said animals to attack. Terr is injured, but wins the trial. Over the next several scenes, it is shown how the Oms have adapted to life on the Draags\' planet. Snail-like animals weave clothes onto the Oms, predators that would eat Oms are in turn hunted and efficiently stripped of useful materials, and the gene pool is kept well-mixed. Oms even make the occasional foray into Draag areas in search of resources. Returning from one such expedition, the group of adventurers is accosted by bandits who drop clawlike harpoons into the cargo and simply lift it up into their own tree. Mighty One tells Terr that they live on the other side of the park, and cautions him that they are evil. When the now-literate Oms read the new sign on one of the walls, they realize the park is about to be "de-Omised." Terr decides that he must take this information to the tribe of bandits, and is quickly captured and taken before their leader, a wizened old woman. The woman is skeptical of his claims and orders Terr\'s imprisonment. When the de-Omising begins, however, the old woman returns and frees him. The de-Omising is accomplished using disks that release a poison gas. A great many Oms perish from this gas, but a sizable number still manage to escape through a crack in the park wall. Two passing Draags witness the exodus, and one begins crushing the Oms underfoot. The Oms retaliate and manage to kill their attacker while the other escapes. Afterward, Mighty one is revealed to be killed and the old woman leads the survivors to a place where she believes they will be safe. The death of a Draag puts the Council in an uproar. De-Omising is stepped up to a much higher priority, new technologies are developed, and extermination frequency is scheduled to greatly increase. The old woman has led the two now-united tribes to an old rocket depot. Applying their newfound knowledge, the Oms, under Terr\'s direction, very quickly adapt the abandoned technologies to their own purposes and begin to flourish, thanks to the rebirth of mechanized industry. On a visit to the old woman, Terr\'s wife hears her express both optimism and regret that she will not live to see the Oms finally find peace. Fatalities resulting from Draag attempts to de-Om the rocket depot are minimized by the creation and organized use of shelters, but the Draags\' updated de-Omising technologies become ever more aggressive, and when an automated scout detects the persistent Om settlement, it summons an array of lethal devices. As the attacks become more diverse and effective, the Oms launch their manned rockets toward the Fantastic Planet, where they discover headless humanoid statues. As Draag meditation bubbles descend to alight atop the statues, the statues begin to dance. It is revealed via Terr\'s voiceover that this is the secret of the Fantastic Planet. Draag meditation animates the statues and allows the Draag to reproduce. When the feet of the dancing statues threaten the rockets, the Oms use energy weapons to shatter the statues, effectively killing thousands of meditative Draag. Pandemonium reigns in the Council chamber, for it seems the two species will destroy one another if they cannot find a way to live together. Apparently they do just that, for in the very next scene, an Om steps down off an outstretched Draag hand, removes his silly hat and assumes a posture of confidence and self-assertion. The headset voice dispassionately recounts the Om\'s construction of a new satellite where Oms can live, "which they call Terr, after their ancestral planet."'] ['Once upon a time on the African continent, there was a village called Nidiobina that was ravaged by flames.

Wang Laboratories, a major employer in Lowell in the more prosperous 1980s, declared bankruptcy and virtually went out of business in the early 1990s. The Lowell of 1995 had a large percentage of the population unemployed or underemployed, in poverty, and unaffected by positive things in the city like the Lowell National Historical Park and The Lowell Folk Festival . Much of the film takes place in a lower-class section of the city\'s  Highlands neighborhood. The documentary frames the lives of three addicts against this background; particularly their hopeless situations, while exploring them as human beings. The film reveals the lives behind addiction: their aspirations, why they do drugs and why they don\'t quit, etc. It interviews their families, friends, and members of the community, discussing how drugs have destroyed the lives of the addicts. Richard Farrell, one of the directors, writers, and producers, is a native Lowellian and a former addict; allowing the crew deep access to the city\'s drug scene. The filmmakers follow around three people: Boo Boo, Brenda, and former professional boxer Dicky Eklund in their daily exploits to get high. Throughout the course of the documentary, Brenda, a prostitute, becomes pregnant and contemplates an abortion but has to "hook" to pay for the abortion. Whenever she earns enough money she blows it on drugs instead of getting the $395 abortion. The father could be her on-again off-again boyfriend Mike  or the father may, in fact, be Boo Boo. Brenda also attempts detox rehab for the baby, but after talking to her parents decides to abort, then do detox, then to go back home. She loses the will to complete the program, as she had 6 times before. She ultimately goes missing which launches Boo-Boo into a panic as he looks for her. The police become aware of her whereabouts, but are unable to tell Boo-Boo per her wishes. Dicky, the older brother of "Irish" Micky Ward, is a boxer who had at one time fought Sugar Ray Leonard, losing by decision after 10 rounds and attempted to make a comeback. He tries to prevent his habit - and the crimes he commits to feed it - from destroying his life, but he can never stay clean for long and ends up arrested on multiple violent charges. While awaiting trial, his mother attempts to raise bail money with a benefit at the local VFW. The event develops into a fight between spectators and the $5,000 bail is not raised. Later, Boo-Boo discovers he has HIV after Brenda had been missing for several months. He subsequently attempts to find honest work, joins a support group, and attempts to re-open contact with his family. He loses a job as a deliveryman at a donut shop when it is revealed he was driving with no license. The documentary ends with him discussing how he is the only member of the three still in Lowell and not in jail. In the closing credits, it is revealed that 6 months after filming, Boo Boo is still in Lowell with a $200 a day crack habit, Dicky was sentenced to 10-15 years in prison , and Brenda died of a drug overdose on October 25 1995.'] ['Betty, Bimbo and Koko are the owners of a travelling medicine show.

Minnie attracts Mickey by intentionally dropping her handkerchief so Mickey will return it to her. They attend a vaudeville show where they first see a slideshow presentation called "Father, Dear, Father", which features the song "Come Home, Father" by Henry Clay Work. In the show, a little girl attempts to get her father to leave a local tavern because he hadn\'t come right home from work as promised and got drunk at the tavern. In the fourth picture in the slideshow, we see the clock tower, which reads 1:00 am.

During his exercise, he bends over too far to cause the stitching in his bottom to accidentally rip. After repairing his torn bottom, he feels a rumbly in his tumbly, so visits his pantry, but only to find that his jar of honey is empty . As he starts wondering where he can get more honey, he hears a bee fly by and decides to try to get honey from the beehive in a hollow of a nearby honey tree. He climbs the tree and reaches as high as he can, but the branch he is standing on breaks, and he falls into a gorse bush. Not wanting to give up, Pooh decides to go to Christopher Robin\'s house, where he greets Christopher Robin, Eeyore, Owl, Kanga and Roo. Pooh borrows a blue balloon from Christopher Robin to try to get the honey from the honey tree. He rolls himself in a black mud puddle to disguise himself as a little black rain cloud, and then uses the balloon to float up next to the tree hollow that houses the beehive. He tucks his hand into the hollow to get some honey to taste, also gulping some bees along with the honey, thus prompting him to spit out the bees. As the disguise begins to wear off, Pooh kicks one of the bees with his muddy foot, causing it to fall into the same mud puddle that Pooh has previously rolled in, but then the bee gets even with Pooh, and as the last of the disguise reveals Pooh to the bees, the one he kicked stings his bottom, causing him to swing forward and back again until his bottom is wedged into the hollow of the honey tree. As the bees laugh, Pooh concludes that he is dealing with the wrong kinds of bees as the tree begins to shake violently. The bees then eject him from the tree like a cork out of a bottle, causing the balloon to break from its string. Pooh holds onto the now untied balloon--from which the air is running out--for dear life as he flies through the air, chasing the bees in the process. When the balloon runs out of air, Pooh falls and is caught by Christopher Robin. The chase is now reversed; the angry bees go after Pooh and Christopher Robin, but they manage to hide from them in the mud puddle. With honey still on his mind, Pooh Bear goes to Rabbit\'s house, hoping to find some honey there. Rabbit politely invites Pooh for lunch, despite being aware of Pooh\'s vast appetite. Pooh then proceeds to eat every last bit of honey available in Rabbit\'s house, thanks Rabbit and waddles off to leave. He climbs through Rabbit\'s front door, which is a hole, but because he has become so fat and full of honey, he gets stuck in the hole and unable to make it through. Rabbit tells Pooh that it all comes from eating too much, and Pooh, in response, tells Rabbit that it all comes from not having front doors big enough. Rabbit tries to free Pooh by pushing on his over-sized bottom, but the bear won\'t budge. In a panic, Rabbit runs off to fetch Christopher Robin for help. While Pooh waits, he is visited by Owl and Gopher. Owl tries to cheer Pooh up, but ends up making Pooh feel embarrassed by his tight predicament. Gopher offers to free Pooh using dynamite, but Pooh rejects the offer. Rabbit then comes back with Christopher Robin. The two try to pull Pooh Bear out, but he won\'t budge an inch. Christopher Robin then suggests pushing him back in, but Rabbit protests, shoving a chair up against Pooh\'s bottom to prevent him from going back into Rabbit\'s house. Eventually, Christopher Robin decides that Pooh will just have to wait to get thin again. Rabbit is forced to make the best of a bad situation and tries various methods of disguising the bear\'s bottom, including painting a moose face on it and using his legs to hold up a shelf. Kanga and Roo stop by and give him a bouquet of honeysuckle flowers, which causes him to sneeze, thus sending the shelf  flying. Rabbit then reduces to using Pooh\'s bottom as a chair, with his legs as arm rests and the main bulk as a cushion. One night, Gopher returns to see Pooh, carrying his lunchbox with him. Pooh wonders what\'s inside the lunchbox. When he learns that Gopher has a pot of honey, Pooh asks him for a little taste of it, but Rabbit, who has overheard their conversation, runs out, and reminds Pooh that he can\'t eat anything until he is thin again as he confiscates the honey pot. As Gopher accuses Rabbit for confiscating the honey, Rabbit runs back out with a sign reading "Don\'t Feed The Bear", which he hammers onto the ground. Many days later, Rabbit leans on Pooh\'s bottom and discovers that Pooh has budged ever so slightly, sending him dashing off to find Christopher Robin. Christopher Robin, Kanga, Eeyore, Owl, Roo and Gopher start pulling on Pooh from outside the house while Rabbit frantically pushes Pooh from inside, but the bear still won\'t move. Fed up with all the delay, Rabbit takes several steps backwards and charges into Pooh. With a loud "pop!" he is ejected out of Rabbit\'s front door like a bullet from a gun, knocking everyone else down as a result, as he goes flying through the air. He crashes headfirst in the hollow of the honey tree, getting himself stuck again and frightening the bees away. The gang runs after him, and Christopher Robin tells Pooh that they will help him get out again, but Pooh tells them to take their time; he is quite content to remain stuck as he is with his bottom outside and his top inside, happily eating the honey.'] ["Where does artificial fruit flavoring come from?

Backed by a cardboard cityscape, Larry declares that the world needs a hero, a hero, a superhero, and then gets stuck to the wall by his plunger ears while he shows off. When Bob the Tomato enters and asks about the superhero costume, Larry explains that he doesn\'t feel special, that "plain old Larry" is "plain old boring". This of course dovetails with the viewer\'s letter, Myra Egleston of Youngstown, Pennsylvania, about self-esteem, and Bob starts the story. The story begins in the desert near Jerusalem, Israel where David  and his brothers  are tending a flock of sheep. These sheep tend to tip over a lot which keeps the shepherds busy. Worse, Dave\'s brothers are constantly picking on him by purposely tipping over their sheep and forcing Dave to pick them up, or making him get them food while he is working. Their father Jesse  comes with the news that the Philistines are attacking, and that King Saul  is gathering an army to face the threat. All the brothers run to volunteer, but Dave is stopped by Jesse who tells him that "big people do big things and little people do little things," so Dave must stay and tend the sheep. At King Saul\'s camp, the Israelites and the Philistines  make a deal to end the war quickly. They agree to have their champions, their two greatest fighters, face off. The tribe whose champion is victorious shall win the war, and the losing tribe will become their slaves. Seeing as how the Philistines aren\'t especially big, King Saul agrees. However, he faints in fright when his opponents bring out their champion: the massive and towering Goliath, the Giant Pickle. The story breaks here for Silly Songs with Larry. The number is "I Love My Lips", in which Larry, lying on a psychiatrist\'s couch, confesses his love for his lips and his fear of losing them. As the psychiatrist  tries to understand Larry\'s fear, Larry becomes increasingly focused on lips, to the point where everything the cucumber sees during a Rorshach test is a lip. The story then resumes. Naturally, no one is willing to fight Goliath and proceed to stall him for forty days by running and hiding. Eventually, Dave is sent to the camp to deliver some food to his brothers, and he is ashamed at the sight of his brothers and the rest of the Israelites cowering in fear. Dave then goes to King Saul and tells him that he will fight Goliath. King Saul is skeptical but reluctantly grants his permission, though he does attempt to make Dave over with his royal armor and sword. However, they are much too big, and Dave resolves to go into battle just as he is. Dave goes into battle armed only with stones, a sling, and his faith in God, while Goliath dons boxing gloves. The battle is short: Dave slings a stone at Goliath and hits him between the eyes, sending the Giant Pickle falling to the ground in defeat. Realizing their loss, the Philistines panic and run away, while the Israelites congratulate Dave for his victory and his faith. Back on the countertop, Bob explains that through God, all things are possible. This means that little people can do big things and that Larry doesn\'t need to dress up as a superhero to be special. Regardless, Larry still wants to be Larry-Boy, which is okay with Bob so long as Larry is just as comfortable with being himself. As Larry resumes his Larry-Boy act, he gets himself stuck on the camera as the credits roll.'] ['The film is set in an unspecified time on Earth when the descendants of a genetically enhanced race created by mankind have control of the planet.

Baron Crecilius Pryme, a charismatic political from Ume City, sets out to convince his fellow ghen that what remains of the human race must be eradicated because he believes they are forming a crusade to attack the ghen.

Fortunately for Po, it doesn\'t take him long to bring the class to order and for the kids to calm down, and begins to emphasize to the kids that combat is not the only part of what Kung Fu is about, while its true meaning is "excellence of self." To illustrate his point, he uses the stories of the Furious Five\'s individual pasts and the basic philosophical concepts they learned that enabled them to be great Kung Fu masters.  In his youth, Mantis was a petulantly impatient warrior who was prone to jumping to conclusions and making impulsive decisions. When this habit got himself captured by crocodile bandits, the long wait he was forced to endure in his cage allowed him to find the patience to play dead long enough to ambush his captors.  Viper, the daughter of Great Master Viper, was born without venomous fangs. Her father, who relied on his venomous bite to protect the village, was despondent that she could never succeed him as a warrior, making her feel timid. One day during a festival, Great Master Viper encountered a gorilla bandit who wore armor hard enough to shatter his fangs when he tried to bite him. Seeing her father in peril, Viper found the courage to fight the bandit and defeat him with her ribbon dancing skills.  Crane was an unconfident janitor of a Kung Fu academy until the star pupil Mei Ling encouraged him to seek enrollment in the school. Even though his nerve failed him at the tryouts, Crane accidentally stumbled into the intimidating challenge that determined eligibility and suddenly found the confidence to take the challenge, with his skinny body proving to be an asset that enabled him to succeed.  Tigress was an orphan whose status as an apex predator and her destructive lack of control of her strength left her feared and isolated in the rest of the orphanage where she lived. Master Shifu came to kindly teach her the discipline she desperately needed to control her movements until she could perform delicate tasks with ease enough to allay the concerns of the orphanage and the kids that lived there. When she was again rejected for adoption by the adults who were still scared of her, Master Shifu took her in as his student and foster daughter.  Monkey was a troublemaker who tormented his village owing to him being publicly humiliated in his youth. He defied all attempts to force him to leave until Master Oogway confronted him and defeated him in a fight, deducing the cause of his anti-social behavior. Rather than making him leave the village as per the challenge, Oogway told him to stay and encouraged him to show compassion to others, as he would want in similar circumstances.  At the end, Master Shifu returns to see Po\'s anticipated lack of progress teaching and he\'s surprised that he underestimated Po\'s talents yet again, considering how much the panda\'s students have learned. But when the bunnies ask Po how his first day of Kung Fu was, all the unpleasant memories during the original film flash through his head; he then proudly says, "It was totally awesome!"'] ['A young monk lives a simple life in a temple on top of a hill.

Just when the two finally reach the end of the mist, they come across Tigger. Pooh tells Tigger that Rabbit is still in the forest and Tigger heads back to find him. Rabbit is lost and ends up in a dark, damp and misty part of the forest, where he\'s scared by various animal noises, including frogs croaking and a caterpillar munching loudly on leaves.

Tigger tries to teach Roo how to ice skate by doing it himself, but unfortunately, he loses his balance and collides with Rabbit while trying to regain it. In moments Tigger slides into a snowbank and Rabbit crashes into his house. Tigger then decides that he does not like ice skating. Later on, while bouncing around the woods with Roo on his back, Tigger accidentally jumps to the top of a very tall tree and is too scared to dare climb down. He gets even more scared when Roo uses Tigger\'s tail as a swing, making Tigger think he\'s "rocking the forest". Meanwhile, Pooh and Piglet are investigating strange animal tracks that are really Tigger and Roo\'s. Suddenly, they hear Tigger howling, for help and quickly hide. At first, Pooh mistakes Tigger\'s howl for the sound of a "Jagular"; but after seeing that it is only Tigger and Roo in the tree, he and Piglet come to the rescue. Shortly afterward, Christopher Robin, Rabbit, and Kanga arrive and the gang uses Christopher\'s coat as a net for Tigger and Roo to land in once they jump from the tree. Roo successfully jumps down but Tigger, who is still too frightened to move, makes up one excuse after another to not come down. Rabbit then decides that the group will just have to leave Tigger in the tree forever, on which Tigger promises never to bounce again if he ever is released from his predicament. At that moment, the narrator chimes in for help. Tigger begs him to "narrate" him down from the tree, and he tilts the book sideways, allowing Tigger to step onto the text of the page. Tigger starts to feel better that he made it this far but before he can do otherwise, the narrator tilts the book back the other way, causing Tigger to fall down into the snow.

Later Donald Duck appears rolling a vendor cart through the audience selling lemonade, popcorn, and ice cream. Donald\'s voice disturbs Mickey as he can be heard over the music. Donald then pulls out a small flute and hops up on stage uninvited. As the band is still playing the "Finale" segment, Donald begins playing "Turkey in the Straw" at the same tempo as the band. The entire band, seemingly unaware of themselves, begin to play Donald\'s song instead of the prepared music. Mickey angrily breaks Donald\'s flute, but he only produces another from his clothing. This continues for a while until it is discovered that Donald is carrying dozens of hidden flutes, some of which he seems to pull from thin air. After Donald has been kicked off stage, a bee comes along and harasses him. Donald fights the bee off and it goes on to bother the already agitated Mickey. Mickey\'s swatting of the bee is taken as a cue from the orchestra. Donald later throws ice cream at the bee which catches Mickey in the crossfire. As Mickey plays Ranz des Vaches Horace Horsecollar tries to kill the bee with a hammer but hits Goofy on the head and Goofy is seen headless. Finally as Horace takes off his coat the band comes to the "Storm" segment of the overture which summons an actual tornado, prompting the audience and Donald to run for their lives. The tornado sucks up everything in its path, even the pavilion on which the band is playing. But the band is so used to distractions by this point that they continue to play from inside the twister. As the storm passes the band  is thrown into a tree and the overture comes to its natural conclusion. Yet by this time the only remaining audience member is Donald Duck who applauds enthusiastically. He then produces one last flute and plays "Turkey in the Straw" again, but the band members throw their instruments at him.'] ['Destination Earth begins with the emperor Ogg  sending a bumbling subordinate Martian on a mission to Earth to find a better power source for his royal limousine.

Snoopy decides to take out one book, a book on magic, which after reading, influences him to hold a Vaudeville show . During the opening, Snoopy practices magic with Woodstock by his side. Charlie Brown warned Snoopy to that the cat next door will get upset if he and Woodstock get really loud. However, Snoopy and Woodstock continue to perform more magic tricks and the cat next door angrily rips Snoopy\'s doghouse apart. He recruits Marcie as one assistant and announcer, and Sally as his silent assistant. In the show, he pulls a rabbit out of his hat (actually [[Woodstock , then does a ring trick that\'s goes a bit wrong. Both of these tricks raise the ire of one heckler who demands their money back and doesn\'t see the humor the others see, but Snoopy quickly shuts him up both times. He also does the "stick-in-the-hole" trick to Franklin , the "amputation-decapitation" trick to Peppermint Patty, cutting Linus\'s trademark security blanket into strips , the "levitation" trick to Lucy van Pelt, and biggest of all, making Charlie Brown literally disappear. Unfortunately, a sudden rainstorm ends the show early, and Charlie Brown is left invisible. Convinced he is going to remain that way for the rest of his life, he prepares to "roam the world as a lost soul", and Sally begins moving her stuff into his room. Before Charlie starts roaming, he decides to feed Snoopy to show him what has happened. When Snoopy realizes he cannot yet reverse the trick, he tries a couple of different ideas to make Charlie Brown somewhat visible again, including draping a sheet over his head, which scares Sally, and causes Charlie Brown to faint when he sees himself in the mirror. Despite this shortcoming, Charlie Brown realizes he has a golden opportunity to kick Lucy\'s infamous football without her usual prank of pulling it away at the last second. Taking advantage of his invisibility, Charlie Brown finally kicks the ball out of a bewildered Lucy\'s hand and then taunts her about it. Furious that Charlie Brown seems to have gotten the upper-hand, Lucy demands that Snoopy find a way to turn him back, threatening to \'clobber him.\' Snoopy studies the book, and after testing a number of counterspells on Woodstock , he goes about casting his counterspell in all directions, unsure just where Charlie Brown is. As Snoopy wanders into a vicinity where Lucy is setting up another place-kick, Charlie Brown happens to run by where Snoopy is practicing. Just as he is about to kick the ball again, Snoopy casts the counterspell in Charlie Brown\'s direction, causing him to unknowingly become visible again. Lucy witnesses his reappearance and pulls the ball away for the 11th time as Charlie Brown winds up to kick it. He then lands on his back. Nevertheless, Charlie Brown is happy that he finally kicked the ball, though Lucy considers this a false statement, saying no one will believe him. When Lucy scoffs at Snoopy\'s magic abilities, the insulted beagle magically levitates Lucy into the sky like he levitated her during that magic show earlier, and leaves her stuck there as payback. Snoopy and Charlie Brown happily laugh and dance away to conclude a satisfying day, while Linus eventually pulls Lucy down with his blanket during the closing credits.'] ["Froggy has a crush on a young girl named Marilyn, who is too preoccupied with her budding career as a dancer to pay Froggy attention.

The conductor opens the doors to the train at left, and out steps an obviously drunk man carried between two women in fancy dress. The cop begins to mix it up with the three of them, and they are interrupted by another man in a bowler hat; he is carrying a large package and steps onto the train to the right after greeting the two women and the drunk man. One of the women steps forward into the frame and lifts up her skirt so that the drunk man can tie her shoe. This gets the attention of the cop, who hustles the three of them onto the train; meanwhile what appears to be a pair of bare legs stick out from a window of a train car and are quickly withdrawn. The cop just manages to notice this, and calls all parties back out to the platform where it is revealed that the man in the bowler hat has a pair of department store mannequin's legs with him."] ['About a Girl opens with a striking shot of a silhouette &mdash; against a skyline of clouds above a field &mdash; of a girl singing the Britney Spears song "Stronger" and doing the dance routine. It cuts abruptly to a close-up of the girl talking in a strong Mancunian accent to the camera: "If Jesus were alive today &mdash; right, he\'d probably be a singer." She is walking against a backdrop of Manchester\'s industrial landscape, talking non-stop, mixing wry statements about stardom and singers with random quotes from her parents and descriptions of her life: her relationship with her dad, her frustrations with her mum, her desire to become a famous singer, the band she has formed with her friends. Things any 13-year-old might talk about. Her monologue is interrupted and intercut with different scenes of her with her family and her dad; her in a perfume department, sitting on a bench singing "Stronger" again, and on the back of a bus with her girlfriends singing "Oops!... I Did It Again" by Britney Spears and doing the routine. As she goes on walking alongside a canal, the girl\'s stories become more and more underlain by an uncomfortable feeling that the gravity of her experiences does not match her flippant retelling of her everyday life: her descriptions of her pop idols and her favourite ice cream are mixed with hints about family troubles, poverty and domestic violence. The \'underside\' to her light-hearted storytelling is revealed in a shocking scene when, stating that she has become "good at hiding things", she throws the plastic bag she has been carrying into the canal. A camera shot from under the water reveals a baby surrounded by blood.'] ['A man casually sets up for a fishing trip at the waters edge.

He observes that Kev is "a bit of a wuss" after he fails to replicate the proper shotgunning technique and calls for Kev to come sit close to him for a test of courage, the knife game, which involves stabbing a knife between outstretched fingers at an ever-faster rate. The game is usually played with one person\'s hand at a time and as a gesture of what may be seen as self-sacrifice, Mick puts his hand over Kev\'s in order to shield Kev\'s hand from the brunt of an injury should it occur. When a train speeds by them, Mick accidentally cuts Kev and himself very slightly with the knife. They clasp each other\'s hands tightly and Mick, who suddenly seems very insecure and in need of affection is lovingly embraced by Kev, who perhaps has known all along why Mick brought him here. A single screen of credits appears, then the film ends with a brief shot of the two in silhouette, standing apart, watching the sun set over the ocean.'] ['The plot revolves around Dr. Moras  who visits a barber , who accidentally shaves Moras to look like a Chinese person , and then mistakenly cuts off Moras\' rival\'s head , which is sewn back on by the barber\'s assistant , and ends with a sword fight - "The Duel" - and in which Faber is triumphant  and Ebinger and Faber embrace in a happy ending in a mysterious Senegalese Salon .

David is in handcuffs, and he has blood on his face and shirt. He is smoking a cigarette. He tells the officer that after he finished his work as an orderly at the hospital, he was knocked unconscious and taken to a large room. Inside the room, David was strapped to a chair with a large, rusty metal device locked onto his head. To his left was a small television, which began playing a video showing a frightening puppet that tells him that the device on his head is a "reverse beartrap", which is hooked into his jaws and will pry his face open with great force if he does not unlock it in time. The puppet tells David that the only key to unlock the device is in the stomach of his dead cellmate . David is able to break free of his bonds, but by doing so he sets off a timer on the back of the device. Across the room, he finds the body that the puppet mentioned, but also finds that the man is actually alive but under paralysis.

Moe and Larry share the food, and Curly gets the bone and the eggshell. While eating, Curly breaks his tooth while attempting to eat the hambone, resulting in a major toothache. Moe suggests he simply get some sleep, and in the morning the toothache will be gone. The boys situate themselves for bed in a conveniently placed three-tiered bunk bed. Curly naturally receives the top bunk and his ascent thereto is not without mishap. During the night, Moe unsuccessfully tries to alleviate Curly's pain but is unable to do so. While Curly does finally fall asleep, we are introduced into his dreams where he is still whining on about his current state of affairs. His persistent moaning and complaining about his toothache finally aggravate the other two into action. His fear of dentists leaves the Stooges with precious few options, leaving them to improvise their own brand of home dentistry techniques. These techniques include trying to extract the tooth with a fishing pole and line, tying the tooth to the doorknob and violently closing it, tying the tooth to a ceiling light fixture and jumping from a ladder, and lastly, firecrackers.  At their wits' end, Curly is taken off by Moe to the dentist, Dr. Tug , who admits to being a butcher as an earlier profession. He then calls Curly and Moe in the room where patients get checked up, but a belligerent Curly makes the check-up difficult. Dr. Tug is exhausted from wrestling with Curly, so he asks his partner Dr. Yank  to complete the extraction. However, Moe tries to placate Curly's fears about dentistry by laying in the chair and simulating the procedure just as Yank, unaware who the actual patient is, enters the office and knocks Moe out cold with ether in a rag and pulls HIS tooth instead despite Curly's protests. Yank hands the extracted tooth to Curly and, upon learning that Curly is the real patient, runs out of the room. Moe awakens and finds Curly holding the tooth. This understandably angers him to no end and he takes it out on Curly, who attempts to defend himself. This flailing action in the dream translates to similar action in his sleep, causing him to fall through the entire bunk bed, causing it to collapse in a heap, on top of his two sleeping compatriots. This, in classic Moe fashion, angers him once again and he gives Curly a solid slug to the jaw. This dislodges the problem tooth and all is well. The boys fall asleep where they lie amongst the bed cushions and splintered wood."] ['Porky Pig purchases a new home from a real estate agent, which turns out to be a dilapidated old house.

After a failed attempt at disposing of her with a trapdoor, Mr. Sutten gives her three animals, Mark the Polar Bear , Paul the Alligator , and Warren the Ostrich , and makes a deal - If she can take them home and prove they are able to conventionally live in a house like the average human, he will shut down the zoo and release them all. Helen takes the animals back to her apartment for the night and leaves them with a manual on how to live there, telling them she\'ll check up on them again in the morning. The animals first find her washing machine and dryer, which Mark goes into assuming it\'s where he is supposed to bathe when the others question what it\'s for. When he comes out, he feels dizzy from the spinning and bumps into a shelf, knocking a bottle of floor wax onto the ground, causing the slippery wax to then spill across the floor and prevent them from being able to get up. Somebody then appears at the door, and upon trying to get over and answer it the three animals find they slip over every time. Mark tries to resolve the problem by kicking Paul and Warren across the room, but this causes disaster when they crash straight through the door and knock the man down the stairs. At the bottom the man tells them he had come to offer them spiritual enlightenment, which Paul declines, claiming he heard it\'s "high in sodium". Later, Mark takes some ice from the fridge and puts it on his bed in an attempt to make it feel more like his bed at home. During the night, however, all the ice below him melts and floods the apartment, as well as waking up the others. The water then reacts with an electrical outlet, causing a fire. In attempt to stop the fire, Paul checks Helen\'s manual, which tells them in the case of a fire the apartment\'s sprinkler system will start automatically. The sprinkler then turns on, which resolves the fire but contributes to the flood. Now desperately trying to work out how to prevent the flood from getting even worse, Paul reads aloud that the sprinkler system will turn off manually, but he misunderstands the meaning of the word, asking "Where are we supposed to find a man at this hour?" Warren suggests that if they wait, the sprinkler system may just turn off by itself... The next morning Helen arrives back at the apartment, seeing water flowing out from underneath the door as she arrives. When she opens it, much to her dismay a huge gush comes out and washes her away, after which she finds her apartment in a huge mess. Helen asks the animals "What on Earth happened?" with Paul responding "We had a little accident", although Warren attempts to lighten the situation by reassuring her that they "kept the place intact". This is soon proved wrong when Mark leans against the wall, his hand going straight through it and consequently causing the entire building to collapse. The cartoon ends with a disappointed Helen breaking the fourth wall, saying "This is going to be tougher than I thought".'] ['Chaplin plays a handyman at a hotel.

One Halloween night, Witch Hazel observes Huey, Duey, and Louie going trick-or-treating. The trio, dressed as a ghost, a devil, and a wizard, go up to the door of their uncle Donald Duck\'s house under a covered porch and ring the bell. But instead of giving them the traditional candy, Donald deliberately puts firecrackers in their bags, then pulls a string leading to a rigged bucket of water hanging under the porch roof and tips it on the boys, causing the boys to get soaked and wet. Donald laughs, says "So long, Boys!", and the discouraged nephews go and sit on the curb. But Hazel, who was secretly watching the drama unfold, tries to comfort the boys. When she discovers that they believe in "real witches," she decides to help them get their treats from Donald after all. At first Hazel tries to convince Donald herself, but he deliberately pulls her nose, stretching it, then lets it go, and dumps another bucket of water on her, making her also look soaked and wet. Realizing that the job may be harder than she thought, she tells the boys that they will use to her magic for this situation. At another location, the nephews watch Hazel concoct a magic potion in a large cauldron. In a scene paying homage to Shakespeare\'s MacBeth , Hazel adds ingredients somewhat toned down from the play.  Hazel fills a spray bottle of the potion and returns to Donald\'s house with the nephews. Hazel sprays a Jack-o\'-lantern and three fence posts with the potion and they become an animated chorus of ghosts singing the theme song. A terrified Donald instantly agrees to treat the boys, but when Hazel refers to him as a pushover, he realizes he\'s being tricked and puts everything back. Donald locks his pantry and swallows the key. Hazel then uses the potion on Donald\'s feet, and commands them to "kick out that key." But when the key is kicked out, Donald throws it under the pantry door. Hazel then becomes mad and orders Donald\'s feet to "smash that door down" with Donald. After several attempts, Hazel tells Donald to "take a longer start, ABOUT A MILE OR TWO!" and Donald literally runs far before charging at lightning speed and crashes, finally breaking down the pantry door and is left unconscious on the floor.

His entrance is interrupted by a black cat named Butch, who slams the door into Tom causing him to look like a figure in Egyptian hieroglyphics. Jerry then comes out from the locker room, but Tom orders him to pick up his tennis equipment. Jerry hands Tom his racquet and a tennis ball, and a match between Tom and Butch begins. With no further need for the mouse, Tom dismisses Jerry by hitting him into the locker room wall and he ends up landing in the drinking fountain. Jerry's mad while standing in the fountain. Tom serves the ball and Butch returns it with such speed that it causes Tom's racket to burst into flame when it grazes the handle. Tom grabs another racket and serves three balls to Butch. Butch then splits his racket into three and returns all three balls back into Tom's mouth, and they settle into his tail.  Tom's next serve resembles a badminton serve and he pulls the net to force a drop shot. Butch then hits the ball hard into the ground and Tom has to stretch his arm all the way to the end of the court to make the return. Butch is then shown making many returns at the net, but the ball is actually bouncing off Tom's face. The ball eventually bounces back toward the end of Butch's court and Butch hits it with a lot of backspin, causing it to buzz in the air. Tom tries to chase after the ball, but ends up running into the post of the net and wrapping himself in the net. Jerry now gets in the fun by playing the cats against each other. He hands Tom a small white bomb which looks like a tennis ball so as to blow up Butch. Jerry winks at Tom and Tom winks back. Tom lights the bomb and serves it to Butch. Butch is about to return the bomb but it explodes just before he makes contact with it, making him look like a blackfaced ballet dancer. Jerry then removes a round, white piece of a gate that resembles a tennis ball. It is heavy enough to cause Butch to be pulled into the ground when he grabs it. Jerry winks at Butch, who winks back and swings the racket, allowing the force of the net to serve the heavy ball to Tom. The overconfident Tom gets hit in the head and breaks into pieces. Jerry starts to laugh at this and then he ducks out of the way as Tom is trying to hit him with tennis balls. Jerry ends up swallowing one of the tennis balls and he gets used as a rodent tennis ball between the two cats. After a small rally, Jerry lands up walking on the net like a tightrope and then wobbles onto Butch's head. Tom swings, hitting Butch instead and then throwing him onto the ground behind Tom. Butch is about to hit Tom but he sees Jerry running away on the other side of the court and he hits a tennis ball toward Jerry. Jerry grabs a tennis racquet and starts rallying with Butch. Tom gets involved in the rally when a ball gets stuck in his mouth, which Butch simply hits out of it. Butch runs through a chain link fence to return the next shot by Jerry, and Jerry has to move the sideline after a ball hits the net and drops over. Tom tries to get involved again, but Butch stops him. The rally continues and Butch runs back and forth on his side of the court with Tom next to him. Jerry then hits a really high ball and both cats run toward each other with an attempt to hit the ball, but they crash into each other and become a pair of conjoined cats. They separate and realize that they need to work together. They run toward Jerry and he runs toward an automatic tennis ball server, activating it at its highest speed. The huge force of the tennis balls hits the cats before they can dodge them, pushing them into the net, then through it all the way into a tree thousands of feet away, where they get tangled in the net, acting like marionettes. Jerry is then shown putting on a fancy jacket and he writes his name on a tennis trophy cup. He then stands and waves to a crowd of people and accepts his championship cup."] ["When your roommate dies from an allergic reaction to fruit and the rent is due and you don't have the cash to cover it, there's no time to mess around picking a new roommate.

He sees a red tram out his window and leaves his apartment to wait for the next tram to come by. As he sees the next tram approaching him, he puts his arms up to signal it to stop. At the same time, the wind begins to blow and a curtain from an open window in his apartment complex blows outward toward the sky. He boards the tram and for a while rides through the night continuously looking forward instead of out the windows at the scenery. Finally, in slow motion, he begins to move toward the curtain on the window of the tram and pulls it back. He sees strange objects as he passes through the night. All these objects are the only thing he can see when he passes them because they are engulfed in light, while the areas surrounding the objects is pitch black. As the tram continues on, it appears to disappear around him and he is back in a makeshift version of his apartment looking out the blinds of his window. He closes the blinds and seems to be startled by something. He follows it to the vent in his wall and looks into it. There appears to be nothing in the vent and he turns away disappointed. The wind begins to blow harder outside as another tram passes by his apartment complex. He then gets the idea to take off the screen of his vent and stick his hand into it. As he reaches trying to find anything in the vent the scenery of the movie changes again and he is back riding on the tram holding what looks like a crumbled piece of paper with a blood stain on it. After he sees the paper he passes out in the seat of the tram and awakens in the makeshift version of his apartment. He puts the crumbled, blood-stained paper on a hanger to dry and the movie begins to spin showing different unidentifiable objects. Finally, the movie stops spinning and shows the front of a church. The man is again inside of the red tram, that seems to be driving through the middle of the church, looking out of the window. The screen switches from pitch black to different arts on the inside of the church in the point of view like the audience themselves are riding the tram. Time passes and the man is at a loss of where he is. He looks around confused and again, finds himself in his apartment. It is obvious that time has passed because the lighting is much darker and the mood is much more sleepy. After this, the man is on the tram and the scenery switches between him on the tram and the objects from earlier in the movie. The man is riding along and the tram accelerates. The tram goes faster and faster and the man's head thrusts back as the wind blows against him. This results in him falling off of a chair that he apparently played like it was the tram. He falls backward off the chair and hits his head on the ground. He tries to get up, but fails. More time passes  and he is still motionless on the ground as the movie ends.{{cite web}}{{cite web}}"] ['Rosalia Derios is an unmarried woman in a small Sardinian village whose lover abandons her before the birth of their son, whom she names Anania.

Naturally, the Stooges, who are garbage men, are discovered and made the subjects of the wager. After many attempts to teach them proper etiquette , the Stooges will decide the wager by their behavior at a fancy society party. The party does not go well: Curly pulls Moe\'s jacket threads until it splits. Moe then hijacks Curly\'s oversized jacket. Larry and Moe dance with stomped feet and bumps galore. Curly, as usual, gets most of the faux pas: he shaves in front of a guest; he gets stuck on a spittoon; he picks a “maraschino” cherry from a punch bowl; he hides a bottle of champagne, which Moe sees. Frustrated, Moe butt-kicks Curly, resulting in the champagne popping open and spraying a guest. Eventually, Professor Richmond loses the bet and gives the $10,000 dollars to Professor Nichols. Nichols in turn makes a comment to a lady guest concerning being pestered by a bunch of “rowdies”. The remark does not go over well with her, and she slaps him in the face.

She points to the source of her irritation off-camera, and in a funny pan over to the sofa, there\'s an empty-faced Stan sitting with a cigar in his mouth. Mrs. H is having none of her husband\'s attempts at conciliation — "He leaves! Or I leave!" — and after just a moment of hesitation from Ollie, she makes good on her threat. "Uncle Bernal won\'t leave us a dime if you go," Ollie offers, but she shows how much she cares about that by sweeping two planters off their stands and onto the floor as she pounds out the door. And thus is set off the rest of the story. First Stan and Ollie have a round of vase smashing in the living room and Stan announces that he, too, will be leaving the premises. Then the doorbell rings — and of course it is Uncle Bernal. Some astonishingly fast sweeping conceals the evidence of the recent destructive contretemps, and Ollie greets Uncle B cordially. The two settle in on the sofa and Uncle Bernal says he wants to meet the little lady. Before Ollie can say she\'s not home, Stan slams a drawer upstairs and Ollie is forced to say, "I\'ll bring her down." Upstairs, Ollie drafts Stan into playing the absent Magnolia and supervises his wardrobe transformation, then hurries back down to ride herd on inquisitive Uncle B, who has discovered telltale debris of planters and vases behind the sofa. Ollie paves the way for his "wife\'s" grand entrance by telling his uncle that "She\'s not much to look at — But what a clown." Said entrance is indeed grand — when "she" turns her ankle and bounces down the steps with legs widely akimbo. Bernal looks stunned after his first glimpse of his niece, but he smiles wanly when Ollie looks for approval. Out on the sofa, Stan tries to snare the cigar Bernal is offering Ollie, then Uncle offers dinner — and dancing — at The Pink Pup, and "won\'t take no for an answer." At the supper club, Stan proves to be as inept a wife as he was a houseguest. When Ollie slips and pulls Stan down with him, "her" flailing attempts to get up are far removed from femininity; when her dumbbell-falsies tumble out, she has trouble staying in her chair. She does draw the gaze of a nearby drunk, though, whose attentions turn increasingly amorous and culminate when he presents her with a centerpiece and the question: "Didn\'t I meet you in the fountain at Miami?" He makes himself at home at their table, tickling Stan under the chin and rubbing Uncle Bernal more and more the wrong way, until Uncle asks Ollie, "Why don\'t you do something forceful?" Ollie\'s forceful action is to turn his bowl of soup over the drunk\'s head and leave the bowl on top like a doughboy\'s tin hat. The drunk maintains his dignity: he asks for his check, and for a bowl of soup "to take out." He exits with his tuxedo soiled, his soup-bowl full, but self-esteem flying high. When Ollie commandeers Stan\'s soup to replace his own, a cutaway to Uncle Bernal suggests that he might be growing a little tired of his would-be heir. Meanwhile, a dishonest waiter has been eyeing the chunky diamond pendant dangling from a posh lady diner, and when he gets the chance, he lifts it. But the maitre d\' pledges to the woman\'s husband he\'ll have everyone in the place searched, and the culprit chooses Stan\'s back to drop the hot rock down. Stan\'s resultant wriggling further irritates Bernal, so The Boys adjourn to the dance floor to sort things out. But they do not have much luck there, and get caught behind a screen, then in a phone booth, then up on stage with Ollie\'s hands all over Stan. Watching their gyrations is too much for exasperated Uncle Bernal who stands up and announces, "I\'m through! I\'ll leave my money to a dog and cat hospital!" The Boys pursue him out the front door, but he leaves them in front of the club. Ollie is crestfallen: "I\'ve lost my wife, an\' my fortune — What next?" From outside the frame comes an arm and a bowl of soup, which gets overturned onto Ollie\'s head, leaving the bowl on top. A cut to a wider shot reveals the little drunk from inside, still wearing his bowl like a WWI helmet, while the music track plays "Over There." In the closing two-shot, The Boys have slowly-spreading smiles, and we realize what they have not lost: the friendship that will carry them through nearly fifty more short subjects and many features.'] ["{{Plot}} Jerry is out in the cold Swiss Alps, caught up in a snowball and rolls all the way into a pillar.

While Tom falls from a duct, Jerry is a bit puzzled. Jerry surveys the large array of cheeses and walks in the air towards a large wheel of Emmentaler cheese. He starts to dive in and out of the holes in the cheese as Tom manages to open the door. Only his tail remains unfrozen, and Tom uses it to push himself and to light a fire to defrost. Jerry starts to eat the Emmentaler and yodels. Tom hears and sees Jerry through the holes and pumps out the mouse with a fireplace Bellows, but he falls back in before Tom can grab him. The cat tries this some more before he comes up with another plan. He hammers corks into all of the holes  and drops a giant weight on top of a giant bellows, which causes the cheese to burst and corks fly everywhere. Tom recovers from the storm to see much of the cheese gone and Jerry with a cheese-tutu. Jerry walks out, and seeing the tutu, does a brief dance. Tom claps as he approaches the mouse and then smacks Jerry between his paws, stunning the mouse and drops him outside in the snow. Tom goes back to sleep, but soon feels guilty. He imagines Jerry's spirit flying past him. Fearing Jerry is frozen solid, he rushes outside, and brings the frozen mouse inside. Wrapped in a warm blanket, Tom revives Jerry with a tablespoon of 360-proof Schnapps. Jerry wakes up and jumps into a pile of dolls and puts on a Swiss outfit. Tom plays a piano, while Jerry happily dances around."] ["Bagamoyo is a ferryboat that has provided a daily connection for the last 37 years between the city of Maputo and Catembe&nbsp;– a largely rural district of the Mozambican capital&nbsp;– carrying several hundred passengers and vehicles each day, as well as goods, from five in the morning until half past eleven at night, seven days a week.

The egg that she was nesting jumps up in her absence and falls to the ground, rolling into Jerry's mouse hole and into his bed. Jerry wakes up to find himself sitting on the egg. He is a little embarrassed at first, thinking he has laid an egg. Then begins to hatch making Jerry  bounce with it. Then out comes a baby woodpecker who instantly takes to Jerry as his mother. The adorable, but naturally, peckish woodpecker cannot resist pecking away at Jerry's furniture. Fortunately Jerry has a way to save his stuff. He finds a cracker and breaks off pieces for the woodpecker. Jerry gives a small piece to start but the woodpecker chops it fast. Jerry, a little startled, breaks a bigger piece and hold out to the little bird. The bird eats it and has almost shoulder-high of Jerry's arm in the birds mouth. He pulls his arm away. Jerry returns the woodpecker to his nest, but the little bird follows Jerry back to his hole. Eventually, Jerry gives up on the woodpecker and orders him out. With nowhere to go, the despondent baby woodpecker wanders around the garden, where he comes across an unsuspecting Tom, who is sitting in a deckchair, drinking and reading a magazine. The woodpecker carelessly pecks slightly at the deckchair's leg. An irritated Tom pours his drink onto the woodpecker, who then proceeds to peck through the entire leg of the deckchair, causing it to fold up with Tom still sitting on it, which causes him to swallow the glass he was holding in his hand. Mayhem ensues. Tom begins to chase the bird, who screeches for Mama. Jerry emerges from his mouse hole and decides to intervene, stopping Tom with a rake. However Tom manages to grab hold of the rake, trapping Jerry in the process, who cannot run away. The woodpecker pecks off the end of the rake, allowing Jerry to run off, and sending Tom hurtling backwards into a mailbox. Tom hurls the long remainder of the rake handle at Jerry and the bird, but the bird quickly pecks it down to a stub. In the ensuing chase, Tom swallows the bird. The bird pecks deep inside Tom's stomach, which vibrates violently. Tom drinks from a bucket of water hoping to drown the bird, only for the water to seep out through tiny holes in his body. Jerry knocked Tom's tail which makes him cringe and yelp in pain and the woodpecker eventually pecks his way out through Tom's teeth, and as Jerry runs off, he runs straight into an axe and is knocked out cold. As Tom attempts to disembowel Jerry, the woodpecker continually pecks at the cat's head. Tom grabs the woodpecker in his hand and corks his beak, rendering the woodpecker useless at attacking him. Tom then ties the woodpecker to a telegraph pole. However, the woodpecker manages to free himself, and noticing that Jerry has very little time to escape, quickly performs a complicated calculation in order to stop Tom and rescue Jerry. The woodpecker pecks away at the telegraph pole, which comes crashing down onto Tom's head, and then repeatedly pushes him down into the ground. The baby woodpecker finally locates his mother.Jerry is thankful for the woodpecker's help. However, the mother woodpecker flies into the scene. The baby woodpecker realizes just who his mother is after all, and is whisked away by his mother. Jerry realizes that he will miss his avian companion more than he thought he would. Just then, the baby woodpecker flies back to Jerry, gives him a big kiss and flies away again, as Jerry waves him off happily"] ["On the street, Oswald leads a handful of musicians whose devotedness towards him varies. Although the performance of the band showed some flaws, it mattered little to Oswald who simply carries on. Suddenly, the musicians decided to have a break inside the tavern, much to the rabbit's surprise. Oswald tries to follow them to the place, only to be pushed back out. Without a group to lead, the lonely Oswald wonders further on the street. He then notices a flock of birds on some powerlines, chirping and making various sounds. In no time the rabbit was elated, knowing he found something he could conduct as he starts swinging his hands. But the beautiful sight did not last long when a disturbed squirrel comes out of a post and pulls up a switch that electrocutes the birds. Somewhere within the area, a nurse tells an infant to stay put in the stroller just before leaving. The infant isn't accustomed to being left alone, even for a few minutes, and therefore starts bawling. Oswald came by and decides to cheer up the child. The rabbit then picks up a discarded water pipe and plays it like a wind instrument. Various objects came to life and went dancing to Oswald's music, but the infant was less impressed. The nurse returns to the scene after several minutes. The naive nurse thought Oswald is disturbing the child with the sound, and therefore pounds the rabbit in the noggin. While Oswald remains dazed on the pavement, the infant, however, was most delighted and starts to giggle."] ["In Kansas, Dorothy and Betsy are chased into the cornfield by the mule, Hank, and the farmhands draw their muskets at the beast.

Coyote  attempts several ways to get the Roadrunner . The Roadrunner reaches two outcroppings. When Wile E. tries it, the end of said outcropping comes off. Just when he thought he was going to suffer gravity yet again, Wile. E was saved by a tree branch. He tries to go on the plateau nearby, only for the plateau to fall to a river. A fish nearby is spooked when Wile E. gets his newest scheme. 1. The Coyote races after the Roadrunner with his new roller skates. When the Roadrunner tries to trip the Coyote, Wile E., in time, leaps in the air and sticks his tongue out at the Roadrunner. Little does he know, he is about to fall of a cliff yet again! He ends up in the ground, with only his feet sticking out, as the wheels fall off one of the skates. 2. After getting an explosive camera kit, Wile E. prepares for his newest deception. The Roadrunner is intrigued by the signs. When the Roadrunner got ready for his picture, the gun goes off on the Coyote. As the Roadrunner speeds away, Wile E. sees the one flaw of his attempt: he forgot to take off the lens cap that was on the entire time. 3. As the Roadrunner taunts the Coyote from above, Wile E. prepares a trampoline. However, when he jumps, he gets trapped inside like a burlap sack. 4. Now armed with a crossbow and dynamite, Wile E. prepares for his plan. However, when he lights the fuse and the Roadrunner comes, the crossbow fires yet the dynamite is left behind. 5. Now resorting to his best friend Acme, Wile E. receives a jet propelled pogo stick. However, when the Coyote prepares the pogo stick, it propels him to the cliff behind him. Down he goes again. 6. Using railroad deception again, Wile E. hammers a crossing sign, accompanied by Hi-Fi Railroad Crossing Sounds and tracks set up. When the Roadrunner stops, the Coyote tries to catch the bird, only to be run over by an actual train. 7. Having almost blowing his top with simple traps, Wile E. uses 12 bombs down an extremely long slide. He lifts the slide door to release the bombs from their bin, but none of them come out. He tries shaking the bin moderately, then violently. He douses the fuses to try to get them to go out, but when he tries to stomp on them, Boom! A dazed Wile E. slides down. The Roadrunner passes over him to add insult to injury. 8. Wile E. receives another of Acme's products, a jet propelled unicycle. When the Coyote lights the fuse, he is dragged away. Wile E. tries to balance himself and succeeds. When he passes the Roadrunner, he tries to get him, but didn't move when he seemed to speed off. Wile E. falls down off a cliff and the resulting cloud of smoke has the words The End on it."] ['Introduction: Wile E. is shown brandishing scissors on top of a high-rise tree branch, ready to cut the rope and drop a rock onto the passing Road Runner. The rock displays the title, and when it falls to the ground and barely misses, the credits are shown in the dust. Director Chuck Jones\' credit is displayed upon a rocket that the coyote plans to ride. The rocket is paused in mid-flight to show the coyote\'s Latin name: Hardheadipus Oedipus. The Road Runner is still leading the way, and his flight is paused to show his Latin name: Bat-outta-hell-ius. The chase goes well for Wile E., until the rocket slams into a low plateau. Luckily enough, the coyote still can continue the air chase. He almost catches the Road Runner, but slams his head on a rock arch before he can pounce. Wile E., looking like a sunflower, looks at the camera and then trudges off. 1. Hoping for better luck this time, Wile E. takes delivery of an ACME giant elastic rubber band and attempts to launch himself off a slingshot, but only succeeds in going about 2 feet before face planting. The coyote poses innocently on a rock perch until the Road Runner passes by below, and soon comes up with his next plan. 2. Again hoping for a big smash, he flips a clam-shaped rock across a thin outcropping, but when Wile E. finally pushes it over the edge, it flips over and the end attaches itself to the precipice. Wile E. attempts to push it down, and then stomps on and off it six times, with no result. Then, he jumps fully on and puts his whole might onto the rock, and succeeds. He continues to stomp on the rock until he realizes he\'s falling. He looks down and sees the ground, then attempts to jump off the rock. However, all that does is turn the rock in circles. Not giving up, Wile E. thus manages to slow the rock down, but the end result is the rock drilling through a large rock face and into a train tunnel, where the coyote is hit and thrown all the way back out. A small piece of the rock plants him on the ground neatly, and a relieved Wile E. steps off, but finds himself continuing to rotate periodically like the McKimson-created character Tasmanian Devil as he walks. 3. The camera shows an order form for an extremely large railroad construction job that Wile E. has done to attempt to ensnare his nemesis. Now, the camera zooms across the landscape to show the extremely long railroad, and that the coyote has put himself into a rocket sled to glide across the tracks. The first turn is going from almost straight down to about 60 degrees downwards; however, the sled breaks directly through the mounted railroad and face plants on the ground. 4. Since physics never works for the coyote, he uses it as a weapon by baiting the Road Runner\'s bird seed with iron pellets and mounting a bomb and a magnet on an old-fashioned clamp-on roller skate; however, the magnetic force is strong enough to separate the skate into two pieces, leaving the bomb close to the coyote. A puzzled Wile E. pokes his head up from his hiding place and is obliterated by the bomb. 5. Not having learned from the last physics outing, Wile E. drops a bowling ball through a pipe section, trying to squash his rival. It misses the Road Runner, and the ball\'s weight causes it to bounce straight back up through the pipe and hit its owner in the face. Wile E. is thrown up into the air, and down through the pipe and onto the ground, followed by the bowling ball to add insult to injury. 6. With all the forces of nature against him, the coyote plugs himself into an ACME Indestructo Steel Ball to avoid them, and rolls himself off an escarpment. However, he narrowly misses his intended target  and pitches himself onto a serac and into a dam. He rolls himself up out of the water, and then directly down a wall, over several rocks, and then back into the water. Wile E. finally pokes out of the ball to realize where he is going: off the edge again. He falls directly down the waterfall, into a mash of water, and finally out of the dam, but instead onto an old enemy: railroad tracks. He gets out, relieved, but soon gets back inside for shelter when he sees an approaching train, which hits the ball and sends it directly into an abandoned mine field. One explosion dents the ball and sends him back into the air, and then down to the same escarpment as before. The entire sequence repeats, and after Wile E. misses him for a second time, the Road Runner holds up a sign that says HERE WE GO AGAIN, beeps, and dashes to the side. The title is based on the song title "I\'m Just Wild About Harry".'] ['Moe and Larry read in the newspaper that the relatives of the late Professor Robert O. Link are searching for Curly Q.

Suddenly, Ralph reads in the paper that all the trees in the forest are disappearing, and he and Melissa worry that their home is next. Not too far away from the Raccoondominium, local aardvark millionaire Cyril Sneer is revealed to be the tree thief. His plan is to cut down every tree in the forest and make a profit out of the lumber. His college-educated son Cedric tries to talk him out of his crazed plans to destroy the whole forest, reasoning that they already have enough trees. Cyril ignores Cedric and chops down a whole line of trees, including the Raccoondominium. However, Cyril loses the Raccoons' tree and Tommy, Julie, and Schaeffer find it and take it home. Left without a home, the Raccoons try to find who's behind the destruction of the forest. Ralph sees the kids and Schaeffer dragging it to the cabin and deduces that they are the ones responsible for stealing all the trees and they follow the kids to get their home back. Tommy and Julie go to town to collect presents for their dad, leaving Schaeffer alone in the cabin. The Raccoons make their way inside where they find the Raccoondominium decorated with ornaments, tinsel, and lights. As Melissa tries to get their Christmas stockings back, Schaeffer wakes up from his nap and chases the Raccoons through the forest. The chase leads the four animals to Cyril's lumber headquarters, where Schaeffer finds out the truth about his family's Christmas tree, as do the Raccoons about his innocence. The animals then team up to plan to catch the real tree thief. As Cyril and Cedric head out to cut down the rest of the trees in the forest, the Raccoons and Schaeffer catch the two Sneers. After some convincing that there's a profit in planting trees, Cyril eventually promises to replant all of the trees. Schaeffer hears the kids calling for him in the distance and he and the Raccoons leave in triumph. The animals are pleased that they have saved the forest, but the Raccoons are upset that they are left without a home. The four walk back to the cabin, wish each other a Merry Christmas, and Schaeffer returns to the cabin, where Julie and Tommy wait for him. Just then, Julie and Tommy see the homeless Raccoons in the cold and realize that their Christmas tree must be the Raccoons' home. Julie phones their father to ask him to find a new home for them. Dan agrees and the group celebrate. The next day, the kids rush to open their presents, but are surprised that it's only Christmas Eve and they must have dreamt the events of the previous 'day'. However, Dan tells the kids that the trees have miraculously stopped being cut down. He reads a newspaper article to them which says that thousands of seedlings were planted overnight, but the identity of the one responsible is unknown. Suddenly, Schaeffer alerts the kids to the window again and they can see the Raccoons and a new re-planted tree not far from the cabin.

Taylor tells her that she has walked out, and left her phone. Fearing that Terra knows of the murder, he arms himself with a kitchen knife, but she leaves before he attacks her. Whilst disposing of the blood-stained towels used to clean the kitchen, Taylor takes a saw from his garage, and takes Jenny's body into the bathroom. Once he has put the body in the bath, Taylor closes Jenny's eyes, and prepares to cut her arm off. However, he is interrupted at the last moment by the shower curtain moving. He goes to investigate, and looks back to find Jenny's eyes now open again. The curtain moves again, and Taylor jumps back, hits the light switch, and falls to ground. The curtain is then pulled back, and a shadowed figure steps out from behind it. Taylor runs from the bathroom, and then the house. Whilst outside, a police car pulls up, and Taylor returns to the house. When Police Officer Diaz  knocks on the door, Taylor tries to stop her from entering the house. When she does, she begins to search the ground floor and, on finding nothing, goes to search upstairs. Taylor again attempts to convince her that there is no issue, and is forced to remain downstairs whilst Diaz searches the upper floor. Diaz does not enter the bathroom, and therefore does not discover Jenny's body, but Taylor stabs her in the neck as she turns to leave. The two struggle silently, with Taylor pushing Diaz's gun down into its holster to protect himself. He is interrupted by an apparition of Jenny standing at the door, giving Diaz time to draw her weapon and shoot him. The two separate, and fall against opposite sides of the room, where they sit against the walls, dying."] ['Because one of Larry\'s silly songs, "The Song of the Cebu" was so silly and confusing, Archibald Asparagus has replaced Silly Songs with Larry with "Love Songs with Mr. Lunt" which makes Larry very depressed and to drown his sorrows in Jimmy\'s ice cream parlor.

The next segment shows Peppermint Patty and Marcie at school, followed by a gym class, in which Peppermint Patty leads the other characters in a work out while she sings "I\'m in Shape".

Throughout the film, Duke Ellington and His Orchestra play noteworthy and famous Ellington pieces such as "Black and Tan Fantasy", "Black Beauty", "The Duke Steps Out", and "Cotton Club Stomp" ", as an artist to artist tribute for a fellow great African-American performer, Florence Mills, who died in 1927. The film starts with a scene in which it is established that Duke Ellington’s band is struggling to book any sort of gig or venue in order to make money and save his possessions such as his piano and apartment, due to the failure of making payments. Two heavily racially stereotyped black men arrive to take possession of Duke\'s piano. In the fictional story, Duke Ellington’s wife, Fredi Washington, who is a dancer, achieves fame and great acclaim way beyond the acknowledgment for the band. She walks in and offers the movers ten dollars. The movers refuse the payment so the lithe and stunning Fredi Washington offers them gin instead, and the movers are persuaded to speak nothing of this and act completely unaware of the piano. Recently landing a dancing job at a club, Fredi offers the solution to solve all of Duke Ellington’s problems by offering a venue for him and his band to perform at, but requires herself to perform with her star presence and dancing expertise in order to land the pending contract that the club is offering. Unfortunately the famous and deeply in love dancer has a heart condition that will become more detrimental if she continues to dance. Being warned to give up her career, Fredi boldly ignores her health issues and selflessly assures Duke that she is healthy enough to perform, which ultimately leads to her dancing herself to death to the Duke Ellington’s tune, “Black and Tan Fantasy”. In the film there is a heavy emphasis on the music and symbolism of African American influence on jazz, the struggle and rage of the Harlem of the 1920s, and the realities of the era for the African-American people."Wild Realm Reviews: Black & Tan." Film Reviews at The Weird Wild Realm of Paghat the Ratgirl. Web. 15 February 2011. <http://www.weirdwildrealm.com/f-duke-ellington3.html>.  Some of the noteworthy compositions of Duke Ellington that are played throughout the film are “The Duke Steps Out”, which features the talents of Arthur Whetsel, who performs an aweing melodic tone with a trumpet solo . During the main part of Fredi’s dance, “Black Beauty” is played, but rather than a sexually appealing performance there is a more profound symbolism found in her dancing. She dances as a contained artistic soul in rage wanting to exhibit her talents fully, which greatly portrays her struggle to shine and perform on film but unfortunately cannot due to her unique skin tone which therefore prevents her from solidly landing traditional Hollywood roles.Smith, Roberta.

He parks his car at a sidewalk by the place and goes toward the entrance. Before he reaches the door, Oswald was flagged down by the bellhop who tells him that parking in the sidewalk was not permitted. As a solution, Oswald compressed his car with his hands until it was hand-sized. The rabbit drops the tiny vehicle in his shorts and gives the bellhop a raspberry, and carried on. Coming to the night club also was a large wolf. Holding onto the wolf\'s garments is his cub who refuses to be left out.

Knowing his father is still inside, the wolf cub tries to follow the moving building but couldn\'t keep up. As he stops, he comes across an opaque telephone booth at a park. The wolf cub asked his question but only received silence. Desperate, the little wolf rips open the booth. In turns out that what\'s inside was a Tibetan man making a phone call.  The wolf cub\'s quote "Is my father in there?" would later be used two later cartoons produced by Lantz. It was inspired by short films and other media published several years earlier which used similar words. Back then, women and youngsters had to enter taverns through a door other than the main one.

Coyote  trudges across the desert floor, catching and eating anything that he finds to satisfy himself, ranging from a fly to an empty tin can, before being flattened by the Road Runner . Wile E., after recovering, blinks his eyes and visualizes a wonderful Road Runner feast. Seeing no need for a comparatively tawdry can, he chases the Road Runner. Wile\'s low stance reduces his drag and allows him to approach the Road Runner until the bird rockets away. The coyote\'s eyes pop out of his sockets and he is left dejectedly planning his next scheme. 1. First, the coyote uses a pulley, rope and rock trap to smash the passing Road Runner, evidently hoping the extra complexity will stop himself from being squashed instead. No dice; Wile E. is squashed by the rock as the Road Runner stops and mocks him. 2. The clearly angry coyote, with a lasso in the road, listens for the Road Runner, but a truck trips the lasso first, dragging the coyote across the hard ground. Wile E. is left with a bare rear end from friction as he paces off the road. 3. The coyote builds a Burmese tiger trap according to a How-To book: dig a square hole in the road and fill it with a sheet camouflaged as road. He hides behind a rock and, hearing the Road Runner beep and the trap activate, dives in to capture his prey...but instead, he gets throttled by a real Burmese tiger , which stealthily climbs out of the trap. 4. The camera displays a road with a pop-up grate intended to block the Road Runner; Wile tests its crank control successfully, but it fails to deploy against the speeding Road Runner. The coyote unsuccessfully tries numerous methods of unspringing the grate, then resumes the chase in outrage and is soon stopped by a railroad crossing. The Road Runner taunts his nemesis as he slowly prances the tracks, and the coyote is lifted into the air by the striped divider. After falling back down, Wile E. chases the Road Runner down the tracks, which run through mountains. The two pass by opposite lanes and the Road Runner signals the coyote, who stops cold after a few seconds and turns back, and after again running past the bird, he reverses only to find the Road Runner has escaped to a lower track. When he finally pursues the bird across the correct track, Wile is stopped by a train, and dashes in and out of a rockface; he sees the train proceed across an inferior track, and sighs with relief until a second train approaches from inside the rock. The apoplectic coyote holds up a circular STOP IN THE NAME OF HUMANITY sign, but since Wile E. isn\'t human, nothing happens except for the crash. 5. Next, Wile E. digs a corrugated culvert intending to mine the road with TNT, but the wires are short enough that he pulls the detonator over, which squeezes onto a loose rock and explodes the TNT while Wile inhabits the culvert. 6. The Coyote starts a speed motorcycle in pursuit of a passing Road Runner, but simply slams into a tree and is then jiggled around by the intense engine vibrations. 7. Now, Wile E. baits a white circle in the middle of a wide suspension bridge with bird seed, then hides underneath the bridge to cut out the circle as the Road Runner feasts. Instead, Wile falls along with the entirety of the bridge except for the bird and circle left floating in midair. 8. Finally, the Coyote attempts to outrun his rival by ingesting ACME Triple-Strength Fortified Leg Muscle Vitamins. He burns rubber on the road and dashes off, leaving the highway aflame. The Road Runner watches his foe approach and, from a standing start with a tongue-flapping beep, matches that speed instantly with about a one-second lead. This warp-speed chase continues, with the Coyote getting as close as a half-second at a valley and the Road Runner gaining distance on uphill grades, until they pass by the cranked-up grate, which finally rises for only Wile E. to smash into. The bird brakes and views his hapless rival before burning more rubber on the road, spelling out "That\'s all, folks" in smoke. The End.'] ['The Stooges are small time song-and-dance performers who are having trouble rehearsing due to loud tapping that is going on one story above them.

Sam, Duke of Yosemite finds out from his big-nosed servant that his uncle, the King, has decided to cut off his allowance. Sam punishes the servant for this message by giving him the nose-in-the-book penalty . Sam is desperate for money. Bugs Bunny comes to his door offering one million pounds to a mild-tempered person. Whenever Sam loses his temper, a small fraction of the one million pounds will be deducted, the size of the fraction depending on what Bugs thinks it suits . Sam welcomes Bugs into his home, anxious to receive the one million pounds. Bugs plays the role of an annoying house guest, presumably to test Sam, this naturally provokes Yosemite Sam to lose his temper and losing more money. Bugs asks Sam for multiple items at dinner. Each time he is asked for something, Sam loses his temper, and shouts out phrases like “Rackin’ Frackin’ Varmint Rabbit”. Each time Sam loses his temper, he loses money as well. This gets him even madder, causing him to lose his temper over and over again. Going into a closet to rant and rave doesn\'t help as Bugs can hear him , so Sam has to run outside to rant and rave. That night, Bugs keeps provoking Sam by playing the piano and singing his version of "Jeanie with the Light Brown Hair" obnoxiously  while Sam is trying to sleep. Sam screams "Stop that music, ya crazy rackin\', frackin\', varmint rabbit!". After Bugs deducts some more money for Sam losing his temper, Sam asks Bugs to sing him to sleep by playing "Brahms\' Lullaby." Bugs then becomes a one-man band and ticks off Sam even more, though Sam pretends to believe that he likes it. Next morning, Bugs hogs the bathroom and when Sam knocks on the door and demands him to "Get out of there!", Bugs opens it quickly and accidentally smashes Sam between the door and the wall . When Sam shouts at him to get out, Bugs deducts even more money . Already furious, Sam pounds his head on the piano, making Bugs think Sam\'s playing a song. Realizing he\'s not going to have any money left if the temper-money deductions keep up, Sam gets an idea to kill Bugs in order to receive all of the one million pounds – an idea he plans to make look like an accident. Each time Sam tries to kill Bugs, it backfires, causing Sam to fall into his own trap and get injured. First, he saws a hole in the floor outside the bathroom door and tries to get Bugs to come out by telling him somebody wants to see him, but Bugs orders Sam to tell whoever it is to come back the next day as he\'ll be in the bathroom all day. This makes Sam mad enough to bust into the bathroom and push Bugs out, only to fall through the hole intended for Bugs and land in the river below and the gibberish, "perka-shorka-bat-flattin\'-port\xadin-filabunkabertin\', perkalooma burtin\' dirtin\' boostinattin\' bartin\' anatom" curse while falling. When Sam returns and Bugs tells him he\'s done with the bathroom, Sam rushes at him to strangle him, but falls through the hole and into the river again, again cursing the entire way down. Later, Bugs climbs up a really long staircase . At the top, Sam, dressed in a suit of armor, tries to chop off Bugs\' head with a double-bladed axe, but Bugs ducks and he falls down the stairs. While falling down the stairs, Sam continues to rant, curse and rave, and Bugs continues the deductions . Finally, the next day, Sam gets control of his temper. He tries to show Bugs this by having his servants physically abuse him by kicking him , throwing pies in his face, and hitting him with a rolling pin . Bugs looks at the camera and says: “I haven’t got the heart to tell him that he’s used up all the money” as the cartoon fades out.'] ['Ben and Ellen use the elevator in their building when all of a sudden, Hank, the blood covered security man of the building rushes into the elevator, claiming that there is a dangerous alien-like creature in the building.'] ['Betty leaves her pet Pudgy home alone with three adorable little kittens.

Several decades earlier, Dr. Henderson\'s father discovered a series of caverns that he named the "Henderson caves." The elder Dr. Henderson explored the caves for several years before he mysteriously disappeared in them. Now, the younger Dr. Henderson would like to go back into the caverns. He would like the Daily Planet to fund the expedition, and he would like Clark Kent and Lois Lane to come along and report on everything they find. Mr. White agrees. Several days later, Clark, Lois and Dr. Henderson are at the entrance to the Henderson caves, ready to go spelunking. The caverns are part of a river system, so the only way into the caverns is by boat. Lois and Dr. Henderson take the first boat, and Clark follows later. Inside the cave, Lois and Dr. Henderson row into a large grotto. They dock on the side of the river, but once they step out, the boat drifts off down the river. A sack of dynamite in the boat is accidentally ignited and causes an explosion that Clark, who is just entering the caverns, can hear outside. Sensing danger, Clark paddles faster.

Though they are never named, they will be referred to by these titles in the article. They cast themselves onto a small island where they sit next to each other. Many days pass on the island, and they soon choose to express themselves. It starts in small ways, simply making noise. The three quickly start to annoy each other, and they soon stop. As more time passes, however, they begin to express their idea. Truth is first. He sits in various strange yoga positions and begins to project different shapes, such as suns, lotus flowers and four almond-shaped eyes. These eyes move around in strange patterns before becoming part of a strange four-eyed demon who dances for a moment then explodes. A pinball bounces between many pairs of eyes, building up speed before landing on Truth\'s head, which causes him to visualize a gradually expanding shape, and eventually reveals itself to be a huge, beautiful flower. The shape, though, collapses, which stuns Truth out of his trance, much to his embarrassment. Beauty then begins to express himself, performing ballet and transforming into a Nubian figure. He continues to dance, and morph into calligraphy-like shapes before changing to his normal shape, but in a white robe. He begins to play a flute, flowers growing around him as he plays faster and faster before he becomes one himself. A Greek statue is then seen, of a female. The William Tell Overture begins to play, and a tall man and a short man carrying a frame walk up to the statue and "capture" her inside it, removing its head and base. They walk on as the Overture plays, but the picture soon splits in half, since the men walk at different speeds. Confused, they put it back together after several odd attempts, and soon climb a long staircase with it. They climb high up into the sky into an art gallery, where it\'s placed with hundreds of identical pictures, except for one. This picture shows a scene where a small head, in profile, sees an object and begins to talk happily about it, his speaking expressed by a cello playing. Another man comes next to him, facing him, and sees the object as well. He discusses it with him, but the two heads soon begin arguing harshly. A pillar grows out from under the left head, making him sit above the other. He responds by growing another column underneath him, and the two heads quickly try to one-up each other, their columns growing and their arguing becoming worse. Soon, they can\'t go any higher, and push themselves into each other, forming a babbling head in front-view. The scene zooms out to show dozens of these heads on high columns, chattering away. Beauty\'s vision ends here, and he bows to the other two. Good expresses himself next, kissing the other two and dancing. He soon transforms into a figure with a robe, and begins to make noises like a pipe organ, and then transforms into a church-like structure with an onion dome. Small black figures go through a door at his base, and turn white as they go through it. He then transforms into a warrior with a huge sword and shield, blood running down his sword, before abruptly changing back to his old shape. A beautiful woman approaches and tries to seduce him, but he pushes her away. Another figure comes up and offers him wine, but he flattens him with a hammer, then transforms into a futuristic warrior with a ray gun. A large heart comes out of the ray gun and shatters, breaking his meditation. He looks embarrassed. More time passes, and Beauty starts to express himself again, changing into the Nubian figure with a harp, playing a repetitive tune and swishing his long hair. This annoys Good, who responds by gathering smaller figures to join hands around him and playing the same tune back at him. Truth, hovering overhead, is annoyed at both of them. After trying to outdo each other, they all abruptly change back. Soon, though, Beauty is at it again, and Good responds by forming into a warrior with a blunderbuss and a small army gathers around him. Initially concerned, Beauty responds by changing into the Nubian figure with a fencing foil. Good attempts to shoot him, but Beauty dodges his shots and skewers his army  and starts playing them like his harp, which infuriates Good. Truth hovers above, angry at the both of them, and after a sporadic fit, a snake coils around him, possibly representing the caduceus. After this, they all change back, but Good and Beauty are plotting against each other. Good raises his fist, which grows and grows until it hovers over him and flattens him, possibly representing punishment for thinking evil thoughts. Good grows into a huge monster, ten times the size of the other two, but each time he does, the fist bears down on him again. In response, Beauty turns back into the figure, this time with a bow and arrow, and shoots the fist, to Good\'s alarm. A drop of blood falls on Good, which sends him into a rage as Beauty cockily plays his tune on his bow. He changes into the monster, grabs Beauty, throws him against the ground and kicks him. He pulls off his hair and throws it back at him, which causes Beauty to lose his temper, and he transforms into a similar monster to fight Good. Good and Beauty approach each other with daggers and soon run into each other. They get tangled up, and soon start to resemble a bull. Up above, tangled in the Caduceus, Truth is angry at them. He puts on a labcoat, and the Caduceus transforms into a chemistry coil. Good and Beauty soon appear to transform into a machine, tank treads, nuts and rivets appearing across their bodies, much to Truth\'s dismay. He walks over to a chalkboard and begins to write formulas on it. As he does, it grows and grows, and eventually takes on the shape of a giant nuclear bomb, 100 times his size, pointed down at them. He doesn\'t notice it initially until it begins to tick. The ticking builds and builds as the three look on, terrified. It soon explodes, and the three men change back. Horrified by this vision, they immediately leave the island.'] ['The short film opens with Mater playing pranks on the other residents of Radiator Springs.

The narrator opens by asking the viewer if they ever think about the people they went to school with. He goes on to talk about his "best mate", Johnno, a popular and rebellious boy at school. However, Johnno turns out to be a thoroughly obnoxious and violent person, frequently swindling, stealing, vandalizing property and generally committing antisocial acts. He apparently enjoys cruelty to animals, throwing hamsters and cats off high-rise flats and bricking ducks. Johnno once confused the narrator by falsely telling him his father had died .

The episode opens with Bob and Larry on the countertop as usual and Bob remarks that the other day he ran into a boy named "Marco". Marco says that when his little sister does something that makes him upset and then apologizes, his mother says he needs to forgive her. But Marco asks "Why do I have to forgive?" In response, Larry tells a story in a style akin to John Steinbeck\'s The Grapes of Wrath. In this segment, Pa Grape makes his VeggieTales debut as the father of family of cranky grapes, The Grapes of Wrath, who seemingly live off name-calling and insults.http://www.christiananswers.net/spotlight/movies/pre2000/rvu-veg2.html While driving down the road, they spot Junior Asparagus playing with his dump truck and begin to try and figure out what he is, even mistaking his hat for cheese and calling him "Bean Boy". When he corrects them by taking off his cap, the Grapes laugh at him due to his large hair, hurting his feelings and making him cry. He is then helped by his dad who explains to the Grapes that it isn\'t nice to pick on people and Junior forgives the Grapes at his dad\'s urging. However, after Junior falls down a hill and crashes into his sandbox, the Grapes laugh at Junior again and he is unwilling to forgive them a second time. Because of Junior\'s unforgiveness, Bob and Larry interact with the story and try to figure out how many times one should forgive. Qwerty then shows the multiplication problem "What is 70 X 7" - a bible verse from the NT {{Bibleref2c}}. When Rosie figures out the answer to Qwerty\'s question, the Grapes ask for Junior\'s forgiveness and the "Grapes of Wrath" are renamed "The Grapes of Math".

Instead the Silly Song was replaced with an advertisement starring Scallion #1 for a machine used to predict that God would forgive your sin called "The Forgive-O-Matic." Junior however interrupts the commercial and tries to convince Scallion #1 that he should instead simply ask God for forgiveness. Scallion #1 then tries to re-advertise The Forgive-O-Matic as a julienne fry maker and a Chia model.

Born to a drug addicted mother, Walter was in foster care until Dees managed to get him released into her care at the age of four. He was a very disturbed child, traumatized by the death of his father and the disappearance of his mother, while still appearing bright and sweetly loving to his grandmother. The film focuses on the continuous battle against age discrimination faced by Dees and many like her. While contending with her own declining health, and a bureaucratic and legal system that continually threatens to force them apart, Dees fights the misconception that age supersedes one's ability to love and care for a child.

It passes another train going around a utility pole, and voices are heard repeating "Bread and Butter". Bugs is riding in the mail car of a train, singing a nonsense song called "Go Get the Axe", when a pint-sized bandit attempts to rob the train , only to have it pass clear over his head. He then calls for his horse, which he needs a rolling step-stair to mount. He catches up and boards the train and begins to rob it while the mail clerk wraps himself in a package marked DON\'T OPEN \'TIL XMAS. The bandit accidentally throws Bugs Bunny in his sack. Bugs assumes he\'s Jesse James. The bandit scoffs and tells him  who he actually is: "I\'m Yosemite Sam, the meanest, toughest, rip-roarin\'-est, Edward Everett Horton-est hombre what ever packed a six-shooter!"  Bugs tells Sam that there is another tough guy in the train packing a "seven-shooter", and Sam goes looking for him – and he is actually Bugs in disguise. Various fights ensue, as each character temporarily gets the upper hand for a while. After another skirmish, Bugs tricks Sam into dashing into a lounge car in which a horrific fight is occurring, actually stock film footage of a stereotypical western saloon fight, taken from the Warner Brothers western Dodge City. With the sounds of crashes and bangs in the background, Bugs calmly sings "Sweet Georgia Brown" to himself. Sam emerges tottering, banged and bruised, to a comical instrumental of "Rally \'Round the Flag", and a race-based gag occurs that is subtle enough it is usually left intact in network showings: Bugs effects the stereotyped voice of an African-American train porter, and has the dazed Sam convinced he\'s supposed to disembark the train, piling him up with luggage; Sam even hands Bugs a silver coin as a tip, and Bugs says, "Thank you, suh!" As Sam steps off the moving train, the mail-drop hook grabs him and temporarily whisks him off the train. Bugs thinks he has vanquished Sam, and yells "So long, screwy, see ya in Saint Louie!" in a line that will be echoed in Bugs Bunny Rides Again and A Feather in His Hare. But he gets back on board somehow. Finally, Sam has Bugs tied up, dangling from a rope, weighted down by an anvil, and fiendishly cutting through the rope, while the train is passing over a gorge. The screen fills with the words the narrator  is saying, "Is this the end of Bugs Bunny? Will our hero be dashed to bits on the jagged rocks below?" and so on. Then Bugs walks across the screen, dressed in top hat and tails, carrying a bag full of gold , and dragging the tied-up villain behind him, mocking the on-screen words . Bugs closes by turning to the audience and repeating a popular radio catch-phrase from Red Skelton\'s "Mean Widdle Kid": "He don\'t know me vewy well, do he?" as a bar of Kingdom Coming plays on the track at iris-out.'] ["Scenes are introduced using lines of the poem.{{Cite book}} and finishes his work in the workshop.

A squirrel merrily runs around and heads to the groundhog's house to tell the latter of the good news. Upon coming out and hearing what the squirrel told him, the groundhog turned around and was surprised to see his shadow on the wall of his house. He then warns the squirrel and the other animals nearby that if his shadow is visible, more days of snow await. The other animals, however, were doubtful of his advice and therefore took it as a joke. On another part of the countryside, Oswald and an unnamed sister of his are working on their inn after it had been closed for the winter. They dust the furniture and shake the dirt off the carpets. After completing their tasks, the inn was ready for service. Oswald and his sister went outside for a little stroll. As the two inn operators are at the open and spending time with some animals, the groundhog approached and warn them once more about more winter days coming. Again, they all thought it was just a bluff and began to laugh. But they would stop laughing when snowflakes fall to the ground. Finally realizing the truth of the groundhog's warning, everybody hurried back indoors."] ['Elmer Fudd has purchased Bugs Bunny at a local grocery store  and is taking him home to make a meal. As he bounces along, he sings the tune of "Shortnin\' Bread", substituting "Wabbit Stew". Bugs pops out of Elmer\'s basket, munching on a carrot that was in there with him, and asks, "Eh, whatcha got in the basket, doc?" Elmer replies, "I got me a wabbit! I\'m gonna cook me a wabbit stew!" Bugs states his "love" of rabbit stew  and then begs to see Elmer\'s rabbit. When Elmer opens his basket and finds it empty , Bugs pushes his nemesis into his own basket and then sings the tune Elmer had been singing &mdash; but then Elmer realizes he\'s been tricked, and so he re-reverses the switch. Foreshadowing pranks to come, Bugs tells the audience from inside the basket , "He don\'t know me vewy well, do he?" Once at home, Bugs easily secures his escape by distracting Elmer, tricking him into thinking the phone has rung. However, just as he\'s about to leave, he decides he\'d rather stay and heckle his would-be devourer. Bugs effects a radio broadcast that warns of the dread disease "rabbititus", which is contracted from rabbits "sold within the last three days" and which causes people to see spots and have "delusions assuming the characteristics of rabbits", among other dubious symptoms. This frightens the gullible Elmer and he informs Bugs that he is free to leave. Bugs, however, decides he doesn\'t want to leave by saying "Oh, no, Doc. Wouldn\'t think of it. We\'re gonna brew a stew, remember?", only to make Elmer back away, forcing him to hide on top of his door: "Oh no! Pwease, Mr. Wabbit! Go away! Don\'t come any cwoser! D-Don\'t come near me! NO!!!!!!!!!". Bugs, thinking he has B.O., sniffs his glove and tells the audience "Oh, goodness! Don\'t tell me I offend." just as Elmer pleas Bugs to "Make twacks. Scuwwy away. SCWAM!" to which Bugs angrily replies as he leaves "OKAY! I CAN TAKE A HINT! I KNOW WHEN I\'M NOT WANTED! GOODBYE!". But when Bugs returns, Elmer reminds him that Bugs has to "Scwam", but Bugs points to a sign on the door that states "QUARANTINED FOR RABBITITUS. NO ONE MAY LEAVE PREMISES." Thus Bugs stays to torment Elmer, and many hijinks ensue, including Bugs posing as Elmer\'s shower faucets {"Gurgle, gurgle. Why don\'t ya\' pay ya\' water bill, Doc?"} and a doctor , and pretending to be Elmer\'s reflection in the mirror (a scene inspired by the famous mirror scene in the Marx Brothers\' film, [[Duck Soup . And when Dr. Killpatient  tests Elmer\'s reflexes, Elmer goes into a familiar Russian kick dance, and Bugs decides to join him in a busby hat and boots; the subsequent heys are hilarious! Finally, Elmer sees Bugs\' game and chases him out of the house with a shotgun. But Bugs quickly halts the chase and, in an unusually lengthy breaking of the fourth wall, even by Bugs\' standards, he convinces Elmer that members of the audience are now afflicted with rabbititus by saying "Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Look, the people out there in the audience - the lady there with the long ears. They\'re getting longer all the time. And the guy back there in the seventeenth row with the cute tomato - he\'s gettin\' all fuzzy. Yeah, they\'ve got it. Everybody out there\'s got rabbititus! Yaah!" which causes Elmer to flee back into his house in a terror of panic. Bugs then addresses the audience and says the whole thing was "just a gag, of course" and that if the audience really had rabbititus, they\'d see swirling red and yellow spots, whereupon red and yellow spots are seen swirling on the screen, and the underscore starts to build dramatically. Immediately after Bugs says, "And then suddenly, everything\'d go black!" the screen does suddenly go black, and the music stops abruptly and dramatically, followed by a second or two of dark silence. Bugs snickers and the cartoon ends.'] ['Laurel and Hardy are almost on their way to Atlantic City with their wives, when Ollie gets a phone call from Cookie, a lodge buddy.

The soundtrack consists of a single continuous piece by composer Michael Stearns. Filmed in dozens of locations on five continents, the film relates to the concept of time passing on different scales—the bulk of the film covers the history of civilization, from pre-history to Egypt to Rome to Late Antiquity to the rise of Western Europe in the Middle Ages to the Renaissance to the modern era. It centers on European themes but not exclusively. Other time scales include the passing of seasons, and the passing of night and day, and the passing shadows of the sun in an afternoon to the passing of people on the street.

When the cartoon restarts, the Road Runner leaves the train and runs onto the main roads, with the coyote watching from above. He glances from side to side, and the camera freezes for Wile E. Coyote  halfway through his head turning. True to this name, he ventures down the mountain and toward the road, waiting for the familiar Beep-beep sound; when this reaches his ears, he jumps into a 4-way intersection, but the Road Runner mows him down from behind. When the seething coyote stands up, facing the opposite direction, he is flattened from the other side, and then eventually from all four directions. The camera cuts to Wile E., who looks increasingly annoyed as this sequence repeats over and over until the camera cuts away. 1. Lying in wait behind a rock with a hand grenade, the coyote mistakenly chews off the grenade and throws the stop at the Road Runner, and once Wile E. realizes the gaffe, the explosion hits. 2. Wile E. now inspects the roads from a high overlook and peers out to see that the Road Runner has disappeared temporarily. That ends when the bird pops up behind Wile E. and beeps, then dashes away, leaving a lifesize cloud of dust behind that also beeps at the coyote. He reclines on the rail, miffed at the turn of events. 3. As the cartoon returns to the regular desert scenery, Wile E. gingerly drops a bunch of mousetraps onto the road, but when the Road Runner zooms past, instead of getting trapped in them, the traps drop onto Wile in his trench hideout. The coyote\'s reaction is delayed briefly before he yelps in pain. 4. Resorting now to ACME products, these being a kite kit and bomb, Wile E. leaps in the air several times in an attempt to go airborne, but soon runs off the edge of the cliff he is on, and he falls to the ground and his own bomb explodes on him. 5. The Road Runner is zipping along some roads while Wile E. is chopping down a power pole. Wile E. confirms the path of the Road Runner and finishes chopping, but he is too late. When the power pole that Wile E. chopped traverses the road, all of the other poles fall as well due to the power lines pulling them down. The one directly to the left lands directly on Wile and knocks him into the ground. 6. Living up to the Wile part of his name, Wile E. offers bird seed mixed with steel shot to the Road Runner, who stops his road-burning and has a quick snack. Wile E. jumps out behind the bird as he speeds away with a giant magnet, but lucky only he could be, a big TNT canister is attracted to the magnet and another explosion results, twisting the magnet into a pretzel and knocking Wile E. back through a rock face. 7. Delving deeper into wily trickery, the coyote learns hypnotism from a book to induce the Road Runner to jump off a cliff. He tests the method successfully on a small bug by projecting a static lightning from his hands. However, when he jumps out and tries to hit the Road Runner with it, the bird is wise to this, holding a mirror that causes the lightning to be reflected back to Wile E. who, in only succeeding in hypnotising himself, obligingly walks off the cliff. 8. The Road Runner taunts his opponent from above, and the coyote attempts to use a seesaw and rock contraption, but the rock simply falls directly back on its owner. 9. Now, Wile E. sets a gun trap for the Road Runner, with himself ready to activate the guns at a moment\'s notice. He hides behind a turn as the Road Runner runs into the trap. However, because of the force he applied to the strings, the guns are pulled into the crosshairs of the coyote when they are activated, and he ends up shooting himself. 10. The coyote now hides behind a rock as he waits for the Road Runner to speed across a treacherous suspension bridge. As the Road Runner crosses, Wile E. jumps out and cuts the ropes, but instead of causing the bridge to fall, the whole plateau that Wile E. inhabits falls down. The Road Runner brakes at the end of the bridge and continues his rampage. 11. Wile E. waits for the Road Runner to pass and then loads himself into a "human cannonball" cannon, which unfortunately recoils and is thrown backwards, leaving the coyote blackened. 12. The coyote is now on top of a rectangular board bridging a deep canyon with a large wrecking ball at his command. He drops the ball into a circular path, which would have hit the Road Runner if the bird hadn\'t stopped and waited. The ball continues its circle and ends up right back where it started - on top of the coyote. 13. One last time, the coyote attempts to ensnare his nemesis. He mines a canyon with myriad explosives behind a doorway with many "FREE BIRD SEED" declarations and connects the main controller to the door. Unfortunately, as soon as the coyote climbs over the wall, he encounters a gigantic truck. With no recourse, Wile E. opens the door and is blown up repeatedly, then run over by the truck. Wile E. sticks out his tongue and beeps in an imitation of the Road Runner, and then falls unconscious.'] ['A young brother and sister carry a wagon with pieces of wood, gathering them for their stove.

Even a stint of training at a boxing gym and use of the knife do not give Tom any advantage against Jerry. Finally Tom goes to a judo school in order to face him again. The two have a breaking contest, with each trying to outdo the other. The contest ends abruptly when Tom tries to break a huge block of marble, which crashes through the floor and takes him with it. The unconscious Tom ends up in the battered box. Jerry replaces the lid as the narrator explains, "Our next film will be for the kiddies, and will demonstrate a new poison gas. Thank you and good night." The music winds to a stop as if it were being played on a slowing phonograph record, and Jerry bows to the audience in typical Japanese fashion.'] ["The Pink Panther becomes a lumberjack, and ends up having to deal with killer bees and an overzealous lumberjack who continually cut downs trees in the panther's direction."] ["The Tasmanian Devil approaches the Jungle.

Some critics have cited similarities between these two characters and film critics Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert. Recurring characters in Vinton\'s films dating back to 1980, Rex and Herb introduce several stand-alone videos of Christmas carols and standards and discuss the origins of each song relating to different holiday traditions around the world. The songs featured were: * "We Three Kings" by the Three Wise Men and their doo-wop-singing camels * "Carol of the Bells" performed at Notre Dame Cathedral under the direction of Maestro Quasimodo by The Paris Bell-Harmonic, a group of anthropomorphic church bells who strike themselves in the head with hammers to achieve their respective notes * "O Christmas Tree" performed by a children\'s choir, showing various scenes taking place inside of Christmas ornaments * "Angels We Have Heard On High", an instrumental version of the carol with an interpretive ice ballet performed by a pair of walruses and six penguins. * "Joy to the World", a soulful rendition of the carol featuring images depicting African-American culture * "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer" sung by the California Raisins  * "Here We Come A-Wassailing" sung by the entire cast Throughout the program, Rex futilely attempts to clarify the true pronunciation and meaning of the term \'wassail\', featured in the Christmas carol Here We Come A-Wassailing. As the show progresses, Rex is dismayingly accosted by different groups singing the song, though each version is lyrically incorrect. *Here We Come a-Waffling, sung by a kennel of dogs selling waffles from a vendors wagon. *Here We Come a-Waddling, by a gaggle of straggling geese carrying baskets of goodies. *Here We Come a-Wallowing, by a herd of slovenly pigs on a field wagon gorging themselves on an abundance of assorted fruits.  Though Rex is convinced his own definition is correct, he finds himself continually being questioned by the others, including Herb when he\'s not busy excessively partaking of the various Christmas treats offered by each group. Finally, near the program\'s end, a large truck loaded with cider-swilling townsfolk arrives on the scene, singing the correct version of the carol, validating Rex\'s theories much to his delight. After one of the townies explains the real meaning of wassailing—going around the neighborhood singing Christmas Carols, and getting treats and cordials, the entire cast performs Here We Come A-wassailing, and then We Wish You a Merry Christmas as the end credits roll.

The cat then comes to a store selling car accessories to replace his lights. He wanted a pair of Mazda light bulbs but the store clerk tells him no stock of the product is available, and therefore makes suggestion of other lights, claiming they would work well also. Felix puts on the regular bulbs on his vehicle, and continues his travel.

As a Special Agent, Mikako pilots a Tracer, a giant robotic mecha as part of a fighting squadron attached to the spacecraft carrier Lysithea. When the Lysithea leaves Earth to search for the Tarsians with Mikako on board, Mikako\'s friend Noboru Terao remains behind. The two continue to communicate across interplanetary, and eventually interstellar space via the email facilities on their mobile phones. As the Lysithea travels deeper into space, the emails take increasingly longer to reach Noboru on Earth, and the time-lag of their correspondence eventually spans years. The narrative begins in 2047. Mikako is apparently alone in a hauntingly empty city, trying to contact people through her cell phone. She finally says, in an empty classroom with stacked chairs, "Noboru? I\'m going home, okay?", a rhetorical question which is answered with a busy line on her cell phone. Then she wakes up to discover that she is in her Tracer orbiting an alien gas giant. She then goes to Agartha, the  fourth planet of the Sirius System, . In the middle of the anime proper, she sends an email to Noboru , with the subject "I am here", saying "to the 24-year old Noboru, from the 15-year old Mikako" which would only reach him 8 years, 224 days and 18 hours later, and just hopes it reaches him. Some flashes of imagery, perhaps indicative of memory, a hallucination, or even a mystical encounter, are then shown. It is a morphing character that looks like a younger Mikako. While they\'re speaking however, that character morphs into a Tarsian and then into an older version of herself. The same room where she woke up in the beginning of the animation is presented again, with the same ambience, but this time she is squatting in the corner, sobbing and pleading with her doppelganger to let her see Noboru just one more time to be able to say "I love you" to him. The other being says "It will be all right. You will see him again". The ship\'s alarm starts warning her that the Tarsians are suddenly coming from everywhere. Mikako cries even more, yelling "I don\'t understand!". A climactic battle ensues. Meanwhile, back on Earth, Noboru receives the message, albeit almost 9 years in the future. A voice-over dialogue commences between the two of them which functions as a synchronous soliloquy on the same subject. Meanwhile, back at Agartha, three of the four carriers equipped with the warp engines which brought the expeditionary force to Sirius have been destroyed. The Lysithea is still intact after Mikako joins the fight and stops its destruction. After winning the battle, Mikako lets her damaged Tracer drift in space. Alternatively, in the manga 16 years old Mikako sends a message to 25 years old Noboru, telling him that she loves him. By this time Noboru has joined the UN, who have launched a rescue mission for the Lysithea. When Mikako hears the news from her crew mate that that UN is sending help for their rescue, she consults a list of people on the mission, Noboru being one of them. She ends by saying that they will definitely meet again.'] ['One evening in Storyland, the story book "Old King Cole" opens itself and the king\'s castle folds open.

Delirious from hunger, they start imagining each other  as food. They spot an island in the distance and rush ashore, underscored by "Down Where the Trade Winds Play", a song used several times in the cartoon , where they meet Bugs Bunny, who is munching on his carrot as usual. To his friendly, "What\'s the good word, strangers?" they answer "FOOD!" and start after Bugs, who leaps away on a vine with a Tarzan yell. Chasing Bugs through the jungle, they spy him, semi-disguised as one of the "natives", dancing. Bugs welcomes them with, "Ah! White Men! Welcome to Humuhumunukunukuapua\'a\'a\'a island." He then proceeds to speak in Polynesian-accented nonsense, a long stretch of which is subtitled simply "What\'s up Doc?" and a very short segment is subtitled, "Now is the time for every good man to come to the aid of his party." The tall and skinny man says, "Well, thanks!" and the short, fat man, actually seeing the peculiar subtitle, "Ofa eno maua te ofe popaa", says, "Gee, did you say that?" The skinny man shrugs. Bugs and the two men prepare the feast as they sing "We\'re gonna have roast rabbit" and Bugs realizes he\'s the roast rabbit and climbs back up his tree and then Bugs tricks them by substituting a skinned chicken for himself in the large cooking pot. He taunts them with the chicken, using it as a marionette in order to make the two men think the chicken is possessed by a Ghost, until the strings become tangled and he has to make a quick escape. As the castaways sob in frustration, they hear a steam whistle from a ship. As the men leap for joy at the prospect of being saved and trot toward the gangplank, Bugs kisses them goodbye and presents them with leis, then pulls his time-honored switcheroo trick and boards the ship himself. The boat pulls out, leaving the two men on the island, still waving goodbye to Bugs. The Skinny Man slaps the Fat Man  for still yelling "Goodbye!" The two at once imagine each other as a frankfurter and a hamburger, chasing each other into the distance as "Aloha Oe" plays on the underscore, and the cartoon irises out.'] ['Yukino and Kanade Sakurai, twin sisters and native from Hokkaido, move together to a student residence in Tokyo to attend high school leaving their younger sister, Shizuku "Shi-chan" with their parents.

Monokoa, a volcano which has been dormant for about 300 years. The last time it erupted, it destroyed a nearby island city completely and sent tidal waves around the world. Now, the volcano is showing signs of eruption, threatening the small town  yet again. Lois Lane and Clark Kent are sent to the scene by Perry White, who gives each of them steam tickets to the island, as well as press passes, ordering Lois to keep them safe as she stows them in her purse. On arrival, Clark can\'t find his press pass , and goes back into town to retrieve it as Lois takes a tour of the volcano. Her guide tells her that the plan to save the city is to blow a hole in the side of the volcano, thus altering the course of the lava flow from the town, to the ocean on the other side of the island. Suddenly, the volcano begins to erupt, and lava spews out of its top, flowing towards the town. Lois and her guide are separated. Two men on the other side of the volcano scramble to get to the machinery which will blow a hole in its side, but a giant boulder cuts the wire connecting the dynamite to the machine, rendering it useless. From the town below, Clark sees the volcano let out a particularly explosive blast and says, "This looks like a job for Superman." He changes into his costume and flies up to the volcano, catching a huge boulder hurtling toward the town and flinging it into the ocean.

While preparing, he receives a package in the mail, from his uncle Pinkus. The package contains a tiny silkworm, which sews garments  when the word "sew" is spoken—this later becomes a running gag. Porky commands the worm to sew, and the worm immediately sews a sock. Porky and Black Fury look on in awe. Porky again gives the command, and this time, the worms sews a brassiere, which Porky quickly disposes of bashfully. Porky and Black Fury then proceed to the bathroom, where Porky puts a sizeable amount of hair-growth formula on his head, producing no results. Regardless, he picks up a comb, and combs his "hair." Then realizing that he must get ready some more, Porky hurriedly leaves the bathroom. Black Fury then takes the bottle of formula, seeing that it contains 99% alcohol, and begins to taste and drink it. Not only does Black Fury become shaggy after ingesting the formula, but also becomes severely intoxicated, loudly shouting "Hap...py Birthday!" to the camera. Meanwhile, Porky puts the finishing touches on his cake and ice cream, when he hears a knock at the door. It is his friend Penguin, who gruffly mumbles "Happy Birthday, Porky", then rushes to the table and begins wolfing down ice cream. Goosey then saunters in the door, walking in his trademark loose, woobly fashion. Goosey holds out his hand for porky to shake, but Porky, upon doing so, realizes the hand is a prop, adorned with a sign reading "Happy Birthday, Fat Boy!". As Goosey is seated, Porky chuckles, turning to the camera and stating "He\'s so silly." However, Porky repeatedly stutters on the word "so", and the silkworm, in Porky\'s pocket, frantically begins sewing garment after garment. As the garments slide out from underneath Porky\'s jacket, he notices that they are all women\'s underwear and brassieres, and, as before, hides them guiltily. He then tosses the slikworm away. However, the silkworm lands into Penguin\'s ice cream, and upon his utterances of the word "so", the worm does its stuff. However, the garments are in the ice cream, so as Penguin is eating, he pulls out of his mouth, to his disgust, a sock. Then, Penguin is having trouble swallowing, and the audience sees that a top hat has gotten into Penguin\'s mouth, and pops up, with Penguin\'s head assuming the shape of the hat. After several failed attempts to quell the hat, Penguin shouts at Goosey to assist him. Goosey then unwittingly rams Penguin\'s head into the wall, hits him over the head with a mallet, and slams a washtub over his head, to no avail. By this time, Black fury, still intoxicated, attempts to shave himself upon the realization of his shagginess. However, after putting on the shaving cream, he attempts to start the electric razor. The razor, however, takes on the qualities of a snake, and attacks Black Fury, who promptly runs into the living room in fear. Porky mistakes Black fury for a mad dog, and Porky, Penguin, and Goosey all run around the house, with Black Fury close behind, unbeknownst to him that it is he who is the mad dog. After several gags and antics around the house, the shaving cream is removed, and Porky sees that it is just Black Fury after all. Penguin, angry at the dog, rolls up his "sleeve" and stares Black fury down, uttering "so.." in anticipation of a fight. This sets the silkworm off for the final time, wrapping Penguin up in several garments to a state of mummification, as the others look on.'] [' In a hotel lobby, the concierge answers a phone call from one of the guests\' rooms.

She tells him she is on her way from the airport and asks for his room number. Despite objecting that he did not tell her she could come, the man consents nevertheless.

Stepping back into the bedroom, the woman turns to face the man and confronts him, asking slowly "what the fuck is going on?"

Suddenly the pink panther has an idea, he can ride the horse to Anaheim . Crossing over to the horse\'s field, he tries to pet the horse, but the horse steps on his foot, as he tries to pull his foot away from the horse, he pulls his foot out of his pink sock  and yells in pain, for this he kicks the horse\'s rear.

We see a birds eye view of the horse in his field by the barn getting smaller as the ladder gets higher. Pink rushes to climb down the ladder as it starts to fall again.

Pink kicks his legs as if to tell the horse to giddy up, the horse suddenly flies into a spin fight with Pink and emerges with the panther on all fours, saddle on his back, with the horse sat in the saddle. Pink crouches there in disbelief as the horse lets out another of his manic horse laughs. Pink attempts to get on the horse, but fails. He puts roller skates on the horse, and gets on, but the horse roars down the hill, fast, and the horse and the Pink Panther end up landing on a train track, and the train chases them, in the end, Pink ends up crashing into a "STOP" sign sending him flying into the Anaheim sign.

The men in the saloon look suspiciously at Bugs, who requests a glass of carrot juice, to which an eager bartender give Bugs his best serving of carrot juice  then comments that Bugs\' rock "is pretty", to which Bugs pays the man while naively saying: "You like it?

Bugs requests to stand on one card, to which Blacque Jacque says "One... card?" to which he assertively says "Oh sure, sure!" clearly thinking this will be to his advantage to allow the supposedly gullible Bugs this irregular hand.

The images are frequently set to music and cut to the music's pace. The narrator focuses on the emotional qualities of the objects, and discusses the perception of African sculptures from a historical and contemporary European perspective. Only occasionally does the film provide the geographical origin, time period or other contextual information about the objects. The idea of a dead statue is explained as a statue which has lost its original significance and become reduced to a museum object, similarly to a dead person who can be found in history books. Interweaved with the objects are a few scenes of Africans performing traditional music and dances, as well as the death of a disemboweled gorilla. During the last third of the film, the modern commercialisation of African culture is problematised. The film argues that colonial presence has compelled African art to lose much of its idiosyncratic expression, in order to appeal to Western consumers. A mention is made of how African currencies previously had been replaced by European. In the final segment, the film comments on the position of black Africans themselves in contemporary Europe and North America. Footage is seen from a Harlem Globetrotters basketball show, of the boxer Sugar Ray Robinson, and a jazz drummer intercut with scenes from a confrontation between police and labour demonstrators. Lastly the narrator argues that we should regard African and European art history as one inseparable human culture."] ['{{plot}} At Sandy\'s treedome, Sandy is putting up Christmas lights.

But a surprise is in wait for them.'] ['The film revolves around high school student Kyle ([[Chris Evans , who needs a high score on the SAT to get into his preferred architecture program at Cornell University. He constantly compares himself to his older brother Larry, who is now living above his parents\' garage. Kyle\'s best friend, Matty , wants to get a high score so he can go to the same college as his girlfriend, but he is an underachiever who had previously received a low score on his PSAT. They both believe that the SAT is standing in the way of their futures. The two boys realize that fellow student Francesca Curtis\'  father owns the building that houses the regional office of ETS, where the answers to the SAT are located. Francesca initially doesn\'t want to help but changes her mind, saying "What the hell? It sounds like fun." Meanwhile, Kyle becomes attracted to Anna Ross , the second-highest ranked student in the school, and tells her about the plan. Anna had bombed a previous SAT and needs a good score to get into Brown University. However, Matty doesn\'t like the fact that she now knows about the plan and has an outburst, right in the presence of stoner Roy , who then has to be included in the heist. And finally, Anna tells the school basketball star Desmond Rhodes , who needs a score of 900 or better to join the basketball team at St. John\'s University. An early attempt to break into the ETS offices fails, but the team then devises another plan. On the eve of the exam, Francesca will arrange for Kyle and Matty to have a meeting near the top floor, staying after closing. The other three will wait outside and watch the night guard until Francesca, Kyle, and Matty have successfully stolen the answers. The first part of the plan goes well, with Francesca, Kyle, and Matty successfully dodging security cameras and the night guard. However, the answers are located on a computer, and only the technical genius Roy can crack the password; he and the other two get into the building, and Roy correctly guesses the password after seeing a photograph of an employee. Still, the answers can\'t be printed, so the group decides to take the test with their combined knowledge and get the answers that way. In the early hours of morning, they are finished and have all the answers written down. Just then, the guard ascends the stairs, and they try to escape through the ceiling; however, Francesca is left behind and is about to be discovered, so Matty purposefully gives himself up in order to save her. Everyone else escapes, but each faces a certain confrontation before the exam: Kyle\'s brother asks him if he\'s really worse than a thief, Matty is bailed out by Francesca, Anna finds independence from her parents, and Desmond\'s mother convinces Roy to quit drugs. Before the SAT testing begins, the group realizes that, although it will help get them what they want, they would be better off without cheating. Roy grabs the answers and distributes them in the bathroom. After the decision, Matty comments that "this whole thing was for nothing." Kyle replies, "I wouldn\'t say nothing," as he glances at Anna. Matty and Francesca also share a look, as they have presumably started a relationship, too. Each person eventually gets their desired test score without the answers: Kyle\'s dream of becoming an architect is still alive by attending Syracuse University, Desmond ends up going to St. John\'s, Matty becomes an actor, Francesca writes a novel , and Anna decides to travel Europe for awhile before starting college. As for Roy - the narrator of the movie - he earned the highest SAT in the county, and, under Desmond\'s mom\'s guidance, he gets a GED. He then puts his untapped intelligence to use through programming, becoming a successful video game designer.'] ['Stan and Ollie travel to the mountains in order for Ollie to recover from gout. They park their caravan near a deserted cabin recently occupied by a gang of moonshiners who had been ousted by Prohibition authorities; the moonshiners, attempting to hide the evidence, had dumped their brew into the well, which Stan and Ollie now proceed to drink from, thinking that it is healthy mountain water . A motorist couple who have run out of petrol arrive and ask for help. While the irritable and overbearing husband  walks back to his car with Stan\'s spare can of petrol, the man\'s wife , appreciating the boys\' affable and respectful manners as a refreshing relief from her husband\'s crabby belligerence, willingly joins the boys for supper and ladlefuls of the "mountain water". The husband returns with the car to find that the three are all roaring drunk, and his anger at Stan and Ollie triggers a "tit for tat" sequence at the end. It culminates with the wrecking of the caravan, Hall being tarred with molasses and feathered, and with a toilet-plunger stuck to his forehead. Ollie then jumps into the well because his trousers are on fire. The alcohol in the water detonates, causing Ollie\'s explosive ejection, leaving him buried in the ground with his legs flailing in the final scene.'] ['At the "Screen Stars Annual Ball" Norma Shearer has her jewels stolen. The police must find them and return them to her.'] ['When the orchestra leader strides onstage and makes his way to his podium, the audience at the bandshell applauds — and it\'s the last moment of harmony in the film. Of course, Laurel and Hardy establish themselves as the epicenter of the difficulties: somehow, they get out of synch with the other musicians, so when the conductor taps his baton for the band to stand up, The Boys sit down; another tap, and the band sits while The Boys stand up. Up and down, down and up — it takes a look-that-could-kill from the maestro to wilt the two back into their chairs. He gets the music rolling then, and it seems to proceed well: the group plays a passage, then the soloists stand and contribute — a trumpet first, then a trombone, until the clarinetist is called upon for his solo — and the cutaway shows him still sorting through his music charts with his friend, Mr. Hardy. Another up-close-and-personal staredown gets a bleat from Stan\'s woodwind that blows the hat off the maestro and is unmistakably a sour note — even though it\'s a silent picture. Touchingly, Ollie stands and provides the needed solo line from his French horn for his friend. Stan\'s performance is dealt another blow when his clarinet comes all apart in his hands, then a particularly robust riff from the trombonist behind him blows his music from its stand over to the conductor\'s podium and under his feet. Stan plucks the music — the French horn music — from Ollie\'s stand, sending him over to retrieve the sheets from under the maestro\'s stomping foot. When Ollie returns with the charts, he sees that they are for b-flat clarinet, and there is a musical twist on the wrong-hat swap. The kerfuffle over the music causes all the music stands  to tumble over like so many dominoes. Back at their boardinghouse, The Boys settle in for a hearty meal — the pleasure of which is blunted when they find a note from the landlady: "In the excitement of having a job, you have overlooked 14 weeks board bill." Ollie tucks it away for postprandial attention, but then the top falls off the pepper shaker and befouls his soup; he swaps his bowl with Stan\'s, and the salt shaker top falls off and ruins this second bowl. The landlady asks a boy at the table how the concert was, and he says, "It was great — after they was fired," pointing at The Boys. Wordlessly, they rise slowly from the table and are met at the door by the landlady, who is holding the totality of their worldly goods: one clarinet, one French horn — and two derbies. A title card announces: "Re-financing — In business for themselves" and we pick them up on a street corner, instruments in hand. Even without the benefit of a soundtrack, the visuals alone are convincing that they are as sorry a duo as they were cogs in the ensemble: the exaggerated, uncoordinated foot stomping, the attempts to play the first note together, the rapid unraveling of the effort. You do not have to hear them to know how bad they are.  Sadly, they are unaware that their difficulties here are just an overture to those upcoming. First, a policeman comes by and asks if they have a license. "We have no dog," a befuddled Ollie answers — and the resulting bum\'s rush from the officer finds them seeking out a new corner. The new locale doesn\'t ease the musical discord, though, so a friendly drunk offers to serve as conductor, until his zeal with his walking stick raps Stan on the knuckles. The cop\'s return sends them off yet again, and first Stan, then Ollie, fall into manholes. To add incendiary to insult, Ollie gets a blowtorch to the backside by an irate subterranean worker. One last try to earn a living through music: The Boys play a selection directly to a cross-eyed passerby who pauses, listens, digs in his vest pocket as if for a coin — then strides away without contributing when they pass the hats, both of them. It is too much for Ollie: he takes Stan\'s clarinet and breaks it over his knee, which in turn is too much for Stan, who kicks the French horn under a passing steam roller. Ollie picks up his squashed instrument, blows into it, and pronounces it "Flat." The Boys then enter into an atypical extended tit-for-tat routine against one another, escalating from shin-kicking through hanky-tearing, then jacket-ripping, button-popping and hat-stomping. A man emerging from the ABC Restaurant finds himself involved, and the melee quickly widens to some two dozen well-dressed adult male participants. It takes a surreal turn with the de-pantsing first of Hardy by Laurel, then of everyone by his adjacent combatant, until all are displaying their  BVDs — including the policeman. From the swirling maelstrom of boxer shorts, we cut to a solitary king-size gentleman, alone in the frame, with his arms up, his pants gone and his chubby pale legs peeking out from gleaming white shorts: "I\'ve been robbed!" he cries. It\'s instantly clear what happened when we see Stan and Ollie — walking together, finally in synch, in the enormous trousers — tipping their derbies at the audience as they exit the shot.'] ['Young Ellen decides to take a boat journey to Svalbard in northern Norway.

In hiding from him, they line up on a queue that takes them to a recruitment office by mistake and end up joining the army.  No sooner are they getting acclimated with their new army surrounding when they meeting their Drill instructor-sergeant: Hugh Dare, the irate husband/man on the street. Sgt. Dare desperately attempts to teach the Stooges the standard military drill from the manual of arms. He then threatens them during bayonet practice. The Stooges are sent to the front line, where they decide to take a long nap. After learning that Sgt. Dare has been captured by the enemy, they are instructed to detonate a laughing gas shell, which manages to explode on them rather than the enemy due to their pointing the cannon upward. Laughing hysterically, the Stooges are brought to enemy headquarters where Sgt. Dare is being detained. The enemy communicate in pig latin; hopped up by the gas, the Stooges gleefully use their violence in a wild free for all fight against their captors, including an accidental sword thrust to the rear of the sergeant and his retaliatory punch to the enemy captain that makes him fall on the pointed end of his pickelhaube helmet. The Stooges knock out everyone, including all the enemy soldiers and Sgt. Dare. After emerging victorious, several guns fire at them, with shells whizzing past, the Stooges always ducking in laughter or leaning back giggling, each time missing another shell. Finally, the last shot's shell passes between their legs and takes them into the clouds."] ["Vaudeville-era magician Presto DiGiotagione{{ref label}} is famous for a hat trick wherein he pulls his rabbit Alec Azam{{ref label}} out of his top hat. The short begins with an unfed and irritated Alec locked in a cage, unable to reach his carrot. After Presto returns from eating a meal, he begins practicing his act with Alec, revealing that his top hat is magically connected to a wizard's hat kept backstage with Alec, so that when Presto reaches into the top hat, his hand appears out of the wizard's hat, allowing him to grab Alec and pull him out of the top hat. He intends to feed Alec the carrot, but realizes that he is late for the show and rushes off to the stage without doing so, much to Alec's anger. Presto tried to start the performance, but Alec has reached his limit and refuses to cooperate until he is given the carrot. Presto then spends the rest of the show trying to catch Alec through the opening between his top hat and the wizard's hat. Alec cleverly turns the hat's magic against his master into multiple painful and humiliating ways and unsuccessful attempts of magic. Presto's hand is hit by a drawer off stage, his finger is stuck into a mouse trap, and he is hit in the face by an egg . Presto responds by antagonizing Alec, turning the carrot into a flower. Furious, Alec sucks Presto's head into a vacuum kept offstage, which spikes Presto's hair, making his face red and then rips his slacks off. Angered, Presto looks angry at Alec. Alec closes Presto's hand into a drawer backstage, and looks through his sleeve for the carrot. Presto starts running at Alec, but instead is poked in the eye by his own hand. Presto drops his hat, and when he grabs the wizard hat, he accidentally takes of his pants. Furious, Presto wants to attack Alec, but in an act to defend himself, he puts a ladder into the wizard hat, and Presto is hit between the legs by the ladder kept off stage. Trying to get revenge, Presto attempts to hit Alec with the same ladder . Presto antagonizes Alec again, covering the carrot with a cloth before smashing it into a pulp with a piece of the ladder. An extremely angry Alec retaliates by aiming the opening of the wizard's hat towards an electrical socket which Presto's finger goes into, causing him to dance wildly to bluegrass music. The audience interprets these shenanigans as part of the act and applauds with increasing approval. Presto, now very angry, has had enough and chases Alec backstage, catching his foot in a rope that lifts him up to the fly space above the stage when he mistakenly releases the weights holding down some stage props. When his foot comes loose from the rope, he falls, along with a piano and some suspended scenery. Alec, realizing that Presto will be crushed, reluctantly uses the magic hat to save him, earning the audience's wild approval for both himself and Presto. Presto gives Alec the carrot , as well as second billing on the posters advertising the show , and they are rewarded for each show they do, roses for Presto and carrots for Alec."] ["Woody Woodpecker lands in a sideshow at a small-town circus, where his heckling proves too much for magician Buzz Buzzard to handle.

The Indian\'s body shape, along with the glasses he wears, suggest that he is meant to be a parody of Ed Wynn, although the voice does not match. Most of the episode is spent with Bugs getting vengeance by "thinking up some more deviltry for that Apache." At the climactic moment, Bugs, looking at the camera, says "Imagine this guy! Just who does he think he is to be chasin\' me?", the Indian answers, holding Bugs at arrow-point, "Me? Me last Mohican!".

But he ends up stepping into the hen's food bowl and runs away. He briefly disguises himself as a milkmaid while milking the cow and then tries again. As he reaches underneath the hen, he grabs one of the hen's eggs instead of Jerry, which results in the hen clucking at Tom in a mean way. The hen then arranges the eggs with a nearby triangle in the same manner as arranging billiard balls. Tom then sets up a mousetrap tied to a string and puts it underneath the mother hen. Jerry comes out with the trap and he sets the trap with Tom's tail on it. Tom doesn't realise his tail is in the trap for a while and then screams out in pain. Tom then sneaks into the barn inside a butter churner. He sticks the chicken with a fork and searches the nest for Jerry. As the hen lands, he sneaks back inside the churner and sticks the hen again. After the hen lands again, Tom tries to stick the hen a third time. But the hen hides behind the churner and lets out a scream. She moves the churner, grabs the fork and ends up sticking Tom. The hen starts to ride Tom like a horse but she stops when she hears tiny chirps from her nest. Her eggs have hatched. She picks them up from her nest and sends them off to play. Jerry runs away from the nest with a few feathers and he tries to blend in with the other chicks. But one of the chicks mistakes Jerry's tail for a worm.  Mother hen and her chicks then walk in a line past Tom. Jerry sneaks past Tom and he doesn't figure out that Jerry is in disguise. So he gives Tom a swift kick and hitches a ride on the hen's backside. He waves at Tom and Tom realizes his stupidity. Tom then stands by an opening in the barn's wall and sees the shadows of the chickens passing by. He grabs a chick, thinking that it's Jerry, and runs away. When he opens his hands the baby chick yells for his mama, who promptly arrives. Tom smiles and hands back the chick. The mother hen then slams a bucket onto Tom's head. The chicken then cross paths with a family of ducks and Jerry follows the ducks into a pond. He goes underwater and then starts getting chased by Tom again. Jerry again tries to cut Tom's head with the shears but fails. Tom then grabs the shears and starts chasing Jerry with them. Tom chases Jerry near the mother hen who is having a drink of water and Tom cuts off her tail feathers. The hen responds by grabbing Tom, wrapping a towel around his backside and cuts off his fur. Tom is then shown pacing outside the henhouse with bandages on his backside. As he looks in, the mother hen has tied a feather duster to herself and Jerry is resting, using the hen's feathers as a pillow with the rest of the baby chicks."] ['Ziggy  and his faithful dog Fuzz take a job as a street Santa to raise money for the poor.

His ultimate goal is to have the group perform his own theme music in place of Ludwig van Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. After quietly playing his theme on his violin during the symphony, the angered conductor comes over to the group of violinists to inspect their violin bows. The Panther's bow manages to fire a blast of smoke like a gun into the conductor's face, prompting the ejection of the pink feline a second time.  The sly panther manages to sneak back into the Hollywood Bowl, and starts utilizing both a tuba and a trumpet to blast his theme song once again. The conductor becomes even more infuriated, and tries a third time to remove the Panther from the proceedings. Pinky disguises himself against the fancy pedestal of a harp, making himself invisible to the enraged conductor. Thinking he has succeeded in ridding the music hall of the panther, the conductor returns to his podium, unaware that the Panther has substituted his baton with a small rocket. The rocket then shoots into the air and takes the conductor up with it, and then the rocket explodes and drops the conductor far away, allowing the Pink Panther to conduct the orchestra in a rousing rendition of his Pink Panther theme. In the end, Henry Mancini makes a brief cameo, applauding the panther's performance.DePatie-Freleng website"] ["Excitement arrives in the town of Toonerville, when a movie is being shot on location in front of the Scorpion's clubhouse.

The bird then walks off, passing behind a tree. The cat immediately emerges, licking his chops and hiccupping, having obviously eaten the bird.

Producer William Froug saw the film and decided to buy the rights to broadcast it on American television. The transaction cost The Twilight Zone $25,000 &ndash; significantly less than the average of $65,000 they expended on producing their own episodes. However, Froug’s purchase allowed for the film to be aired only twice . Consequently, it is not included on The Twilight Zone’s syndication package . The episode\'s introduction is notable for Rod Serling breaking the fourth wall even more than usual, as he explains how the film was shot overseas and later picked up to air as part of The Twilight Zone. Marc Scott Zicree\'s The Twilight Zone Companion incorrectly states the French film was purchased for $10,000. This mistake has been reprinted in a number of books since the 1984 publication. The Twilight Zone: Unlocking the Door to a Television Classic by Martin Grams correctly verifies the purchase price as $20,000 plus $5,000 additional costs for reediting.

Porky Pig is leading a wagon train to California and he must keep an eye out for the Herculean Native American "Super Chief", Injun Joe. The name is a play on the famous Santa Fe train run of the same name , and reinforced by each character spouting smoke and crying "Woo-woo!" like a steam locomotive, each time they say Injun Joe\'s name.

The mouse slides into an alley and begins to use it as an ice skating rink after discovering its slippery properties. At this point, Tom peeks out from behind two bowling balls and decides to use stealth to catch the mouse. At this point, Jerry runs out of alley and falls back on the regular floor. Jerry gets a good running start to run back into the lane and trips over Tom\'s tail as Tom sits there, doing nothing and waiting for the mouse to discover him. Oblivious, he moves Tom\'s tail out of the way and starts to run until he almost runs into Tom\'s mouth. Knowing who is on top of him, Jerry returns the cat\'s tail to its original position, grooms it, and then speeds under the unsuspecting feline. Tom chases Jerry onto the bowling lane, but he slips when he hits the alley. Jerry seizes the chance to play with the cat, uses a T-stop, and returns to the struggling Tom, who manages to make it to his feet. Jerry slides nonchalantly next to him and blows on Tom\'s hind legs, causing Tom to fall again. Jerry then grabs Tom\'s tail and whips him across the building into an ashtray. The cat comes to his senses and gags and spits out all the ash in the manner of a volcano. Jerry waves at Tom from where the pins are set up as Tom grabs a bowling ball and tries to throw it at the pins. However, Tom cannot throw and he lets go of it in the air, and the ball lands directly on his back. Jerry laughs as Tom then throws the ball like a hammer in the Olympics. This succeeds, and Jerry braces himself against the 1-pin as the impact comes. It only jiggles the pin and mouse as the ball returns the same way it came. Tom throws the ball again and starts bowling the pins down as Jerry hangs on to the 1-pin and jumps it out of the way. By the fourth ball, there is only Jerry\'s pin and the 7 and 10 still remaining and it breaks through the bottom of the pin, leaving the mouse subject to gravity once he realizes the situation. Jerry then hides behind one pin as Tom converts the resulting snakebite split with the fifth ball.  Tom then prepares himself like a bowler for ball 6 by using a towel and powder. He successfully throws the ball at Jerry, who picks up the pin next to him and swings it like a baseball bat. He hits the bowling ball and the pin splits in half. The ball then comes back toward Tom, who backs up like an outfielder all the way to the bar section of the alley, all for the ball to hit him, and the cat falls through the floor. Tom recovers and pokes his head out of the hole to see the ball staring down at him. The pins have been reloaded as Jerry waves at the still-stunned cat. Tom throws his ball at Jerry, but his thumb gets stuck in it and he ends up going down the lane with the ball, making a strike as Jerry hangs on to the pin setter. Then the pin setter covers Tom and shapes him into a bowling pin. Jerry escapes, but Tom then pushes a line of bowling balls toward Jerry in the fashion of train cars. Jerry outruns the balls by hiding underneath the ball-eject lane, and the balls recede into it. Jerry sets out back the other way, but the balls come out again and start heading back to where they came. Tom sees this and opens his mouth ready to eat the mouse when the "train" runs into him. However, Jerry manages to hide in the lead ball, and Tom is choked by that ball and run over by the rest of the "train". Jerry then pops out of his hiding place as Tom is thrown after him by the "train" unseating him. The balls carry Tom up to the ball rack and the last one manages to squeeze him through the arch. Tom runs directly into Jerry\'s ball at the end, and the ball that knocked him through also comes toward him, smacking the cat between the two bowling balls and knocking him silly. Jerry pokes out of his ball, and Tom revives and sees him return into it. The cat sticks his finger into the holes of the bowling balls to dig out the mouse, but Jerry ends up biting him. Jerry flies back into the ball and Tom then blows into the holes of the bowling balls. This causes Jerry to pop out, but only as long as Tom blows. He continues to blow Jerry out until Tom has enough time to catch Jerry in the air before falling back into the ball. However, the ball drops on Tom\'s left foot, causing the cat to clutch it in pain and release the mouse. Tom chases after Jerry, but Jerry stops him and then stomps on the same foot again.  Jerry jumps into another bowling ball, and Tom covers it with a cloth, thinking that he has caught Jerry. However, Jerry pops out of another ball behind Tom, grabs Tom\'s tail, and threads it through the holes of the ball and ties it in a knot. The mouse then stands in front of Tom, who is tying the cloth around the ball he thinks Jerry is in. Tom is having trouble tying the cloth, so Jerry helps him by placing his hand on it. The surprised cat unties the knot, and seeing no mouse, realises his stupidity and chases the fleeing Jerry. However, it becomes a lot harder because of the ball tied to his tail. It smacks Tom in the rear twice as the mouse hides behind a corner. Tom catches Jerry, but the backwards momentum of the ball causes the cat to let go. Jerry runs under a bench and Tom can\'t follow him due to the width and height of the ball. When Tom can no longer move, he turns around and sees the situation before the ball breaks free from the bench and slams into him, sending Tom down the lane, through the pins, through a wall and into a trash can. Jerry then stands over his scorecard and writes that his last frame was a strike, allowing him to have bowled a perfect game.'] ['Victor Frankenstein  is a young boy who creates movies starring his dog, Sparky .

But when Larry shows up, he informs Bob that he never really went there, ending up instead at "Overdone British Literary Adaptations Camp". Bob is dismayed because Larry\'s knowledge of Danish was critical to the scheduled show intended to address a viewer\'s question about self-worth. Larry comes up with an alternate plan though, one based on his experience at the Camp he did attend. The result is a parody of The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.

The movers walk Granny’s things past Sylvester as he is napping on top of the wall surrounding the house. Sylvester suddenly wakes up when the movers parade Tweety in his cage past him, and Tweety says: “I tawt I taw a puddytat!” Immediately, Sylvester starts to pursue Tweety atop the wall, but then crashes into a lamp post and falls off the wall. Sylvester climbs back up as Tweety is carried into the house, while another mover sets Hector’s doghouse down on the ground. Sylvester steps down upon the roof of the doghouse as he comes down from the wall, and when Hector sees him, he likewise says: “I tawt I taw a puddytat!” Hector then bites Sylvester’s tail and chases him back out to the street. Plotting to get past Hector and finagle his way into the house, Sylvester disguises himself as a lamp, putting a shade on his head. After a mover carries him in and sets him on the table next to Tweety’s cage, Tweety plugs Sylvester’s tail into the outlet, giving Sylvester a massive electric jolt. Hector bites Sylvester and also gets zapped, then chases him out of the house and back to the street again. Sylvester then tries posing as one of the movers...and gets Granny’s piano loaded into his arms! Tweety guides Sylvester all the way up the stairs to the top floor and through a doorway, which sends Sylvester plummeting with the piano to the street below, prompting Tweety to remark: “Ooooh, dat wast step was a wuwu!” Making another attempt, Sylvester hides under a bear rug to sneak up on Tweety and climbs up to his cage. Granny, frightened at the sight, thinks the bear had been “playing ’possum for twenty years” and fires several pistol shots at Sylvester  before Hector chases him out again. Finally, Sylvester goes to the costume shop and dresses up full-body as a voluptuous female dog to lure Hector away from the front steps. As the instantly lovestruck Hector approaches, Sylvester is preparing to knock him out with a mallet, but before he does, a dog catcher captures Sylvester in his net and locks him in his truck. Outraged, Sylvester furiously pounds on the window, demanding the dog catcher to let him out. He then removes the rubber dog mask from his costume yelling, “I’m not a dog, I’m a cat! K-A-T!”—a fatal error, as all the dogs in the truck notice immediately and begin to attack him as the truck disappears down the street.

Sylvester alone is alert to the danger from murderous mice that have taken up residence in the hotel. Unlike the previous cartoon, however, the mice are  unseen, except for tiny, malevolent pairs of eyes in dark corners . No matter; Porky checks in with a few small scares for Sylvester. The mice, do what they can to kill and/or scare Porky and Sylvester. As always, Porky does not see the danger until Sylvester has chased the mice away, leaving him holding the bag—or, in one case, the noose the mice have dropped around Porky\'s neck, which the cat has just pushed Porky out of the way of. Porky demands to know why Sylvester shoved him, leading to Sylvester donning the moose head and the noose dropping from it. The moose head begins to follow Porky up the stairs. A shotgun comes out of its mouth and tries to shoot Porky. Sylvester fights with the moose and Porky scolds him. Porky enters vacant room 13 where Sylvester is still watching for any imminent danger. Suddenly, a noose comes from the ceiling and almost strangles Porky. Sylvester grabs a razor and cuts the noose. Porky who felt that sees Sylvester with the noose and the razor asks what he is doing with a rope and that razor. Sylvester sees a mouse with a large kitchen knife. The mouse swoops down and cuts a line of hair on Sylvester\'s back. Porky, humiliated and furious with the shenanigans forces Sylvester to go out. Sylvester sees a ghost but the moonlight reveals that the "ghost" is just the mice standing on each others shoulders under a white sheet. Sylvester runs back inside but Porky only sees another white bed sheet covering a chair. He pulls the sheet off and Sylvester mimes that he saw a ghost.

Failing to answer the other questions required him to "pay the penalty"  These penalties include Porky being crushed by the Rock of Gibraltar, rained upon by Niagara Falls, tied up and blown up with dynamite, pounded with a mallet, threatened by a buzz saw, crushed by a safe, and other forms of abuse, to Daffy\'s amusement.

The cartoon is loaded with puns and pop culture references, even by Warner standards. After this lampoon, Warner never issued another of that genre. The cartoon starts out in the same, pastoral "after midnight at a closed bookstore" fashion of previous versions, to the strains of Moonlight Sonata. The storefront is realistic, suggesting that it was rotoscoped. Initially the cartoon has a serious feel to it. Then, an inebriated "cuckoo bird" pops out of a cuckoo clock to announce the arrival of midnight , the cartoon\'s first lampoon and pun appears, a book cover called "COMPLETE WORKS of Shakespeare". Shakespeare is shown in silhouette while his literally-rendered "works" are clockwork mechanisms, along with old-fashioned "stop" and "go" traffic signals, set to the "ninety years without slumbering, tick-tock, tick-tock" portion of "My Grandfather\'s Clock". Cut to a book titled Young Man with a Horn; a caricature of Harry James breaks loose with a jazz trumpet obbligato similar to James\' "You Made Me Love You", in which he segues into the standard, "It Had to Be You". A striptease is about to begin on the cover of Cherokee Strip. Book covers for The Whistler and The Sea Wolf show their characters shouting and whistling at the off-screen action.  The now-panting Shakespeare silhouette\'s inner workings explode in a shower of gears and clocksprings. The catcalls continue with Henry VIII  also howling like a wolf and then barking like a seal. Referencing a catchphrase of the popular radio program The Aldrich Family, the king\'s "mother" calls out, "Hen-REEEE! Henry the Eighth!" "Coming, Mother!" is the king\'s cracking-voice reply, and he runs to the book cover where Mother waits. As she begins to spank her "naughty boy", a new singing voice and caricature appear, namely that of Frank Sinatra. The gray, blanketed, emaciated character, over-emphasizing Sinatra\'s real-life physique, enters the cartoon on the cover of The Voice in the Wilderness. A large, male orderly pushes the Sinatra character across the screen in a wheelchair. Sinatra begins to croon the lyrics of "It Had to be You" into a ribbon microphone. Now the women take their turn at hysteria. Henry\'s mother, bobby-soxed versions of Little Women, Whistler\'s Mother  and Mother Goose  begin to whistle and catcall , and swoon and faint at the sound of Sinatra\'s voice, each of them uttering the catchphrase "Fraaankie!" before passing out. A full-blown jam session begins, with a lively swing version of "It Had To Be You". Joining Harry James are the Indian on the cover of Drums Along the Mohawk, who morphs into a realistic-looking Gene Krupa ; Benny Goodman ; and a green Tommy Dorsey ([[The Arkansas Traveler . The character on the cover of the book BRASS rubs his Trombone under the besotted nose of W.C. Fields. Annoyed by the revelry, Daffy Duck steps out of the cover of a Looney Tunes & Merrie Melodies comic book , proceeds to go and starts rifiling through a trunk  for clothes. He dons a zoot suit and a curly, blonde wig, as well as what appears to be a set of fake teeth . Just as Gene Krupa plays some notes on the buttons lining the corpulent stomach of Hudson\'s Bay, Daffy shouts for the celebration to "STOP!" and the jam session screeches to a halt. Daffy stands in front of the cover of Danny Boy, and effects Danny Kaye\'s Russian-accented characterization heard in Kaye\'s debut 78 album. Daffy says "POOEY!" to swing music and jazz, and reminisces about his "native willage", "why-o-leens", and "the happy peoples sitting on their balalaikas, playing their samovars" . Daffy starts talking about a girl named "Cucaracha", parodying Lucky Strike cigarette ads: "so round, so firm, so fully packed, so easy on the draw..." Daffy does a wild, short version of "La Cucaracha" in his normal character mode, including his "hoo-hoo" bit. This short segment has a plain background, suggesting it was cartooned separately and inserted tentatively, to be dropped seamlessly in case the censors objected to the somewhat suggestive comments about "Cucaracha". The background changes to a strange one with legible newsprint superimposed on silhouettes of urban buildings; Daffy continues in his fake Russian accent as he sings, Carolina In The Morning  inadvertently teasing the Big Bad Wolf, who at this point is still in the window of "Gran\'Ma\'s House"; Daffy beats a hasty retreat to stage left. Meanwhile, Little Red Riding Hood, based on Margaret O\'Brien, skips past Daffy and toward Gran\'Ma\'s House. Noticing Red, Daffy zooms back and stations himself between her and the house, launching into a wild scat - a reference to Danny Kaye\'s song "Melody in 4F" in his 1944 film debut Up in Arms - to warn her of the wolf, complete with mock chewing on her leg for emphasis. The wolf appears, and Red screams and runs away. The wolf begins to sprinkle salt and pepper on Daffy\'s leg. Daffy halfway notices, turns back to "bite" the now-gone Red, then turns toward the wolf with a startled and outrageous double-take, turning into a giant eyeball  for a couple of seconds. The wolf chases Daffy through Hopalong Cassidy, Uncle Tom\'s Cabin, and is stymied trying to cut down Daffy who is hiding in the Petrified Forest. Meanwhile, the police have been alerted  and the wolf is apprehended by The Long Arm of the Law. The Judge sentences the wolf to Life , as the wolf sings part of the sextette from Donizetti\'s Lucia di Lammermoor - "You can\'t do dis to me! / I\'m a citizen, see?!" The wolf is suddenly bonked over the head with a nightstick, and then makes his Escape and runs through the volumes. Jimmy Durante, incongruously illustrating the cover of So Big, turns toward the wolf, and his huge nose trips the wolf, who goes sliding down Skid Row, nearly falling into Dante\'s Inferno. The wolf scrambles to the top, but the Sinatra caricature reappears, held in the orderly\'s hands as if he were a doll. The Wolf, being in the grandma archetype, swoons at the sound of "Frankie!", just as the female characters did, and skids head first into the inferno. The other book cover characters loudly cheer and dance to a jazz/swing version of "Carolina In The Morning", the Wolf makes one final appearance to shout, "Stop that dancing up there! ... ya sillies!" This last bit is the actual title of a 1944 song by Harry "The Hipster" Gibson, along with a lisping delivery of "sillies" caricaturing Joe Besser. Clampett\'s famous "bee-woop!" vocalization ends the cartoon on a sort of "shaggy dog" note.'] ["The Stooges return home to their shack in the city dump to find it inhabited by a young woman and her crippled younger brother, Jimmy.

They explore and reject several options including watching television , listening to the radio  and playing chess . This is briefly interrupted when the doorbell rings and one character answers it to find a pesky dog  before the other persuades him to enter into a game of shadow puppets. The first character is frustrated by his acquaintance\'s appalling representation of a cow and later his failure to recognise a rather fantastic rabbit . After an amusing outburst from the poor fellow, his annoying partner accuses him of being \'shirty\'. This leads him to explode, furiously crying "I\'m stuck indoors playing \'Guess the misshapen beast\' with someone who clearly wouldn\'t recognise a rabbit if it came to his house for tea, said \'What\'s up Doc?\' and started burrowing into his head! There are blind people with no fingers who are better at shadow puppets than you! No wonder I\'m a tad miffed!" An awkward silence follows this, until the doorbell rings and the first character goes to answer it, and finds the second character\'s \'cow\' shadow puppet, which moos. Despite being disappointed with being wrong about a cow\'s appearance, he simply responds to this with a cheery "Not today, thank you." and closes the door in front of the camera, thus ending the animation.'] ['This film is a narrative journey from Dante\'s own hand, through the worst of the afterlife, Inferno.

Sylvester suddenly hears a howl that scares him and Porky proceeds to point out it is a harmless coyote, forcing to go to sleep outside while Porky himself sleeps in his tent. Suddenly, an alien from the planet Jupiter arrives on Earth, with his mission being to collect some earthlings for an experiment. Sylvester is scared by the alien and tries to warn Porky, but this only makes Porky angry and causing him to boot Sylvester back outside.

Tom now has to hide under the cabinet as Mammy comes directly towards him, and she answers the door to receive a cute female cat to take care of temporarily. Mammy sits her up on the couch as Tom sees her and instantly falls in love. The cat is struck by Cupid\'s arrow and dresses up by smoothing down his hair, curling his whiskers and tail, and spraying himself with cologne. He then proudly walks over to her and she smiles back. He offers her a goldfish and a canary, but she is not hungry for either. Seeing a chance to humiliate Jerry, Tom instead goes over to the filing cabinet to release him. Jerry escapes and runs away, but Tom takes his time looking through a magazine to shake him off his tail before giving chase. Tom catches Jerry by his tail just before he runs through his mousehole, releases him, and sits on the couch. As Jerry runs toward him, Tom holds out his arm for Jerry to climb, and Jerry climbs it and is then caught between the cat\'s fingers.

Since there is no response, Jerry then runs inside a full automatic record player, but Tom turns on the turntable, causing the mouse to go nowhere fast. Tom then presses the button to change records, but forgets he is sitting on one. Jerry flops himself to get off the turntable just before Tom falls onto it and is "played" by the turntable due to the record on his tail. The girl cat now wonders where her beau is and peeks at the developing scene. Jerry, inside needle container in a record player, digs himself out only to see he has been impaled repeatedly with the needles. After shaking them out of him, Jerry avenges himself by causing the records to change again, and it hits Tom\'s head, causing the cat to assume a Zen Buddhist caricature as the table spins.  Happy with himself, Jerry dances to the Oriental music, then changes the record to a Spanish tango, which causes Tom\'s rear to gyrate in time, supplemented by Jerry kicking it. The mouse continues to dance to the music, but accidentally sits on the Stop button, freeing the cat. Tom is eager for revenge of his own and pounces at the mouse, but Jerry takes stock of the situation fast enough to restart the player as Tom jumps through the record passer, causing Tom to be lodged in it. Now, the cat tries to escape the turntable, but is forcibly slapped back onto it by the needle whenever he does, and is then planted directly on the record and smacked by the reader as he makes the revolutions. Jerry then presses the start button to stop Tom and get him running on a record again. Jerry then starts pressing random buttons and waves at the helpless girl cat as records fly at her and then continually break over Tom\'s head, except for one that doesn\'t. Eventually, with help from the needle holding Tom into place, the last record knocks Tom out as it breaks and Tom is thrown through the player as it self-destructs. Jerry then goes over to the mirror, cleans himself up, kisses the girl cat and walks proudly into his mousehole.'] ['This is one of the cartoons that Warner would occasionally produce that featured few or none of its stable of characters, just a series of gags, usually based on outrageous stereotypes and plays on words, as a narrator  describes the action.

The worst of all is the fact that Sissy Frenchfry, someone Bodey considers a loser and a nuisance, holds the position of ultimate authority and respect in the school: Student Body President. Bodey sets his sites on the presidency, aiming to change West Beach forever. What follows is Bodey bribing, seducing, and manipulating his way into a position of popularity and power.

The rabbit then picks up a saw and cuts the tail off the big cat. Oswald returns to the location of his shop, and stucks the tail on the street just in front.

Six New Jersey counties make the decision to extend pension benefits to domestic partners. Don Bennett says that the Ocean County Freeholders are now under increasing pressure from the press and cannot come up with a good reason for their refusal to do likewise. Although the Freeholders attribute their decision to financial reasons, Dane Wells believes that one or two of the board oppose change, and that the other board members are backing them up. He says that John Kelly has said that his personal belief is that the change would violate the sanctity of marriage, but that this is not the official position of the Freeholders.

The two play around on the beach before getting changed into bathing costumes and going into the water. They bob up and down in the water before swimming out of the scene. Once the couple have gone a man sails out in a boat.'] ['The Karnival Kid is broken into two distinct segments. The first segment features Mickey selling hot dogs at a carnival. The second segment is set later that night and features Mickey, accompanied by two cats, in a moonlight serenade. The short opens to the scene of a bustling carnival. After a few initial sight gags, the action quickly focuses on Kat Nipp, a barker at the carnival who is enticing a crowd to see Minnie, "the Shimmy Dancer." Mickey stands nearby, selling hot dogs and heckling Nipp. Nipp briefly gets into a dispute with Mickey over a dancing doll scam. However, Minnie soon notices Mickey and calls him over to order a hot dog. She takes a coin out of her stocking to pay, but Mickey, who is clearly attracted to her, refuses to accept the coin and gives it to her for free. When she bites into the hot dog, it screams and runs away. Mickey catches it and spanks it, concluding the first segment. Much of the humor in this segment comes from the interaction between Mickey and his hot dogs, with the latter tending to act like actual dogs in relation to their owner/trainer. In the second segment, Mickey attempts to draw Minnie\'s attention by playing guitar outside her window. He is joined by two alley cats who noisily sing along. The sound delights Minnie but awakens an irate Kat Nipp, who had been resting in a nearby trailer. Nipp starts throwing things at the three annoyances in an attempt to silence them. The short ends as Mickey is hit with an entire bed and knocked dizzy. Stalling\'s score for The Karnival Kid features two notable themes. During the "Shimmy Dance" sequence, a monkey, performing as a one-man band, plays the Snake Charmer song, the common name for The Streets of Cairo. During the moonlight serenade segment, Mickey and the cats perform a rendition of the barbershop standard Sweet Adeline.'] ['In the center of a monotonous-like subdivision, Sarah and Patrick have been living with their emotions kept isolated between themselves and their son. Patrick seems to be cold and harsh by ignoring Sarah\'s existence, and the affection Patrick once had for her has all but disappeared. It comes to the point that his sexual urges are manifested in his actions toward his son, Joey. Sarah is left in bewilderment when she hears the discussion of his husband and son at nighttime; she even asks herself, "What have I done?" When Sarah has run out of options for trying to bring back the spark in their marriage, she tries to do the unthinkable.'] ["Throughout the first two parts almost everything we see is through the eye of the camera , although there are occasional moments when we see O's perception. In the third part we get much more of O’s perception of the room and its contents. In order to distinguish between the two perceptions, objects seen by O were shot through a lens-gauze, blurring his perception while E's perception was shot without gauze or filters, keeping the images sharp.  The film opens onto a rippled image that fills the entire screen. Without colour it is hard at first to tell what we’re looking at but it is alive. As it moves we realise it is an extreme close-up of an eyelid; it fills the entire screen. The eye opens, slowly, closes, opens again, blinks and then fades into a different rippled image, still somewhat organic but changed, still.”When the rushes of the first frenetic day’s outdoor filming were viewed, it was clear that it had been an almost total disaster … Yet the budget did not allow for the scene to be reshot … Hours were spent getting the exact close-up that they required of Buster Keaton’s ‘creased, reptilian’ eye to replace the abandoned outdoor scene with the extras.” – Knowlson, J., Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett , pp 523,524 As the camera begins to pan right and up and we realise it is a wall; we are outside a building . It is summer though it is hard to tell. The camera’s movement is not smooth. It is as if it is looking for something. Eventually it loses interest and pans left and down back to the wall. Suddenly the camera  shifts violently to the left. A man is hurrying along the wall from left to right. He pauses, hugging the wall and E gets a chance to focus on him. He has on a long dark overcoat, the collar of which is turned up and his hat is pulled down over his face. He is hanging onto a briefcase with his left hand whilst trying to shield the exposed side of his face with the other. He realises he’s been seen and cowers against the wall; E quickly shifts behind him. No longer conscious of being observed, O starts off again, knocking over a trestle, stumbling over a railway sleeper, anything to stay as close as possible to the wall. He charges into a man and woman, knocking the man’s hat off. E looks from the man’s face to the woman’s and back again. The man has a moustache and is wearing a pince-nez. They have been consulting a newspaper which the woman keeps hold of. They both look appalled at what has happened. E moves back to a long shot and watches O barge through and on his way. The man replaces his hat, takes off his pince-nez and looks after the fleeing figure. The couple look at each other and the man “opens his mouth to vituperate”Beckett, S., Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett , p 165 but the woman shushes him, uttering the only sound in the whole play. Together they turn to stare directly at E and, as they do, an open-mouthed expression takes over their faces; they can’t bear to look at what they’ve seen and turn their faces away. The action shifts back to O just as he reaches and turns a corner. He heads off down the street until he realises he is at the right doorway. He enters.  The camera cuts to the vestibule. We are directly behind O. The stairs lead up on the left, but O veers right and pauses, pulling himself together. He takes his pulse and E moves in. As soon as he becomes aware of E's presence he rushes down a couple of steps and cowers beside the wall until the camera retreats a little. When it does he reverses back up to street-level and then begins up the stairs. A frail old woman is coming down. The camera gives us a brief close-up. “She carries a tray of flowers slung from her neck by a strap. She descends slowly and with fumbling feet.”Beckett, S., Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett , p 166 O backs up and hurries down the steps to the right again where he sits down on a step and presses his face against the balusters. He glances up briefly to see where she is then hides his head from view. As the woman reaches the bottom of the stairs she looks straight into the lens. The expression on her face changes to the one of wide-eyed horror that we saw displayed on the faces of the man and woman outside. She closes her eyes and collapses. E checks on where the man had been, but O has made his escape. We just catch his coat tails flying up the stairs. E chases after him and finds him at the top of the first flight. He looks around to see if there is anyone about. Satisfied he turns left and, not without some difficulty, opens the door to a room and enters. E slips in unnoticed as O locks the door behind him and then takes his pulse once more.  We find ourselves in a “small barely furnished room.Beckett’s notes identify this as the man’s mother’s room. This recalls Molloy’s return to his mother’s room/womb/tomb to die. – Ackerley, C. J. and Gontarski, S. E.,  The Faber Companion to Samuel Beckett, , pp 195,383 The man – and the camera following him from behind – survey its contents: a dog and a cat share a basket, a caged parrot and a goldfish in its bowl sit atop a small table; the walls are bare apart from a mirror and an unframed picture of “the face of God the Father”Beckett, S., Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett , p 167. The actual photograph was “suggested to him by Avigdor Arikha [and] was a reproduction of a Sumerian head of God Abu in the Museum in Baghdad. – Knowlson, J., Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett , p 523 pinned to the wall; there is a couch with a pillow, some blankets and a rug on it, a rocking chairThe rocking-chair is a common Beckettian prop, appearing in the opening chapter of Murphy, Rockaby, Molloy  and the abandoned Mime de rêveur, A. with a “curiously carved headrest”Beckett, S., Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett , p 167 and there is a window with a tattered roller blind with full-length net curtains to either side.  Systematically O takes each object or creature in the room and disables its ability to ‘see’ him: he closes the blind and pulls the net curtains across, he covers the mirror with the rug, the cat and dog (“a shy and uncooperative, little Chihuahua”Knowlson, J., Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett  are – with some difficulty – ejected from the room and the picture is torn up. Although stated simply the mechanics needed to execute these tasks are laborious, e.g. as he passes the window he hides behind the blanket which he holds in front of himself to cover the mirror and he carries the cat and dog facing away from him as he tries to put them out the door. After all the above he goes to sit in the chair. There are two holes in the headrest that suggest eyes.In his manuscript notes Beckett had not envisioned these ‘eye’ holes but had written “Make chair back memorable” and foresaw an “upright back, intersecting wooden bars or lozenges”. – Notes for Film , quoted in Knowlson, J., Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett , p 802 n 54 He ignores them and sits. O takes the folder from his case and goes to open it but there are “two eyelets, well proportioned”;Knowlson, J., Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett , p 524 he turns the folder through 90° but he’s disturbed by the parrot’s eye and has to get up and cover the cage with his coat. : Keaton asked Beckett what O was wearing underneath. “I hadn't thought of that,” the author admitted and then proposed, “the same coat,” which appealed to both men.<ref namePeriod in rocking chairInvestment proper . As O begins to doze off, E begins to move round to his left. Suddenly O realises he is being watched and turns his head violently to the right. E moves behind him again. He resumes rocking and dozes off. This time E whirls round to the right, passing the window, the mirror, the birdcage and fishbowl and finally stops in front of the space on the wall where the picture was. E turns around and, for the first time, we are face-to-face with O, asleep in his rocking chair. All of a sudden he wakes and stares straight into the camera lens. He looks very much like the man in the seventh photograph only much older. He still has the eye patch. He half starts from the chair then stiffens. Gradually the horrified look we have seen before on the couple and the old woman’s faces appears on his. He is looking at himself but not the scruffy, wearish man we have been watching, the man before him, standing with a big nail beside his head, has a look of “acute intentness”Beckett, S., Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett , p 169 on his face. O slumps back into the chair and starts rocking. He closes his eye and the expression fades. He covers his face with his hands briefly and then looks again. This time we see the face of E in close-up, just the eyes. O covers his eyes again, bows his head. The rocking dies down and then stops. The screen goes black. We then see the opening image of the eye, which is frozen, and the credits are presented over it. Once finished, the eye closes and the film is over."] ['The main protagonist, a hungry dog is humming the theme song of Tom and Jerry. He stops and gets a bone and a newspaper from the trash can. He then sits and he uses his newspaper as his napkin. He then reads it and was horrified. The newspaper says: "LAST DAY FOR DOG LICENSES! DOGS WITHOUT TAGS TO BE LOCKED UP IN CITY POUND.". He sees the city pound truck is driving past through the street, but the driver sees him. Panicking, he disguises himself to be a lamp. He escapes from the pound and hides from a gate; he looks at the hole, where he sees a sleeping Spike with his license. He happily digs a hole in order to get inside, but looks around, he doesn\'t know that Spike is in his head. He crawls to Spike\'s dog house. He tip toes to Spike and tries to remove his license, but no use. Spike wakes up and the dog hides. Spike yawns and goes back to sleep. The dog frowned and sees Tyke, going to sleep. He took Tyke\'s license and wears it. He begins to walk away and sees Spike, who is angry. The dog says Spike to be quiet. Yet, he shows Spike the news. He reads it and chases the dog, who escapes. He sees Tyke, who is barking. The dog catcher caught him, but, he lets Tyke to wear his own license and runs off. He gets his license back from the dog, but, the catcher pursues him. But, Tyke\'s license is taken by the dog. They are taking turns in attempt to get it. But, when the dog escapes, Spike hits him with some trash can cover and the dog grabs the stick and throws it and Spike catches it and realizes he\'s been tricked. The dog goes to the gate and Spike grabs him, the dog fools him again and orders Spike to roll himself to the manhole. Under, Spike grabs the dog and sees Tyke is now caught. Spike tells the catcher that he will sacrifice for his son and is ready to enter the truck. The dog then cries about the drama and gives the license back and drives the truck and speeds away. The catcher is chasing the truck while Spike and Tyke remain happy.'] ['When an incendiary bomb strikes his house during the Blitz, Hay fusses so ineptly with his extinguishing equipment that the bomb burns through the floor - and obligingly falls into a bucket of water in the basement.

A cop chases them to a construction site, where they escape by riding an elevator to the top floor of a unfinished building. Atop the girders, 20 stories in the air, they finally switch trousers, contend with a crab that has found its way into Ollie's pants, and manage to nearly fall to their death a few dozen times."] ["  Introduction: Like all Sam Sheepdog and Ralph Wolf shorts, this one revolves around Ralph Wolf trying to steal the sheep which Sam Sheepdog is guarding. 1. Ralph's first plan is to sneak under a sheep and carry it off, wearing it as a disguise. When Ralph is caught by Sam he attempts to push the sheep away and act innocent, but Sam punches him in the nose, turning his nose into an accordion. 2. As in all three earlier episodes, Ralph devises a plan that involves tunnelling under the field and digging very small holes through the surface. This time, he creates the hole a safe distance away and surveys the area with a periscope. After spotting a sheep, he attempts to capture it with a lasso, but accidentally snags Sam, who punches him in the head. This time, Ralph walks away with his entire body turned into an accordion. 3. Ralph's third plan is to build a simple suspension bridge out of firecrackers and lure Sam to the other side. When Sam passes, Ralph grabs a sheep, lights the firecrackers, and runs across the bridge, ensuring that Sam has no way to return. However, Sam uses his uncanny ability to appear at the other end of the bridge, where he prompts Ralph to hand over the sheep. Ralph begins running toward the burning end of the bridge  and extinguishes the firecracker. However, Sam lit the other end of the bridge, and Ralph's bridge disappears beneath him. 4. Ralph then attempts to place a makeshift teeter totter under Sam and jump on the other end from a great height. However, because of Sam's weight, the board merely acts as a springboard, tossing Ralph into Sam's arms. Sam places Ralph on one end of the teeter totter and slams the other end down as hard as he can, sending Ralph flying through the air. 5. Next, Ralph wheels a giant, lit cannon, up a hill behind Sam. As Ralph runs away, giddy, the cannon begins to roll down after him. As Ralph notices this, he runs as fast as he can, until he reaches the edge of a cliff, which has a very small cliff immediately below it. Ralph climbs onto the cliff and turtles. The cannon stops on the edge of the cliff, but has enough momentum to flip the cannon over so it's pointing straight down at Ralph. Ralph, curious if he's safe, stands up, only to discover that he's inside the cannon just before the cannon is about to fire. 6. In Ralph's final attempt, he sneaks up behind Sam and attaches each end of a very large elastic band to rocks on either side of Sam to create an over-sized slingshot. As Ralph pulls the band back, the rocks loosen and fire past him, anchoring themselves into opposing sides of a chasm, and slinging Ralph through the chasm. On the other side of the chasm, Ralph grabs hold of a tree and holds on for dear life, but the elasticity of the rubber band slings the two rocks into Ralph, sending Ralph, the two rocks, and a piece of the tree flying, while the rubber band is still wrapped around the rest of the tree. Ralph manages to free himself from the two rocks and the piece of tree, only to run into a cliff face and be crushed by the items. As Ralph crawls out from under the wreck, the rest of the tree slings into Ralph. Finally, the punch clock whistle blows and Ralph and Sam walk home. Ralph has two black eyes, an arm in a sling, and is stumbling. Sam reassuringly suggests that Ralph take the next day off, and that Sam can handle both jobs."] ["The gang are running their own taxi service, and come across Ernie and Farina delivering laundry to J.

Realizing that the task may not be easy, Hubie comes up with several ways to chase Claude out, all of which are designed to drive him crazy, having Bertie do each of the tricks. First, Hubie lowers Bertie down the chimney on a fishing line. At the bottom of the chimney, Bertie grabs a piece of wood, smacks Claude in the head with it, and is then quickly yanked back up the chimney. When Claude just goes back to sleep, unable to figure out what happens, Bertie is lowered again, pumping air into Claude Cat. When Bertie is yanked back up the chimney and the pump is released, Claude ends up flying all over the living room, hitting all of the walls and ceiling before landing hard on the pillow on which he was resting. Claude then takes the bottle of catnip he had hidden in an overhead lamp and tosses it out the window then he mutters. With the logs removed from the fireplace, Hubie lowers Bertie and a dog  in a doghouse down the chimney. While the dog is sleeping, Bertie pulls out the dog\'s lower lip such that it snaps back on him, but not before Bertie is pulled back up the chimney. Seeing only Claude, the dog viciously beats up Claude before returning to the doghouse, with the doghouse then yanked up the chimney. Completely nerve-wracked as a result of the beating, Claude then runs to the bathroom to take a dose of nerve tonic. While Claude is in the bathroom, Bertie then inserts a lit firecracker into Claude\'s pillow, which blows up not after he returns to it. Claude then nervously gulps down the remainder of the nerve tonic. Next, Bertie returns down the chimney and runs a piece of string throughout the house, out of it into a water catch drain, down a ladder, and then back into the house, with the other end of the string attached to a rock on top of the chimney. Once Bertie ties the end of the string to Claude\'s tail, Hubie tosses the rock down the other side of the chimney, which sends Claude flying throughout the house, out of it and back into it, and eventually slamming him into a trash can lid, which begins to drive Claude crazy. Claude then reads "Psychology of Dreams" by Sigmund Fried for advice on dealing with what Claude thinks are bad dreams. When Claude falls asleep, Bertie places earmuffs over his ears, while Hubie and Bertie work on nailing everything that would be in front of Claude that was on the floor in the living room to the ceiling, and painting the ceiling like the floor and vice versa. When Claude wakes up, he sees this and thinks he is on the ceiling  and jumps up to what he thinks is the floor . Claude is surprised when he grabs a bottle of nerve tonic, only to open it and see it "rise" to the floor. Claude then becomes confused when he enters into the kitchen, where everything is still right-side up. Further driving Claude mad is when he looks out one window where an illusion is given to make Claude think he is upside down, and then looks out another to make him think he is sideways, and then out a third to make him believe that the house is under water. Finally broken, Claude runs, screaming, from the house and hiding into a nearby tree. Having accomplished their mission, Hubie and Bertie return down the fireplace, and roast cheese over an open fire as the cartoon fades out.'] ["Wally had finished filling little Marianne Edwards' favorite doll with sawdust.

Both men defeat the Japanese and Popeye\'s fist reaches so far that he knocks out Hirohito.

The cartoon concludes with Bluto finally signing up for his draft, while the imprisoned Japanese all spell his name: "B-L-U-T-O", in reference to the commercial for Jell-o from that time.'] ['A wealthy old scrooge disowns his son after he decides to marry a poor woman.

The opening shot/title card is of the mouse in question, Abner, staring up at the city skyscrapers, with the sign directing him to Podunk facing the opposite way. He receives a telegram  from his cousin, Monty, telling him to "Stop being a hick" and come live with him in the city. Without specifying the location of Abner or Monty, the film sets out to contrast the lifestyles of the archetypal country and city inhabitants. Abner is shown walking along a railroad towards the city, and when he arrives, the differences between the two become clear. Abner is wearing overalls and is portrayed as bumbling and oblivious to the dangers of the city, whilst Monty sports a top-hat and is acutely aware of the problems they face . Monty leads Abner to a meal that the human residents of the household have set out. The two mice begin by dining on cheese, but Abner lacks any sense of etiquette, and soon begins gorging himself on celery, cream, and mustard, the latter of which generates a reaction to the excessive heat. Cooling himself with Champagne, Abner finds himself partial to the taste, and becomes drunk, provoking the disdain of Monty. Abner begins seeing in double vision, and creates more noise by bringing down a pile of bread . Abner then assesses his reflection  in a block of jelly . As he walks away, he slips on a piece of butter lying on a saucer. The saucer, spinning and flying across the table, catches Monty on the way, and breaks several pieces of dishware too. Monty is infuriated, and as the pair are now on the floor, he attempts to find a secluded spot, safe from the sleeping pet cat. The inebriated Abner, with a great sense of bravado, kicks the cat\'s behind, whilst his cousin rushes back to his home . The cat bares its teeth at Abner, which only leads him to inspect the inside of its mouth, thus bringing Abner back to his senses. He is then chased by the cat, first receiving an electric shock by jumping inside a socket , and then ending up on the city street when he jumps out of the window. Abner is faced with escaping from the footsteps of the people, a bike, an electric tram, and other vehicles. He finds himself at the city limits again, and flees back to his home town.'] ['The cartoon follows the story of a B-29 Bomber named John, who is married to Mary, a similar but unnamed plane. John can\'t seem to find work at any airport because they\'re looking for jets. He then finds out he and Mary are going to have a kid, so needing to find work, he heads off to reenlist in the Air Force, but finds even they won\'t take him back in, as they\'re looking for jets as well, which further angers him. Finally Junior arrives and John is very pleased...until he realizes he\'s a jet also, making him lose his mind . When reading the paper the next day, John sees the ad for a jet contest held by the United States Government where the winner gets a huge contract. Plenty fed up with jets, he goes to enter the contest as well to try to show them up. Realizing what risk he\'s putting himself in, Mary goes after him with Junior in tow. En route to the contest, John meets a B-29 general who smokes Douglas MacArthur\'s trademark corncob pipe and has Bataan written amidst his five stars. When John asks him, the general declines to enter the contest and states, parodying MacArthur\'s farewell address to the U.S. Congress, that "older planes never fly, they just fade away," before literally fading away. At the contest, John lines up at the starting line with the rest of the jets. Mary catches up and tries in vain to reason with him, but gets shoved away by him. While this was happening, Junior gets out of the baby buggy and get in the fuselage of John, and by the time Mary realizes it it\'s too late. At the green flag, the jets all but disappear while John sputters badly to take off and run the race. Within no time, his propellers had had enough and detach from his body, sending him into a nose dive for Earth. Junior realizes what\'s happening and manages to get out in time to grab him by the tail and save him. When John realized he hadn\'t crashed, he looks back and sees Junior holding his tail and flying him along. After happily praising him for saving him, they then kick it into high gear and run the race, tearing past the other contestants, and are shown flying around the world, going by certain landmarks with funny things happening.  They easily win the race and the government contract...for Junior. John\'s joy is soon sort of crushed when he is told they need ten-thousand more just like him, realizing he and Mary have some procreating to do.'] ["While heading out to work, a university hospital nurse named Deanna is tased and raped in her apartment elevator by a hooded man wearing a surgical mask and medical gloves. The next day, the traumatized Deanna subdues a burglar who breaks into her apartment using the rapist's abandoned stun gun. Deanna, convinced the intruder is the same man who raped her, ties the burglar up, strips him down to nothing but his underwear and balaclava, and takes some of his blood. At work, Deanna steals urine samples, makes plans to go out with a friend and co-worker named Leanna on Thursday, and asks her boss, Doctor Tyson, to compare the burglar's blood to a swab of semen she had collected after being raped. Deanna tells Doctor Tyson that a friend was raped, and that the blood belongs to her ex-boyfriend, who she suspects was her assailant. Back at home, Deanna tortures the burglar by covering him in the urine samples, burning him with a blow torch, and jabbing him with syringes. When Thursday arrives, Deanna goes out to a nightclub with Leanne, and hours later returns to her building severely intoxicated. While stumbling up to her apartment, Deanna bumps into a neighbor and acquaintance named Trevor, who she seduces and has sex with. A relationship develops between the two, as Deanna becomes further unhinged, and begins suffering from nightmares. She also continues to torture the burglar, dressing in fetish-wear attire for the occasions, and attaining an almost sexual gratification from the man's suffering.

The narrator explains how the Roaring 20\'s was a time of jazz, new fashion trends , dance parties, and mobster violence. The scene then cuts to a pair of gangster cars shooting guns at each other . One man, witnessing the gangster battles, hurries over to the nearest telephone booth and orders the operator to connect him to the police, but the dim witted operator takes so long to make the connection that the gangsters\' gunfire shoots the telephone booth and man in half, to which the operator says "Sorry! You\'ve been disconnected." Over in Washington D.C., Bugs Bunny  is assigned by his chief to infiltrate the gangster underworld in Chicago. As Bugs takes a taxi out to Chicago, he discovers he\'s fallen into a trap set by Rocky and Mugsy. At the hideout, Rocky and Mugsy have tied up Bugs and put his feet in a bucket of water, making it seem like he has a cold, but Mugsy pours in some cement. Both men then throw Bugs into Lake Michigan in the dark of the night, but Bugs manages to use a pipe as a snorkel and hop out of the lake. The next night, the gangsters decide to throw a party to celebrate Rocky\'s birthday and the  death of Bugs. Rocky\'s guests include Jack "Legs" Rhinstone , "Baby Face Half" Nelson , "Pizza Puss" Lasagna , "Pistol Nose" Pringle , and "Teeth" Malloy . Mugsy announces Rocky\'s entertainment just as Bugs pops out of the cake, disguised as a flapper. During the entertainment, Mugsy, distracted by Bugs\' disguise, nudges Rocky so he falls over, making Rocky punch him up the jaw. Just as Rocky comes up to Bugs to tell him he loves him, Bugs kicks Rocky up the jaw, making him drop his guns. The third kick has Rocky so deep under his hat that he has to feel the floor for his guns and fire aimlessly. Once Bugs flees, Rocky sees he\'s been set up and orders all the gangsters in attendance to capture Bugs, but they fall to the floor dead . Just as Mugsy comments on Rocky making a boo-boo, Bugs comes in, disguised as a police inspector, and books Rocky for murder. Determined not to be booked, Rocky whips out a revolver. Bugs then whips out a carrot, which Rocky and Mugsy find funny, until the carrot end opens up and blasts them. When Bugs tries again, the carrot is empty, to which Bugs comments "That\'s the trouble with carrots! They\'re only good once!" Rocky then retaliates with real gunfire and he and Mugsy chase Bugs across town into the ACME factory. Unable to see in the dark, Rocky orders Mugsy to turn on the light, but once the light is on, Rocky see that Bugs has a gun aimed at him. He orders Mugsy to turn off the light, but Bugs blasts him before the lights go out. Rocky then orders Mugsy to switch places so that Mugsy will blast Bugs. After the places are switched and Rocky turns on the light, Mugsy fires, only to discover Bugs isn\'t there. By the time they turn around and see where Bugs is, Bugs blasts Rocky again and turns out the light. Rocky and Mugsy then chase Bugs up a set of stairs into, what we think to be, a storeroom. Mugsy slams the door on Rocky, which prompts him to sock him up the jaw again. Bugs then escapes, locks the door, and runs down the stairs. A light then goes on revealing that the three characters are in the cereal unit of the ACME Factory. Bugs then throws a switch, which send Rocky and Mugsy into a mixer and has them mixed about like "a merry go round at the amusement park." Bugs then throws another switch which puts them in the popper. When the cereals come out on the conveyor belts, Rocky has been placed into a "six pack" box and Mugsy has been placed into a "king sized" box . The next day, with Rocky and Mugsy apprehended, Bugs takes them to the State Prison. Rocky and Mugsy are then sentenced by the court to spend twenty years of hard labor. As they\'re hammering away on the rocks, we see in the final shot that Bugs is joining them in the sentence, as the narrator explains that Bugs had lost the keys to the handcuffs.'] ['Filmed in a typical forties style, it tells a story of a cursed jewel, which has been stolen; and eventually everyone who tries to possess it gets killed'] ['Little Lacy , a big music fan, discovers a great but expensive guitar in a music shop.

He explains that there are only six members of the band, since the former lead singer, only named as "Allard", quit last week, but that their new manager, Casey Donovan could help make Suburban Legends a household name. Cut to Casey, who is trying to get the attention of Gavin Hilshire, the head of the fictitious Sharp Records\' talent development, to Suburban Legends. Gavin agrees to see the band next week. This doesn\'t seem to be an issue for Casey, who finds it much more important to design a new button. Casey goes to SL\'s headquarters in Santa Ana to make sure the band is allowing auditions for new members. The audition is revealed to be a game of Twister, except with the colors replaced with condiments, such as relish and Nutella. Some of the members are shown having minor conflicts with Mike, who uses Phil\'s lucky rag to clean up the mess from the game of Twister, and tries to convince Luis to stop living in the past by watching old concert performances. Phil clearly has a crush on Ellie, the band\'s webmaster. Derek believes that Phil isn\'t mature enough to start dating, and Phil denies having a crush on her. Casey announces to the band that Gavin Hilshire is coming to see the band next week, to which Brian Robertson objects to, as the band has no lead singer. Brian leaves in anger, and a discouraged Brian Klemm laments that not even "Hilary can lift [his] spirits." Vince Walker arrives, in a suit, as soon as possible after getting a text message from Brian Klemm reading that he was injured in a debilitating shark attack, but finds that Brian meant to send it to a girl who wasn\'t calling him back, but accidentally sent it to the band instead. Derek explains that Vince was the band\'s trumpet player two years ago and was Brian Klemm\'s best friend before he quit to further his education. Vince is on his way to an interview with an advertising firm, and is confused as to why the documentary film crew is following him.

Brian Robertson returns to his old job as an employee at Boba Joe\'s, where he claims he is often recognized by fans. A customer with a Suburban Legends shirt walks into the business, and recognizes him as the guy who makes great "mango tangos". Brian tries to get the fan to notice who he is by saying he likes his shirt, to which the fan awkwardly replies he likes Brian\'s as well, obviously not recognizing who he is. Brian shows interest in wanting to pursue a college education, explaining he asked Vince to recommend him to an admissions person at his school, to which Vince, trying to get the band\'s attention, replies with a text message proudly exclaiming that he\'s getting circumcised and to meet at the "usual place" to celebrate. The band meets up at a Mexican restaurant, where Luis works, dressed as a giant taco. Vince tells the band he wants to rejoin the band as the lead singer, while Brian Klemm shows disappointment that there is not going to be a circumcision. The band unanimously votes to let Vince rejoin the band, and that the band will remain together if they get signed to Sharp Records. Vince\'s girlfriend, Trisha, is angered at Vince for joining the band. Trisha is angered that he\'ll only be able to work part-time and for three hours, is under the impression that Vince would rather be in a band than have a penis.

Vince gets a call from the ad agency, who still wants to hire him despite his poor interview. He doesn\'t want to turn down the job, or he\'ll let his girlfriend down, but he also doesn\'t want to let the band down by taking the job. The band is waiting at the venue for Vince, who hasn\'t shown up. Luckily Vince arrives with a case of Martinelli\'s, ready to play the show. The band plays "Hey DJ" to an energetic crowd, with who appears to be Gavin Hilshire in the audience. The band runs backstage, cheering, happy to see Gavin in the crowd. Gavin walks in, congratulates the band, and asks Brian Robertson to go talk with him. The band celebrates, and thanks Casey, who apologizes to the band that Gavin didn\'t show up. Mikey tells her he\'s talking to Brian, who runs in, agitated and disturbed. It turns out the man they thought was Gavin was actually "Sam Freek", a wanted band stalker. The band, however, agrees to stay together and invite Gavin to the next show. Vince decides to pass on the job and permanently stay with Suburban Legends.'] ['In the film, Kanye West plays himself drunk at a nightclub embarrassing himself and his friends while being belligerent.

He also tries to flirt with many of the women there, who are at first starstruck, but then quickly repulsed by his drunken behavior and lewd advances. West embarrasses himself further when he tries to hit on a woman who is there with her boyfriend. He later runs into Fonzworth Bentley, who he has a brief conversation with until another drunk man comes up to West and mistakes him for Lil Wayne. After Bentley corrects the man, the man continues interrupting the conversation while attempting to talk to West until Bentley grabs the man and a fight breaks out. West simply walks away.

He then wanders into an empty side room where he begins to feel depressed, but a beautiful woman in a leopard print dress appears. She comforts him and tells him "It\'s OK" while he cries on her shoulder. They begin to have sex on a sofa but he passes out on top of her. When West wakes up a short time later, he finds himself with his pants down, lying on a sofa covered with leopard print pillows — he was hallucinating. Startled and nauseous, he rushes to the bathroom and vomits what appear to be rose petals. West finds a bowie knife in the bathroom and cuts into his stomach, spilling a torrent of petals from his stomach. He pushes the knife in deeper and, with his hands, digs out of himself a small rodent-like creature, named in the credits as "Henry". When Kanye realizes it is connected to him by an umbilical cord, he cuts the cord with the knife. He then places the creature on a sink counter in front of him and hands it a miniature version of the bowie knife. The creature grabs the tiny knife and eyes it apprehensively before shaking its head at West, who slowly nods his head in response. West watches as the creature commits suicide, falls over, and slowly dies while gasping for air.

Neither cat sees the other as they both climb the pole to the nest. Sylvester peers over Tweety’s nest as Tweety sweeps the dust in Sylvester’s face, prompting Tweety to remark: “Ooooh! I tawt I taw a puddytat!” Ditto with Sam, and Tweety says, “I tawt I taw anudda puddytat!” Both cats grab the nest simultaneously and rush down the pole. A tussle ensues with the two felines attempting to knock each other out and playing tug-of-war until Sylvester calls time out, convincing Sam that Tweety is too small to fight over. After debating which one should put Tweety back up on the pole, they agree to put him back there together, which they do. However, it immediately becomes apparent that they still do not trust each other, as they get into a prolonged goodbye and just stand and stare at each other before finally walking away. Sylvester then sneaks up on Tweety hiding under a garbage can, but Sam has the same idea and beats him to the bird, and after both come down from the pole, Sylvester pounds Sam’s can with a mallet. Sam, embarrassed at being caught in the act, tries to save face by explaining that he was “just seeing if he was OK, y’know”. Sylvester yells “Put it back!” and Sam does so, retorting that to not do so would be “unethical”. Tweety then nails a stretch of barbed wire around the pole . Sam, catnapping in his box, then hears Sylvester shouting “Ow! Ooh! Ow!” and stomps over to the pole as Sylvester picks up his torn fur. Seeing Sam’s dirty look, Sylvester exclaims: “Aaaaaaaah, shaddap!” As Sylvester, patched up with tape, is resting in his box, he hears a loud “Boing...boing...boing”. Surely enough, it’s Sam, bouncing on a trampoline in another effort to catch Tweety. Sylvester cuts the trampoline with a pair of scissors and Sam hits the ground with a loud thud, nearly knocking Tweety off his perch. There is a continuity error in that the barbed wire in this and subsequent scenes no longer appears near the top of the pole, but only near the base; the portion just under Tweety's nest is bare of wire. Sam then sneaks out again and looks in Sylvester’s window to find him gone, then looks up to discover Sylvester walking on the wire overhead with an umbrella. Sam cuts the wire with a pair of scissors, sending Sylvester crashing through two windows in a building nearby. Sylvester then closes his now bare-wire umbrella as he descends to the ground, and Sam giggles gleefully. Next, Sylvester dons a Batman costume and soars through the air in an attempt to swoop in on Tweety, but again Sam has thought along the same lines. The two bang heads in mid-air and both plummet back to earth, landing in the garbage dump. Sylvester paces the floor trying to think of what to do next, then peeks out the door to see Sam tiptoeing his way over. Sylvester places a coonskin cap in his box and covers it with a blanket, and when Sam sees it he “knocks him out” with a club. Sam then sneaks over to the pole, not realizing that Sylvester is following right behind him. Sam has a balloon on a string held down by a rock already set. He ties the string around his waist , pushes the rock away to release the balloon, and grabs Tweety on the way up, but Sylvester slaps his paw, and again Sam hands him the “just seeing if he was OK” alibi as the two continue to float upward. Sylvester then stabs the balloon with a pin  and the two plunge back to the ground together in a deadly drop, to which Tweety responds: “Y’know, I never reawized just being a wittle bird could be so compwicated.”"] ['In a closed drugstore at midnight, the characters from all of the books and magazines are coming to life.

Tom is moving so fast, he runs into the wall and turns into a four-legged stool. Tom attempts to cut off a 4×4 area of the wall with Jerry\'s mouse hole in it in order to reach the mouse, but instead, the rest of the wall falls—on him. Then Jerry is being chased by Tom in another direction, and suddenly a second Jerry zooms past. Tom is puzzled as six more Jerry\'s zoom past, and faces the direction they are coming from, angry. A ninth Jerry comes from the other direction, and pulls back Tom\'s eyelids. Tom then chases Jerry outside into the air. Jerry breaks off before falling into space, but Tom fails. He sees the streets 50 stories below and grabs onto the drapes again, which brings him back inside but wraps him up with the drapes. Tom and Jerry then both run into free-fall. Jerry grabs a question mark and catches a pipe. Tom grabs onto an exclamation point and then twists it into a hook shape when he sees Jerry safe, but too late—he slams into the ground shortly thereafter.

Next, Jerry retreats into a second rain gutter, but Tom lassos him using a fish hook, and gives Jerry a taste of his own medicine. To get revenge, as Tom is laughing, Jerry dreams up some knives and throws them at Tom. Tom runs to the end of the sidewalk and narrowly avoids all knives. Tom then becomes stuck in the down pipe of the second rain gutter, with his head and front legs at the bottom and his tail and hind legs at the top, while trying to chase Jerry through it. Jerry suggests using the air horn to "scare" Tom\'s hind legs and tail down the pipe so Tom can be free. After this, the two shake hands, and the chase then recommences. As Tom chases Jerry around a corner Tom\'s midsection is now several meters long and he makes train noises.'] ['The gang tries to clean off their clothes after being splattered with mud accidentally by a passing motorist.

He gets his suit caught and is just about to dive into the ocean, but he snaps back and through the house door. Tom then runs back out toward the ocean, but dives in just as the water recedes and lands amid a bunch of garbage. Tom paddles through the "water", thinking he is swimming, and then walks across the beach knocking out cans from his suit. He stares at Toodles reading a book and wearing sunglasses, but is looking the wrong direction to avoid running into a trash can. The trash can converts into a slot machine, which turns up three lemons, sending Tom out of the can directly into her lap. He winks his eyebrows, and despite her obvious displeasure, eats her hot dog and drinks her soda. Tom reclines in her lap, pleased with his efforts , and a tomato and a banana peel proceed to land on him. Tom looks in the picnic basket as more food is thrown out of it and sees Jerry eating salami from some sandwiches, and then picking up an egg. Tom threatens to slap the mouse with a flyswatter, but Jerry throws two eggs and two olives into Tom\'s eyes. Tom picks up Jerry on a piece of celery, and the mouse takes bites out of the celery and continues through the cat\'s hand. Tom yelps in pain, and Jerry runs away near some rocks. Tom tries to grab him away, but only succeeds in pulling out a crab, which grabs the cat\'s whiskers and pinches them off, leaving Tom to suffer from the recoil of his nose. Tom tries to run away, but the crab grabs his tail and snaps at it with its claw, turning it into a set of linked figures and doubling the pain. Tom chases after Jerry in retaliation, and Jerry signals for Tom to stop the chase in a beach umbrella, tripping the switch to leave the cat stuck inside. When Jerry encounters the crab himself after a short run away, he leads it on a chase that ends in Tom\'s bathing suit. It pinches Tom\'s backside and he yelps in pain. He jumps and the top of the umbrella gets stuck in the sand and the crab makes a flap in the back of Tom\'s bathing suit in front of Tom\'s Anus in a tin-opener fashion, so when the crab escapes the umbrella, Tom is left stuck in the air with his bum showing off.  Jerry then grabs a bottle of soda out of the basket, and while lugging it around bumps himself on Tom\'s shin. Tom opens the bottle and slams the bottlecap on Jerry\'s head, who is now unable to see and eventually gropes himself towards the crab. Feeling the crab\'s claw, he uses it to remove the bottlecap, and now that it has recovered from the surprise, the crab then attempts to catch Jerry in its claw. The mouse escapes being caught and travels back to where Tom and Toodles are sharing sandwiches in order to disturb this situation. Jerry sneaks a shell into the sandwich, causing Tom to shatter his teeth when he bites into it. Tom realises what has happened and turns the situation around by chuckling, then swallowing the shell and revealing his broken teeth, as if to say "Look at this!" Meanwhile, Tom is spooning sugar into a cup of coffee, and Jerry replaces the bowl of sugar with a bucket of sand, adding an entire shovel of sand for good measure. Tom gets a mouthful of sand and gags and spits everywhere, and Jerry then fills the bucket with seawater and "gratefully" gives it to the cat. The raging cat snatches the bucket and drinks it, but since it\'s salty, Tom spits the entire bucket out and as his misfortune would have it, into Toodles\' face, effectively ending their short tryst . In revenge, Tom catches Jerry with the bucket, leaving a bucket-sized sand castle behind, then cuts it down with a small shovel. Seeing nothing, Tom digs into the sand and is buried by Jerry. The mouse pads down the sand and draws back the shovel, hitting Tom in the face with it when the cat emerges. Jerry hides in the picnic basket and Tom grabs a banana out of it, but Jerry has a piece of the banana on top of his head and tosses it into Tom\'s mouth. Tom wonders what happened to the rest of the banana, then spotting the mouse\'s trickery. Jerry again holds up a hand as if to say "Stop!" and closes the beach umbrella the second time. The mouse pops out of the umbrella and, unfortunately, gets stuck in the soda bottle seen earlier. Tom grabs the bottle, victorious, and shakes it, shooting the mouse into the ocean. Jerry pulls off a clam shell, then grabs seaweed and draws a face on a piece of wood on the shore. From behind the figurine, Jerry screams "HELP!" in a hoarse, high voice and slaps the water, as if the figurine is a drowning victim. Tom comes to the "rescue" and throws himself onto the figurine, then followed by a brief tidal wave, leaving an irate Tom with a large bump on his head after the tide recedes. The cat sees Jerry smiling and chases the mouse, and Jerry responds by releasing the air out of an inflatable beach horse . As it hurtles towards the cat, Tom opens his mouth in fright and thus swallows it, sending Tom on a wild ride and out of his bathing suit. Tom flies everywhere on the beach, provoking Jerry to hide as the cat speeds across the sand, and then flies into the air and falls all the way into the sand, busting open a pool. Water from the sea promptly fills up the hole, and Tom emerges riding the horse...only to find that Jerry is sailing away with the picnic basket using Tom\'s bathing suit as a sail, accompanied by the tune of Aloha Oe.'] [' The Stooges are bellhops at Hotel Snazzy Plaza, and pound each other in order to get some face time with an attractive woman .

Spike grabs Tom and scolds him that if Tyke isn't clean at all, the feline will be in trouble with the law. Tom quickly rushes off with the muddy pup and returns almost instantly with Tyke cleaned up. Tom grudgingly agrees to look after the pup and ensure his cleanliness until Spike returns, Jerry of course being ready to sabotage this. As Tom sits down on the same wooden platform that Tyke is lying on, one of the wooden planks catapults Tyke into the air, and Tom narrowly saves Tyke from falling into the same muddy puddle. Tom overhears Jerry's laughter and chases after him. Jerry quickly stops the cat, and challenges him to a game of tic-tac-toe on Tyke's back. Tom wins and resumes chasing Jerry, before suddenly realizing what he's done, and promptly returns to Tyke to rub off his pencil marks. Jerry hurls a tomato at Tom, but Tom quickly ducks so that it avoids him. Realizing that it will hit Tyke instead he yelps with fear and Tom rushes back and stands directly in front of the pup so that the tomato does hit him after all. The chase resumes until Tyke ends up with a jar of ink spilled on him. Tom panics after seeing Tyke covered in ink and attempts to rub the ink off but fails.

Horrified, Tom grabs a hose so that he can wash the paint off, but Jerry connects the other end of the hosepipe to a large container of tar. Out of the hosepipe comes thick, black, sticky tar. Tom sees that Spike is approaching, and decides he had better act quickly. Tom spots a pillow hanging on a washing line, and stuffs Tyke into it and takes him out, which leaves Tyke covered in feathers. He then places a red glove on Tyke's head and a clothes peg on his mouth, so that Tyke crudely resembles a chicken of sorts. Spike is surprisingly fooled and walks off. However, Tyke removes the peg from his mouth and bites Tom's tail. Tom screams in pain and alerts Spike, causing him to turn and investigate. Tom rushes off and hides in the laundry room, putting Tyke inside a washing machine. Tom however is too late to do anything; just as he is adding soap flakes, Spike stops him and takes Tyke out of the washing machine. Catching on to what had happened to Tyke, an angry Spike pours the box of soap flakes over Tom's head and shoves a soap bar in his mouth before he shoves Tom in the washing machine and slams the door on him. Now Tom ends up taking a shower around the washing machine as Spike and Tyke look on. Both of them are joined by Jerry, who waves at the cat as the cartoon closes."] ['The film is set up as a series of humorous tricks on the audience, with constant doubling, and in which things are rarely what they at first seem to be. It opens with Keaton attending a variety show. In this first sequence, Keaton plays beside him and remarks, "This fellow Keaton seems to be the whole show." This was a gibe at one of Keaton\'s contemporaries, Thomas Ince, who credited himself generously in his film productions.The theater and cinema of Buster Keaton By Robert Knopf, page 27 In interviews with Kevin Brownlow{{cite book}}, Keaton claims he gave the director\'s credit to Cline mainly because he did not want to appear too Ince-like himself: "Having kidded things like that, I hesitated to put my own name on as a director and writer."

The second half of the film features Keaton\'s character falling for a girl who happens to be a twin. He has difficulty telling the twin who likes him from the one who does not. An uncredited Virginia Fox plays one of the twins. Edward F.

Memories are not recalled in neat chronological order; instead, they are recalled by the association of one thing with another, which means that any attempt to put memory on film cannot be told like a conventional narrative. The film is thus made up of a series of related sequences whose scenes are interspersed between each other. One of the primary themes involves war, with particular emphasis on the enormous losses the Soviet Union suffered on the Eastern Front during World War II. Several recurring characters and their interactions make up a large part of the film, such as the poet, the little girl and the bull, the little boy and the crows, the dancers and the soldiers, and especially the little grey wolf .

Occasionally, he entertains the local children with scary magic tricks. One of the children tells his mother, who alerts the Mayor . He in turns organizes the townspeople to go to the Maestro\'s mansion and force him out of town. Some of them show reluctance to do so, but are pressured into joining the Mayor on his crusade. On a stormy night they go to the Maestro\'s mansion  holding flaming torches. When they arrive at the mansion, it is guarded by a large gate. They peer in through the gate, and by the haunting look of the mansion, have second thoughts about entering. The children assure the parents that the Maestro has done nothing wrong, and ask that they leave him alone. But the mayor remarks, "He\'s a weirdo. There\'s no place in this town for weirdos." The front gate opens, frightening the townspeople, who make their way to the front door, which also opens by itself. The inside of the mansion appears to them even creepier than the outside, and the parents re-assure their children  "there\'s no such thing as ghosts". They make their way into the house, and once they are all inside, the front door slams shut and locks itself. Two more large doors swing open revealing a large, darkened dance hall. Hesitantly, the townspeople make their way to the dance hall, where they are greeted by Maestro himself, who makes a scary yet comical entrance. The Mayor angrily confronts him, calling him "strange", "weird", and a "freak", and telling him that he\'s not welcome in their town. Maestro defends himself, and in response the Mayor threatens "Are you going to leave, or am I going to have to hurt you?" . To this Maestro replies, "You are trying to scare me. I guess I have no choice; I guess I have to scare you." He then makes a series of funny faces, which the mayor calls "ridiculous" and "not funny". In a change of tone, Maestro asks, "Is this scary?" and pulls his face sideways. Then he continues to stretch his face more by pulling his face down and stretches his mouth, and ultimately pulls off his face to reveal his skull and laughing maniacally. The frightened townspeople run for the doors, which Maestro shuts with his magical powers, after he smashes his skull with his fists, revealing his normal head. One man with glasses and black hair starts to cry after the doors have been shut. Maestro then reminds the mayor he\'s not alone, and introduces his "family" of ghouls who, along with Maestro, perform extended dance routines to 2 Bad and Is It Scary  which alternately impresses and scares the townspeople. During this sequence, Maestro\'s acts include ripping his clothes off to reveal a skeletal body; possessing the mayor and making him dance (including the [[moonwalk ; and transforming the mayor into an evil, horrific dragon while remarking, "Who\'s scary now? Who\'s the freak now? Freaky boy! Freak, circus freak. Who\'s scary?" After Maestro\'s performance ends, he asks, "Do you still want me to go?". While the townspeople respond "no", the mayor says "Yes...yes!". Maestro quietly agrees by saying, "Fine...I\'ll go." He falls, and after smashing his hands and face into the floor, his face and body violently start to crumble into dust on the floor, which is then blown away by the wind. The townspeople are saddened by this, and somewhat sorry to see him go. The mayor however thinks he has come out victorious and heads for the doors saying, "I showed that freak." When he opens them he finds a monstrous-looking Maestro-demon head which says "HELLO" and terrifies him, and he runs away scared . The townspeople then turn back to the now open front doors to see the Maestro standing there, laughing. He asks if they all had a good time, and the townspeople realize they did. They figure he isn\'t so bad after all and make peace with him. The story ends with one of the children asking with a vicious look on his face, "Is this scary?"; he grips his lower face, and the camera moves to a long shot of the mansion while terrified screams are heard.

As he ponders on his thoughts, he considers the idea of holding an Olympic Games-style sports event on the railway line. The rest of the film shows his imagined idea of what would happen, with children being split into four competitive teams to take part in different activities often carried out by young people trespassing on the railway. Three "games" are held, in which the children are challenged to break through the fence surrounding the railway line, play "chicken" with the trains and throw things at passing trains. Each time we see the tragic consequences of these activities, such as one scene where a driver\'s face is shredded by broken glass after a child throws a brick through the train window. The final task is for the children to run through a tunnel, but after they enter, we see a train approaching. Only four children cross the end of the tunnel, each of them injured terribly. One boy who crosses the finish line collapses as the overhead speaker announces the final results.

An inquisitive girl named {{Nihongo}}  chances upon Cenco at school when it is transformed into a bicycle. After Tetsu arrives to retrieve the bicycle, Yuki inadvertently causes Cenco to transform back into its normally large form by poking it in the eye.

The following day, Shū takes Yuki hostage to force Tetsu to come, and places her on a ledge of a tall building. After Tetsu arrives, Shū attacks from afar and manages to cut off one of Cenco's arms. To repair the arm, Cenco removes one of Tetsu's arms, which incapacitates him momentarily. Shū arrives with a much larger creature and Cenco takes Yuki within its body where Tetsu already is.

Susanna", except that instead of 1849, the cartoon is set during World War II, with the implication that Elmer hopes to donate the gold to the war effort: "Oh, Susanna, don\'t you cwy for me, I\'m gonna get me wots of gold, "V for Victowy!", not to mention a "Buy US Savings Bonds and Stamps" sign shown early into the short. Bugs Bunny appears during the second verse while wearing a cow skull and says "Uh, hi neighbor!" and Elmer replies by saying "Oh, hewwo." and Bugs joins in and finishes it with Elmer, singing in harmony, until singing "Good evening, friends!" and goes underground without the cow skull and Elmer checks the skull to find Bugs but he\'s gone, and Elmer becomes suspicious and tells the audience "Hey, there\'s something awfuwwy scwewy going on awound here." and continues investigating the hole until Bugs appears from behind, munching on his carrot, and asking "Eh, what\'s up Doc?" then Elmer, after telling bugs "Well, one of the stwangest things I-", runs from Bugs after being scared by a "Boo!" and Bugs tells the audience that Elmer is a "smart boy" and Elmer returns with an angry look on his face and Bugs runs while screaming. After that Elmer tells the audience "Hey, that was that scwewy wabbit. Oh well". From that point on, in a role change from the usual, Bugs pesters Elmer without apparent provocation, as he did in Wabbit Twouble, from burying Elmer in the hole he was digging to cutting off Elmer\'s suspenders and revealing the girdle he\'s wearing: "Don\'t waugh. I\'ll bet pwenty of you men wear one of these." Instead of fleeing, this time Elmer turns toward revenge, especially when he observes that Bugs has a gold-filled tooth: "Wabbit, I\'m came hewe for gold, and I\'m gonna get it!". As Bugs tries to reason with the enraged Elmer, a furious fight ensues, and Elmer comes up the apparent "winner", holding up a gold tooth, saying, "Euweka! Gold at wast! Heh-heh-heh-heh!" Elmer grins and laughs his usual laugh, and at the same time Bugs mocks Elmer with the same words, dropped-"r" and laugh, revealing that his tooth is intact and that Elmer is holding his own knocked-out gold tooth. So now it turns out that Bugs is the actual winner. So Elmer and Bugs both win: Elmer gets gold and Bugs gets to keep his gold tooth.'] ['Teenage Marianne and her little sister live with their alcoholic mother.

Coyote, apparently famished, wads up a bunch of mud to make a lookalike chicken. He roasts it in an adobe oven, then sits down to "eat" it, with less than perfect results . So he makes a second fixture - a trash can - and throws the "chicken" in it, proving he is indeed Famishius Fantasticus. The Road Runner  bowls everything over, starting the chase. Wile E. takes a straight-line shortcut instead of the road to catch up. Before Wile E. can come close, however, the Road Runner sets the road on fire with his blinding speed, causing Wile E. to burn his feet. He stomps out the fire on his paws, but finds his tail is also burning. Wile E., thinking fast, witches for water to cool his tail off. The Coyote rages at the camera, but nothing can be done except plan the next scheme. 1. Wile E. uses his frequent idea: swing from a high place armed with a javelin, looking to spear the Road Runner. This time, he simply plows into the ground as the Road Runner calmly passes on the right. 2. The Coyote stuffs a gun on a spring into a ground compartment and locks it with a safety lock, hoping to shoot his enemy, but due to the excessive spring force, the gun does a 180 and ends up on the opposite side of the Coyote, upside down, but pointed in his face. Wile E. can only plug the barrel with a finger before getting blasted in the face. Then, the gun returns to the hole in the ground, pulling its owner with it. 3. Wile E. attaches himself to a tree catapult to throw himself towards a passing Road Runner, but instead he bounces himself on the ground and suffers repeating back and forth faceplants as the tree continually stretches to either side. 4. To block the Road Runner, the Coyote attaches a bunch of maces to a string and pole, and unwinds the string when he hears the bird approaching. It\'s an effective obstacle, and would have stopped the Road Runner except that the pole lifts itself out of the ground and drops on the hiding Coyote before the Road Runner passes. Wile E. is battered and tied up by the end of the fracas. 5. This time, the Coyote uses deception. He posts a detour and bridges a crevasse with a ladder that he has sabotaged with a cut in the structure, which will make it collapse if passed over. He hears the Road Runner, but doesn\'t see him, and he looks up to see the Road Runner safely perched on top of a high cliff, watching his every move. The angry Coyote uses his own broken ladder to climb up to the top, with predictably disastrous results. Wile E. falls into the canyon, grabs onto the second section of the ladder to alleviate the fall, and he continues into the ground and through each rung on the way down. 6. Now, Wile E. loads a circle of explosives into the center of a tire, and rolls the tire down a hill to meet the Road Runner. Unfortunately, the explosives stay behind and blow up their user. 7. The Coyote is loaded into a massive missile to chase the Road Runner, but when he sets it off, instead of launching the missile, he only launches himself out of it and through a rock face. He emerges from the resulting hole, blackened. 8. The final gag in this cartoon involves a pack of rocks from on high, ready to fall on the Road Runner when the trap door opens. But when Wile E. opens the trap door, no rocks fall because they\'re too densely packed. So, the Coyote first runs to the top and stomps on them , then procures a long, thin stick and uses it like an ice pick to force them out while standing under them. Pebbles, then stones, then rocks fall. Wile E. finally comes to his senses and raises a sign: "IN HEAVEN\'S NAME - WHAT AM I DOING?" Too late; Wile E. raises an umbrella to prepare for the resulting impact of huge rocks, and after the impact, a long lump forms on the Coyote\'s head with a white flag making the lump look like a flagpole. The flag reads "THE END" while it waves in the wind, accompanied by the song: "Taps". The End.'] ['In the beginning, there are a lot of bulls, romping around together and butting their heads. There was only one bull who wasn\'t doing that, and that was Ferdinand. All he wanted to do was go under a shady tree and smell the flowers all day.

He replied that all he wanted to do was to sit and smell the flowers. Luckily, his mother was very understanding. Over the years, Ferdinand grew and grew until he was as big as the tree. The other bulls wanted to accomplish one goal in life: to be in the bullfights in Madrid, Spain, but not Ferdinand. Then one day, five strange looking men were here to see the bulls. When the bulls noticed them, they fought as rough as possible, hoping that they would get picked, but not Ferdinand who went back to smell the flowers. Just as Ferdinand was sitting, he accidentally sat on a bumblebee. That made him go crazy and on a rampage, knocking the other bulls out and crashed into a tree, making it fall down. The five men cheered as they took Ferdinand to Madrid. There was a lot of excitement when the day of the bull fight came. On posters, they called him Ferdinand the Fierce. At the ring came out picadors and the matador who was being cheered on. When he was bowing, a woman in the audience gave him a bouquet of flowers which landed in his hand. Then the moment came where Ferdinand came out. He was wondering what was he doing there. The picadors were scared and hid, but the matador was scared stiff as Ferdinand noticed the bouquet of flowers. He was coming as the matador dropped the bouquet of flowers as Ferdinand smelled the flowers. The matador was angry that he wasn\'t charging at him. Then he was so angry that he cried because he didn\'t do anything and ripped his shirt. Ferdinand noticed that he had a flower tattoo with the word "Daisy" at the bottom. Ferdinand licked the tattoo as he kept on crying. Eventually, he was dragged out of the arena smelling the flowers and was taken back home. Then he went back under the tree and just smelled the flowers.'] ['Emotionally uprooted after the recent death of her husband, Esther Kern  is trying to return to normal life after completing her shiva—a weeklong period of family mourning mandated in the Jewish religion.Wilson, Ken.

Ralph does not work with Sam in this one, unlike later shorts.  1. Ralph\'s first plan is to trick Sam into going home early, by turning the time on the punch clock forward and setting the whistle off. Sam is initially tricked into thinking that the whistle indicated quitting time, punches out, and heads home. However, he quickly notices on the clock of a church steeple that it\'s 9:00 with its bells chiming and hurries back to see Ralph carrying a comically large pile of sheep. Sam Sheepdog suddenly appears behind a tree and breaks a tree branch over Ralph\'s head, driving Ralph into the ground . 2. Ralph\'s second attempt involves disguising himself as a bush. After stealing a sheep and starting to run away, he runs past Sam, who himself is disguised as a tree and starts to follow Ralph. Sam hits Ralph on the head with a branch, leaving Ralph very confused and with a large lump on his head. After attempting to run further, this occurs once more, and Ralph is left with two lumps on his head. Ralph then gives up and carries the sheep back to the field as Sam impatiently taps his foot . 3. For Ralph\'s third attempt, he reads a book of Greek myths which explains that Pan would "lull shepherds to sleep with the music of his pipes and then steal the sheep." Disguising himself as Pan, Ralph attempts to lull Sam to sleep with a flute, but Sam merely punches Ralph in the face and Ralph stumbles away and continues to play his song, out of tune. 4. Ralph\'s fourth attempt involves tunnelling under the field and pulling each sheep down through very small holes. This is mostly successful, until Ralph unwittingly pulls Sam underground and gets punched in the face. Ralph politely returns all the sheep and refills his tunnel. 5. In Ralph\'s next attempt, he places an Acme product behind Sam, labelled "One Acme wild-cat - Handle with care". Ralph carefully opens the box with a rope from a distance behind another hill, but the wildcat simply runs in circles towards Ralph, maims him and scratches him. 6. Ralph\'s sixth attempt is to swing on a rope over the field and snatch a sheep. Unfortunately, he unwittingly snatches Sam out of the flock. After realizing this, he leaves Sam at the bottom of the rope and climbs to the branch that the rope is tied to and saws the end of the branch off. After seemingly sending Sam crashing to the ground, Sam appears on further down the branch and saws it off at that point, sending Ralph falling. After Ralph seemingly hits the ground, he appears at the start of the branch. This gag continues until Sam is on the end of a cliff and Ralph uses a pick axe to detach the edge of the cliff and send Sam falling. The cartoon then disobeys gravity and leaves Sam\'s piece of earth floating in the air, as the rest of the cliff which Ralph is standing on falls down. 7. Ralph\'s next, seventh, and seemingly final attempt is to snatch a sheep which is drinking from edge of a lake. He uses a hollow rush to swim through the lake unnoticed. Sam notices the rush sticking out of the water and drops a stick of dynamite into it. Damaged by a small underwater explosion like "tsunami", Ralph surfaces and then sinks like a ship. 8. At the end of the short, Sam walks toward the punch clock as his replacement George Sheepdog punches in and greets him. Sam hits him over the head with a plank, and the viewers see that George is really Ralph in a disguise. As Sam begins spanking Ralph with the club, the REAL George Sheepdog shows up and takes over for him, who continues spanking Ralph.'] ["Anthony the Great's devotions in a cave are disrupted by the sudden appearance of a young maiden who he banishes and returns to his prayer book.

At that point, Missie May feels ashamed and embarrassed by throwing all of the happiness away for something that seemed too good to be true. A few weeks after this event, Missie may finds out that she is pregnant and Joe is not concerned whether the baby is his or not. Fortunately at the end of the story, the baby is born, and it is indeed Joe\'s after being convinced by his mother.

For the most part, Craig is persistently hostile towards Anthony. His mother spends time preparing unappetizing meals that are supposed to be healthy, such as homemade tofu squares, fish heads, and spring garden loaf.

There, civilization was far advanced, and it brought forth a race of supermen, whose mental and physical powers were developed to the absolute peak of human perfection. But there came a day when giant quakes threatened to destroy Krypton forever. One of the planet\'s leading scientists, sensing the approach of doom, placed his infant son in a small rocket ship and sent it hurtling in the direction of Earth, just as Krypton exploded. The rocket sped through star-studded space, landing safely on Earth with its precious burden: Krypton\'s sole survivor. A passing motorist found the uninjured child and took it to an orphanage. As the years went by and the child grew to maturity, he found himself possessed of amazing physical powers. Faster than a speeding bullet, more powerful than a locomotive, able to leap tall buildings in a single bound, the infant of Krypton is now the Man of Steel: SUPERMAN! To best be in a position to use his powers in a never-ending battle for truth and justice, Superman has assumed the disguise of Clark Kent, mild-mannered reporter for a great metropolitan newspaper." The story cuts to the Daily Planet building, where editor Perry White reveals to his two best field reporters Clark Kent and Lois Lane that an anonymous figure has been mailing death threats to the Planet, should he not be paid in one million dollars to stop his rampage. About the only clue given is the alias The Mad Scientist . White assigns Kent to handle the story, but Lois, portrayed here as a strong-willed woman, insists that she investigate as well, much to the supposed chagrin of Kent. Lois takes off in a private plane to an undisclosed location up at the mountain, where the main villain\'s secluded lair/laboratory is located. He is preparing to fire his futuristic weapon , until his pet bird spots her aircraft and alerts him. Upon her arrival, Lois introduces herself as a Journalist, but finds herself kidnapped, bound, and gagged, as the scientist boasts to her about the success of his plan, and then demonstrates the beam weapon by aiming it at a bridge and destroying it. While listening to the radio, Clark and the other journalists learn of the coming disaster by the military, who warns everyone to stay inside. Instinctively, Clark steps into a storage room and changes into Superman before flying away. The Mad Scientist then has the beam weapon weaken the foundations of the Daily Planet skyscraper, causing it to tip over. Fortunately, Superman arrives in time and prevents the structure from crashing into neighboring buildings or falling to the ground, successfully restoring the skyscraper to its upright orientation. Superman then pushes the death ray away from the base of the skyscraper, but shortly afterward gets struck down as the scientist turns up the weapon\'s power to its full force. Superman remains determined to fight it and soon perseveres against the beam by punching it repeatedly, gradually pounding the beam back to its source. Seeing that the beam has been overpowered, the horrified Mad Scientist increases power, but Superman uses that against him by twisting the weapon into a knot, preventing the beam energy from escaping, and the buildup of pressure causes the machine to overheat and explode. As the scientist\'s lab disintegrates with the weapon\'s demise, Superman arrives to rescue Lois who has been left there, while also capturing the scientist as he attempts to escape, flying them to safety. The scientist is jailed. The scene dissolves back to the Daily Planet building, where Clark Kent and Lois report back to Perry White. She has gotten a scoop on the story of the Mad Scientist, who is now in prison, and Perry commends her on doing it. Seeing she hasn\'t suspected a thing, Clark looks at the camera, winks, and nods to the audience, and the story ends.'] ["Antoine and Colette catches up with Antoine Doinel as a solitary 17-year-old who works at Phillips manufacturing LPs to support himself.

The dogs angrily expel Tom and the cat hides behind a tree. Jerry, however, is sitting on Spike\'s back, and he taunts Tom. Tom notices a fake dog with a head attached near a pet shop. Realizing he must disguise himself in order to reach Jerry, Tom sneaks off and steals the head. He now walks and crawls like a dog until he reaches a lamppost. He puts the head to the side so if dogs see him, they\'ll think it\'s a dog, and peeks at the dog pound. Seeing it\'s all clear, Tom sneaks in through the bars, but loses the head in the process. He attempts to pull it out when Spike notices him. Tom puts himself back under the head and barks. Convinced that the dog is new to the dogpound, Spike walks away. Tom successfully frees the head and runs to the center of the dog pound to keep a lookout. Jerry sneaks up behind him and imitates barking. Tom is startled out of his wits and has dug through some of the wall when he figures out it\'s Jerry. Jerry continues imitating a dog and then runs away. Tom chases after him and looks under various dogs to find the mouse, and then spots him in a bone-hat. Tom bolts after the mouse and Jerry hides. Convinced that the end of the dog bone nearby is Jerry in disguise, Tom grabs it and is met by an angry Spike. As Spike chomps down, Tom causes Spike to swallow his bone and flees to underneath a St. Bernard. The big dog goes to sleep and Tom pops out from under the dog - but without the dog head. Tom digs back under the St. Bernard, waking it up. Tom is hanging from the collar without the dog head and if anyone notices him, he\'s doomed. Fortunately, the St. Bernard notices nothing.

As the chase resumes, Jerry holds back, trips Tom, and gains the dog head for himself. Spike comes around the corner and briefly sees Tom\'s real head, but Tom hides it fast. Jerry leaves and Tom, apparently with no head at all, waves and follows after him. Thinking he\'s seen a headless dog, Spike emits a terrified shriek like a woman. Tom waddles after his "head", but fails to spot the pole in his way and he bumps into it, returning to normal. Seeing dog ears like the ones on the dog head in a nearby barrel, Tom grabs them and is met with an angry yellow dog. Tom ties up his mouth with his own collar and panickedly runs away. Tom sees Jerry/head follow the path close to him and prepares to seize him; unfortunately, Spike is also coming around the corner. Tom grabs Spike and tries to fit him over his head. When he can\'t move after a few steps, Tom realizes something is up and sees the dog chomping at him. Tom hides behind a wall and soon spots Jerry/head. In his path, though, is a long Dachshund dog akin to a train stop. The dog apparently has two heads....until Jerry reveals himself and sticks his tongue out at Tom only to run into the dog\'s house. Jerry dashes off and Tom traps him underneath the head, but soon realizes that\'s his means of disguise and sticks it over his head just as Spike arrives. Jerry raises the head and turns the head in an effort to expose Tom until Spike lifts the head himself, whereupon Tom covers all of himself with the head and waddles off. Tom lifts the head and whacks himself in an effort to flatten Jerry, but only causes a bump on his head. Because of this, Tom can no longer hide himself when Spike comes around, and finally sees through Tom\'s disguise. Jerry holds up a note stating "YES STUPID IT\'S A CAT". Spike lets out an angry massive buffalo roar and the jig is up. Tom panics and digs a hole, but Spike digs him up with his large jaws.

He is successful in this attempt, and walks down the country road, thinking that his adventure was just a dream...until he hears a farmer calling his donkey "Merlin".'] ['The film follows the preparation behind the service, as well as focusing on one particular journey. The \'star\' of the film is the Gresley A4 60017 Silver Fox, although the film makes a point of featuring many railway employees, for example the maintenance men, the driver and fireman and the station master at Waverley Station "who has a very high sense of occasion". The train completes its journey in its timetabled 6hrs 30mins. It is still highly regarded for its well-filmed sequences by cinematographer Billy Williams showing the operation of the East Coast main line and the Gresley A4 as it was in mainline use, for example the water scoop and corridor tender, although the whimsical verse commentary dates the work considerably.The Railway magazine, Volume 149, 2003. p.30 The film also offers a social record of the different hierarchies existing within the railway, as well as the fashion and people in the 1950s, albeit in a romanticised portrayal.Elizabethan Express at Moving History.

When his mother, father and grandmother arrive at the police station to retrieve him, conflicts in Jim\'s family situation are introduced. His parents are often fighting; his father  often tries to defend Jim, but Jim\'s mother always wins the arguments. Jim feels betrayed both by this fighting and his father\'s lack of moral strength, causing feelings of unrest and displacement. This shows up later in the film when he repeatedly asks his father, "What do you do when you have to be a man?" While trying to conform with fellow students at the school, he becomes involved in a dispute with a local bully named Buzz Gunderson . While he tries to deal with Buzz, he becomes friends with a 15-year-old boy, John, nicknamed Plato , who was also at the police station the night of the opening scene for shooting puppies.

Judy and Jim go to an abandoned mansion; Plato finds them there . There they act out a "fantasy family," with Jim as father, Judy as mother and Plato as child. The thugs soon discover them, and Plato brandishes his mother\'s gun, shooting one of the boys, and shooting at Jim and a police officer, in a clearly unstable state.

As explained in the introductory narration, the two would meet every evening to drink tea from the cub\'s samovar, which was heated on a fire of juniper twigs. As they drank their tea, the hedgehog and the bear would converse and count the stars together. On this day, the hedgehog decides to bring the bear cub some raspberry jam. As Hedgehog heads out, a sinister looking eagle-owl is following him. Hedgehog passes through the woods and encounters a beautiful white horse standing in a fog. He is curious as to whether the horse would drown if it went to sleep in the fog. The hedgehog decides to explore the fog for himself. As he goes down an incline into the fog, it is soon so thick that the hedgehog can\'t even see his own pink paw. The fog alternately thickens and thins; when it thins the hedgehog briefly catches vague sight of objects and creatures which disappear again as the fog thickens. Hedgehog finds himself in a surreal and often frightening world inhabited by shapes which are not always identifiable and various creatures ranging from dangerous predators to benevolent animals, in a world of silence and rustles, of darkness, tall grass and enchanting stars. The owl, which has been following the hedgehog, appears near him suddenly and hoots only to disappear again, prompting the Hedgehog to call it psycho . He is frightened, but his curiosity keeps him exploring the unknown. Occasionally an unseen distant voice is heard calling out for Hedeghog. Hedgehog explores a large hollow tree, then panics as he realises he has dropped the raspberry jam he was carrying. He encounters a large dog, which is initially frightening to Hedgehog, until the dog retrieves the jam for him. Later he falls into a river and believes he is going to drown as he floats downstream on his back until he is rescued by a mysterious Somebody  in the river that "speaks" to him silently and sets him on shore. The Hedgehog finds himself at the campfire where friend Bear cub is brewing tea. Bear  says how worried he was at Hedgehog\'s absence; he had been calling out to him but heard no answer. The two sit together, contemplating how good it is to be together again—and the mysterious horse in the fog. The characters Hedgehog and Bear Cub are convivial and tame. In contrast, the eagle-owl is more wild and mischievous, lacking Hedgehog\'s introversion.'] ['{{Plot}} The cartoon opens with two mice, both resembling Nibbles, dressed as Indians  and walking toward Jerry\'s house. They knock on the door and hand him a note which reads: "Dear Scoutmaster Jerry. These are the two little orphans you promised to take on a hiking trip. Thanks, Bide a wee Mouse Home". Jerry then pats them on their head and he leaves to put on his scoutmaster uniform. The two mice then start scouting around. When Jerry returns, he sees one of the mice heading toward Spike who is asleep. The mouse goes into Spike\'s mouth and attempts to shoot an arrow at Spike\'s uvula, but Jerry intervenes. Spike wakes up and looks menacingly at the two of them. To distract him, Jerry starts playing "Turkey in the Straw" on the bow and arrow like a violin. This allows Jerry and the mouse to get away. Jerry then shakes his head at the little mouse as if to say, "Don\'t do that." Jerry then sees the other mouse trying to shoot a robin sitting in a tree. The little mouse shoots his arrow in the air and Jerry scolds him. The arrow then falls through the drain pipe and ends up hitting him in the rear. Jerry then leads his scouts on their hiking trip. But the scouts stop and see Tom asleep under a tree. One mouse grabs his tomahawk and the other grabs his bow and arrow and they head over to Tom. Jerry then realizes his scouts are not with him and he see what is about to happen. The mouse with the tomahawk grabs the top of Tom\'s head and tries to scalp him, but Jerry stops it. This wakes up Tom. Tom then looks around and goes back to sleep. The mouse with the red feather has made his way to Tom\'s rear and he gets ready to fire. Jerry tries to stop the arrow but he is too late and Tom jumps up and screams. When he lands to confront Jerry, Jerry readies the bow and points it in Tom\'s face. But Jerry does not know how to use a bow and arrow and he ends up misfiring three times. Tom, realizing that Jerry is no harm to him , grins and lets Jerry try to aim at him. The little Indian mouse then shows up and successfully shoots an arrow into Tom\'s nose. Tom then grabs Jerry, but he is saved when the mouse with the blue feather chops off the tip of Tom\'s tail. Tom screams in pain and grabs the blue-feathered mouse, but he gets saved when the red-feathered mouse scalps Tom. Tom grabs the second mouse and he is saved when Jerry hits Tom with the mailbox. The three of them run away. As they run away, they all split in different directions. When Tom chases them, his head goes one way, his arms and torso go another, and his feet, a third. Then he brings himself back together. He goes after Jerry and pushes the spikes in the fence together catching Jerry by his tail. Tom grabs Jerry and the two mice try to save him. But Tom uses a flyswatter to hurt and send them away. Tom starts to walk away with Jerry but he stops when the blue mouse fools him with fake smoke signals, while the red mouse starts to paint faces on badminton shuttlecocks to make them look like a tribe of Indian mice. This frightens Tom and he ends up tying Jerry to a post. He then grabs a coonskin cap and defends himself with a rifle behind a table. One of the mice fires an arrow with a frying pan tied to it. The arrow hits a rail and swings. Tom readies his gun and just before he fires, the pan hits him in the back of the head making him look like an elephant with the rifle as a nose. The mice then run away and then dress up Spike like an Indian chief. They also paint a mean face on him with war paint. When Tom sees Spike he gets so scared that the coonskin cap stands on end  and he runs away and hides in a folding chair. One of the mice then lights a match and shoots it at Tom. It hits the chair and burns it up. Tom then runs away and hides behind the table he set up. The two mice then run up to Tom and the blue mouse climbs up the barrel of the gun, while the red one opens his pouch of gunpowder. The blue mouse then knocks on the hammer of the gun and he emerges shooting an arrow into Tom\'s nose. Then he runs away. Tom fires a few rounds and chases after the mouse not realizing that the gunpowder is trailing behind him. The second mouse comes out and lights the gunpowder trail. Tom then chases the mouse into a garage and he escapes through the window. Tom stops at the window where a small pile of gunpowder starts to form and he continues firing at the mouse. Next to him is a can of gas and oil can. Then he sees the flame follow him into the garage. Tom tries to run out the garage but he is still holding the rifle which ends up blocking him from leaving. The flame ignites the gas can and the whole garage explodes. The garage folds neatly and Tom surrenders with a white ribbon tied around his gun. Jerry and the mice are then shown smoking a peace pipe. They pass the pipe to Tom and he tries to exhale the smoke from his mouth but no avail. Tom accidentally swallows the smoke and it ends up coming out of his ears.'] ['Welles , taking a break from the filming of Othello, is driving in the Irish countryside one night when he offers a ride to a man with car trouble.

Bugs is easily conned into buying the straw house cheap. Along comes the Wolf, reading the book, too. As per the plot, he blows down the straw house just as homeowner Bugs starts to greet him with his catchphrase. Bugs then buys the wooden house from the second pig, and the three then hole up in the brick house - knowing from the book that the Wolf can\'t blow it down. Along comes the Wolf again, book in hand, and blows down the wooden house over Bugs\' objections. That prompts the Bunny to deliver payback to the Wolf. To get revenge on the Wolf, Bugs dresses up as Little Red Riding Hood and skips down the roadway. He meets the Wolf sitting under a tree, reading the end of the story. The Wolf asks the "girl" where she is going and Bugs flips the Wolf\'s book a few pages. The Wolf then speed-reads "Little Red Riding Hood" until he realises he\'s behind schedule for that story. The Wolf races over to Grandma\'s house and claiming he has no time to eat her, kicks her out of the house with barely time to get her nightclothes on. The Rabbit in Red arrives shortly thereafter. When Bugs Bunny says what big eyes, ears, teeth, and feet the wolf has when he\'s in grandma\'s clothing, he pokes both the wolf\'s eyes, pulls his ears up and down, and pull out his teeth and back in his mouth. The Wolf retaliates by pulling on Bugs\' ears, but Bugs counters that by stepping on the Wolf\'s foot. After both of them strip each other\'s disguises they argue. Bugs then refuses to give the Wolf the "present" he brought him. After the Wolf begs Bugs to give him his present, Bugs relents and puts the present  right into the Wolf\'s face. Pursued down the basement steps of Grandma’s house, Bugs turns off the light switch downstairs, making the Wolf to go back to the upstairs switch to restore the light rather than risk Bugs\' scounterattack. After this procedure is repeated, Bugs tricks the Wolf by saying "click" instead of actually turning off the light, prompting the Wolf to automatically turn the upstairs light off and continue down the stairs, allowing Bugs to hit him. Bugs tries to escape on a bicycle, but it turns out to be a tandem with the Wolf in the second seat. He steers into a clothesline, yanking the Wolf out of the seat. When Bugs chides the Wolf for blowing his houses down, the Wolf explains those are the Pigs\' houses and Bugs then sees it all. Arriving at the brick house, Bugs overhears the pigs gloating about cheating him into buying their houses. He directs the Wolf to blow down the house. The Wolf says he can\'t because he can\'t in the book. Bugs retorts: "Book, shmook! Blow da house down!". The pigs laugh as the wolf blows, and then the house suddenly blows up. The Wolf says, "I did it!" The pigs look at him in surprise and say, "He did it!". Then the scene cuts to Bugs, who pats a TNT detonator and says, "Eh, we did it!".'] ["When one of the actors on a movie set doesn't show up, Charlie gets his chance to be on camera and replaces the actor.

The grey mouse uses a fishing line to lower Jerry to the bottom of the chimney. Jerry hits Tom with a fly swatter, leaving it in Tom\'s hand, and the grey mouse quickly reels him back up the chimney, making Tom believe that he attacked himself in his sleep, similar to the plot of Gas Light. Four more gags are used before they are discovered: GAG 1: Jerry gets a gun, puts it in Tom\'s hands, and pulls the trigger with a second string; then the grey mouse pulls him up. Tom wakes up startled, panics and the gun fires a second time, burning the top of his head. Jerry mimics the exact appearance of Tom\'s head such that his partner can see. GAG 2: Tom is worryingly pondering how he could have shot himself and goes to sleep, troubled immensely. Jerry drills a hole in the ceiling and drops a rope with a noose in it. Tom hears the noise and wakes up. He turns his head and gets it caught in the rope. A second, straight section of rope comes down and Tom grabs it while trying to go back to sleep. Tom wakes up, puzzled, and notices he\'s trying to hang himself. He pulls on the rope and then screams, pushing the rope away from himself. Because of this, the chandelier falls on top of him and knocks him out. Jerry mimes the fall to his buddy. GAG 3: Jerry gets a knife from his buddy and places it in Tom\'s hands. Jerry splatters ketchup on Tom\'s chest and on the knife and tugs on the rope in order to be reeled in. Tom wakes up, screams and runs backwards into a wall, thinking that he has stabbed himself. He grabs his chest and some of the ketchup is on his hand. Thinking that it is blood, Tom screams again, inflates himself and lets himself float through the house. As Tom bounces on the ceiling, he spots the ketchup bottle. He tastes the "blood" and finds it is ketchup. He laughs, but lets go of the pressure that keeps him inflated and he bounces through the house and falls onto his pillow again. He gets up, giggles, and falls to sleep. Jerry mimes this last gesture and the mouse titters. GAG 4: While he is laughing his head off about the last gag, the grey mouse spots an archery bow. Jerry positions it on both ends of Tom and tugs on the string. Tom wakes up and stretches, but this activates the bow. Tom sits up, confused, and is then shot into the plumbing, and into the furnace. Tom yells and launches himself out of the furnace, up the water pipe, and down the chimney as the two mice look on. However, Tom spots them and has had enough of their tricks. He points a gun at Jerry and the grey mouse. Later, Jerry and the grey mouse are trapped in a bottle. If they remove the cork, they will be shot by a gun, with the trigger pulled by a yarn.

The 2 cats frantically begin their search for Jerry, and are unsuspectingly aided by him, before realizing Jerry was under their noses the whole time.

He lets go of Tom\'s foot and grabs his foot, screaming appropriately. The chase continues as Tom and Butch both grab Jerry together and decide to have a duel using a pair of guns they find lying around. Tom turns around early and shoots Butch as he turns around, but both finds out he is holding a "novelty gun", which whacks Butch on the nose. Butch  angrily chases Tom into the wall, but when Tom sees exactly the same brand name on it, Tom assumes it is another novelty gun, chuckles at this and snaps his fingers in victory. Extremely angry at this turn of events, Butch proceeds to shoot Tom; the gun goes off, and he has barely dodged the bullet, but it comes out of the wall, rolls down the head and onto his nose.  Meanwhile, Jerry enters an oven, Tom and Butch slam the door and turn on the gas as Jerry sneaks out, lights a match and drops it in the oven. Tom and Butch open the oven door, puzzled as to wondering why the oven hasn\'t exploded yet...and then it does, leaving them in blackface.

Jerry escapes from the box and rings a boxing gong, ending the fight, and cleans up and coaches Tom and Butch to hit each other. Jerry rings the gong and both cats end up punching each other, as planned. They realise they\'ve been tricked and glance towards Jerry, who is making fun of them by punching the air. Both of them pull up on either side of the mouse, incensed at the idea of a mouse tricking them into bopping each other. Eventually seeing he is trapped between the two cats and thus also realising that he pushed them around too far, the mouse chooses Butch via Eeny Meeny Mine Mo, makes a face to Tom, and sits down in Butch\'s hand. Butch assumes that he has Jerry in his clutches and dares Tom to walk out in the morning. Tom slumps down and walks away, then hides behind a curtain. Butch is reveling in his victory until Tom reaches out and grabs Jerry directly out of the other cat\'s hand.

Tom simply continues with the charade, and Butch grabs Tom, revealing the mouse underneath, who soon sees Tom is missing. Butch drops him into the trash can and chases Jerry. Annoyed, Tom runs into the kitchen, dressing himself in Mammy\'s clothing to trick Butch. Butch enters the kitchen, with Jerry clenched in his fist, and offers him to Tom, thinking that he is Mammy.

After the train pulls out of the station, Tweety sings his signature song: :I\'m a tweet wittle bird in a diwded tage, :Tweety\'s my name, but I don\'t know my age. :I don\'t have to wowwy and dat is dat, :I\'m tafe in here fwom dat ol\' puddytat. Tweety then notices Sylvester in the cage next to his and gives his catchline, "I tawt I taw a puddytat!" He looks again to make sure: "I did! I did! I did taw a puddytat!" Sylvester then opens the small door of his carrier and extends his paw to tap on the door of Tweety\'s cage. Tweety answers, and as Sylvester tries to grab him, the vigilant conductor swats his paw with a cane. The conductor hangs Tweety\'s cage on a hook in the ceiling to keep him safe and sound and warns Sylvester to behave. As soon as the conductor leaves the car, Sylvester proceeds to stack various articles of baggage to reach Tweety\'s cage. When Sylvester tries to grab Tweety again, Tweety finds the emergency cord and pulls it, causing the train to screech to an instant halt and sending Sylvester sailing through the air across two passenger cars and into the engine\'s furnace. Sylvester quickly leaps out and runs back to the baggage car, and as he angrily stalks Tweety, Tweety pulls the cord again, restarting the train and sending Sylvester through the air into a garbage can lid that Tweety has found. Sylvester then starts chasing Tweety, but the conductor interrupts the chase and orders Sylvester back into his cage. In the next scene, Sylvester is in his cage next to a bulldog, who starts growling at him. Annoyed, Sylvester shouts "Aaaaaaah, shut up!" and whacks the bulldog with an umbrella, but Hector keeps growling.

Sylvester slides back down as the train continues to climb, and the bulldog punches him again. As Sylvester starts sliding down yet again, the train starts moving down the incline, sending Sylvester sliding back to the wall and making him think he is safe, until he sees the bulldog sliding down toward him with fist extended to punch him again, prompting Tweety to say: "Poor puddytat!" Sylvester makes another attempt at stacking the baggage to reach Tweety. Tweety reaches for the emergency cord again, only to see that it has been cut and that Sylvester is holding it. But Tweety pulls it anyway, and again sends Sylvester flying. Sylvester comes back and snatches Tweety, but when he hears the conductor\'s footsteps, he stuffs Tweety into a mailbag and leaves it on a hook alongside the track. Sylvester smiles sheepishly as the conductor walks by, then dashes to the observation car to grab the mailbag. He reaches inside and instead of Tweety finds the bulldog, who immediately chases him away. As Tweety is swinging inside his cage, Sylvester saws a hole in the roof and again finds the bulldog, instead of Tweety, who starts pursuing Sylvester atop the train. Sylvester momentarily eludes the bulldog by ducking into a space between two cars, then both start running in the opposite direction. As Sylvester prepares to knock the bulldog out with a club, the train heads into a tunnel, slamming Sylvester in the face into the bridge above it. The train finally returns to Gower Gulch station, where Sylvester, disguised as Tweety\'s "mommy", gets out of a taxi and rushes to the baggage car to claim him. The conductor hands him the cage, which is covered, and Sylvester hurries back to the taxi with the cage. As the taxi drives away, Sylvester uncovers the cage, it was revealed that the bulldog is inside the cage instead of Tweety! The taxi pauses at a mile marker post, and the bulldog rips it out and pummels Sylvester with it as the taxi speeds along the road.

Shortly after, he is waken up by some crunching noises, warning him of intruders. Using a rocket that creates a flare in the sky, the dog spots the Goofy Gophers  eating some of the vegetables, so he disguises himself as a tomato vine  and poses as the actual plant in the garden. As morning dawns, Mac and Tosh go about the garden taking up every vegetable that looks interesting, including a real long carrot . Mac gathers up the "tomatoes" just as Tosh imitates Bugs Bunny saying "What\'s up, doc?" While Mac is studying the pumpkin, the dog blows his cover and after asking him if he\'d tried the pumpkin, Mac throws it into his face. Mac then asks the dog if he\'d had his daily iron, to which after the dog answers no, Mac hits him over the head with a shovel. The dog runs after Mac, but Mac dives into a hole and the shovel prevents the dog from pursuing him. After gathering up a bushel of vegetables and posing as Southern speaking ladies, Mac and Tosh duck back into their holes. The dog tries digging them out, but Tosh squirts him with a tomato. The gophers then taunt the dog from many holes as he tries to decapitate them with the clippers. While the dog\'s back is turned, the gophers take the advantage to give him the ultimate "hot foot" , which sends the dog fleeing for the rain barrel to extinguish it. Next, the gophers pull down vegetables to the tune of a Conga beat. The dog\'s first attempt to stop them only results in Mac punching him in the nose, so the dog ducks behind vegetables and disguises himself as the scarecrow. Right after the dog states how his "razor keen mind" aids him, he is pulled into the ground, but kicked out again, along with the scarecrow, dressed as a telegram man from Western Onion, complete with a note from the gophers which reads "We\'re vegetarians, you dope!" Underground, Tosh tries to make choices on certain fruit and vegetables, only to have them turned down by Mac . The gophers then come across a celery, which has been bobby-trapped by the dog, but the gophers turn the tables on him by having the dog pull himself underground. Straight after, the gophers proceed to steamroll him into the ground and call him "Silly Boy!" The dog manages to get out of the ground and reaches into another hole for the gophers. Mac, however, stalls him with a hand grenade, making the dog pull out the pin. Spotting the pin on his finger, the dog starts showing it off as if it were a class ring, but while passing over the grenade underground, the grenade explodes and makes him fall flat to the ground, looking worse for the wear. Later, while the gophers are relaxing eating vegetables, an attractive Southern Belle gopher  comes up, attracting the gophers\' lovestruck interest. Mac takes the first opportunity to dance with the female gopher and allows Tosh to cut in. Tosh\'s turn to dance has him pull off the female gopher, exposing the dog\'s paw. The gophers then turn the tables on the dog again by tricking his paw into dancing straight into a mousetrap. That evening, the dog takes a stick of dynamite, puts it into a carrot he cuts in half, and lights the fuse, but Mac cuts the fuse and Tosh fakes the explosion with a blown up paper bag. Thinking he\'s rid of the gophers for good, the dog celebrates by doing another round of guarding and then falling asleep. The gophers, however, put him on the rocket launcher and aim it for the moon. Next, they shove a stick of dynamite into the dog\'s mouth, light it, and Mac sets up a camera. As Tosh blows into a bird\'s whistle, the dog wakes up and poses for a picture, but the dynamite explodes, sending him flying into space and crashing into the moon so that it breaks into four quarter moons, rocking to the closing notes of the tune Rock-a-bye Baby. Triumphant in their defeat of the dog, the gophers saw down the "Beware of dog" sign and rejoice. Just as Mac and Tosh gloat that they\'ll now have no trouble in raiding the garden, their moment of victory is cut short by crunching sounds. The camera reveals it is Bugs Bunny, having just eaten the gophers\' stash of carrots, who says "Well, um, now I wouldn\'t say that," just as a closing iris ends the cartoon.'] ['{{Plot|date Grunt the Caveman Fishing GearDorf and His Wife - Segment OneThe D.I.P.

Jerry and Tom then proceed to toggle the radio on and off until Tom hides behind the radio when Jerry turns it on, and then Tom pulls the plug. Jerry peeps out and attempts to turn the radio on, but fails. Before Tom can quell the radio again, a news bulletin announces on loose that there is a dancing bear, who dances down the street, stumbles by Tom and Jerry\'s house, spots fruit on a nearby table and munches on them. Tom spots the bear and extends his arm stealthily across the room and grabs the phone to call the cops.  Jerry, meanwhile, plugs back in the radio. The bear then jumps into the house, grabs Tom before he can begin to call, and starts up a dance. Jerry looks astounded and sees this is a great opportunity to play with the cat. As the bear dances past the radio, Tom turns it off. The bear stares blankly at the cat, then drops him and resumes eating the fruit. Tom again attempts to use the phone, but Jerry is ready to turn the radio back on. Tom grabs the mouse, but the station button is still within reach and soon the cat is dragged across the floor by the bear. Tom then stuffs the bear into a closet, cuts the plug, and chases the mouse. Jerry escapes the cat and hides in a full automatic record player. Tom cannot see him. Jerry plays a classical-music record. The bear breaks out of the closet when he hears the music, takes the door with him and runs right into the cat. Both cat and bear have their hands poked through a hole in the door and thus the bear can begin a tango dance . Tom recovers and knocks on his side of the door. The bear closes the door on him and pushes Tom into a grandfather clock. He wonders where the cat may have gone and then he grabs the door. However, Tom takes the place of the pendulum inside while the bear continues the tango alone. Tom spots the mouse waltzing by himself on top of the record player and breaks the record over Jerry\'s head. The chase resumes briefly until Jerry jumps on a piano and starts playing The Blue Danube. Tom then flees, but is soon met by the bear. Tom grabs a scraper and hits the mouse off the piano with it as he is passing by. Jerry lands on top of an ukulele and plays a jazz rhythm. Tom then tricks the bear into dancing right through the floor grate, and he breaks the ukulele while Jerry is playing. Jerry turns on a small portable radio and a second bulletin plays announcing a larger reward for the dancing bear.  Tom tries yet again to use the phone, but is interrupted by the music from the small radio. Tom dives through the various floor grates and then traps the bear in a folding couch. Tom chases Jerry outside, catches him, and takes the radio. He throws it into the air, but it slides across a branch and clicks on against an offshoot. Tom is shocked in bitterness when he hears that the music will continue for six hours and the bear asks him for a dance. To finish his reasons, he accepts it and lets Jerry escape. Tom dances with the bear in the moon. Then the animators grow black bars as the screen gets smaller. "THE END" then fades in near the moon.'] ['The film opens on the studio set of a fictional 1990s TV show, The Gourmet Detective. This is depicted as a crass cross-genre detective/cookery series , whose lead character  presents his recipe in a style that parodies Keith Floyd. Allen\'s "on-screen" Gourmet Detective character is the epitome of politically correct "new man" compassion, but the actor "off-screen" is shown to be an obnoxious, drug-taking womaniser. He is subsequently murdered – the second TV detective to be killed in six months – and the rest of the film involves the search for his assassin. The police commander (played by [[Jim Carter  is exasperated that the detective assigned to the case, Dave Spanker, has come up with lots of "Northern nostalgia" but no leads. Cheesecloth and the footprint of a 1970s platform shoe are found at the scene, inspiring him to bring in 1970s-style detectives to help solve the crime – initially Bonehead, Foyle and George. When the platform shoe is revealed to be from the early 1970s, Jason Bentley is added to the team, and the commander insists that Bentley\'s methods alone are to be used . Bentley consequently drives the detectives to a random country house, drinks copious claret, smokes endless cigarettes, and predictably gets nowhere with the case. The frustrated detectives have a punch-up while they are – on Bentley\'s advice – "waiting for a Mini Moke to turn up". The commander gives the team a dressing-down, and explains that, with the TV-cop-killer still at large, the production of various 1990s TV cop shows is under threat. In order to highlight further the writers\' views of contemporary TV detective shows, he lists these as The Dull as Dishwater Detective, Detectives on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown and The Whistling Detective Who Lives on a Barge. The Dull as Dishwater Detective is apparently in hiatus because "the actor\'s run abroad, he\'s scared" – a reference to the real TV series Inspector Morse, whose lead actor John Thaw was making A Year in Provence at this time. Thaw had previously played Regan in The Sweeney. Bonehead, Foyle and George insist they be allowed to proceed with the investigation their way, complete with fast cars and guns. The commander reluctantly agrees to give them 48 hours, and they gleefully wheel-spin away to a rendezvous at an East End drinking den. Meanwhile, a sheepish Bentley asks to see the original lab reports. At the pub, George asks to see his informant, while Bonehead and Foyle order Babychams then storm the toilet cubicles the way they might storm an embassy. However, Bentley provides the breakthrough. He reveals that the forensic report proves the platform shoes were bought in Newcastle upon Tyne. After Spanker confesses that he committed the crimes due to TV ratings pressure, he makes his escape. There ensues a 1970s-style high-speed car chase involving all but Bentley, based mainly in a large yard where all three cars drive around somewhat pointlessly in circles. The repeated handbrake-turns wreck Foyle\'s gearbox and, in frustration at missing out on the car chase, Bonehead briefly considers leaving his partner. However, the chase continues on foot into London Docklands, where Spanker takes refuge. Bonehead and Foyle – as is customary for them – remove their trousers for this final showdown, and then bemoan the Docklands redevelopment that has taken place since the 1970s: "where\'s all the wasteland and disused factories?". They nevertheless negotiate the area trouserlessly as if it is still full of rusty girders and rubble, to the bemusement of passing city workers. Meanwhile, George attempts to talk Spanker into a surrender. Spanker complains that, with the increased realism in TV detective shows, he has missed out on the fast cars and the "shoot a man at a hundred yards crap" enjoyed by his 1970s counterparts. To prove the point, he feels no ill effects when George shoots him from this very distance as an apparent 1970s denouement to the scene. However, Bentley now magically appears exactly where the plot requires him to appear, right alongside Spanker. In a typically relaxed and tangential fashion, he manages to capture the detective effortlessly. George devises a punishment for Spanker far worse than being shot at close range – Spanker will instead be "shot on tape". He has his scruffy hair cut to a regulation police constable\'s length, in order to take his place as "a faceless copper in uniform - three nights a week". Spanker\'s suitably TV-based punishment is to become a member of the cast of The Bill. The film ends on an up-beat note, with Bonehead, Foyle, George, Bentley and the commander all drinking to "the Seventies".'] ['The cartoon opens with a town of Hicksville preparing to welcome Miss Glory. In a nearby hotel, a bellhop, Abner, is anxiously awaiting her arrival, and has prepared for it, but falls asleep while waiting. As he "sleeps", he enters a dream sequence whereupon the hotel ends up morphing into the Cosmopolitan Hotel, an upscale big city hotel, with Abner morphing into a bellboy at the same. A man arrives and asks the now grown-up bellboy to deliver a message to Miss Glory, who is staying at that hotel. At this point, a band begins singing, with Abner the bellboy joining in singing "Page Miss Glory" . The distinct pronunciation in how the bellboy says "Glory" as "Glore-EE" is loosely based upon the bellboy character in the Philip Morris cigarette advertisements on radio and later television who always called out for "Phil-ip More-Iss" as he made his way through a hotel. That character was played by Johnny Roventini for nearly 40 years. The bellboy eventually "meets" someone who he thinks is Miss Glory, but makes the mistake of standing on the train of her dress, ripping it off just as she crosses behind a potted plant. This woman then takes two large leaves off the same plant and begins performing a fan dance, oblivious to the fact that others are watching her dancing for a while. Eventually, the presence of "Miss Glory" is announced over the hotel\'s PA system, with everyone in the hotel apparently recognizing who Miss Glory is. Abner, in his rush to try to see her, is unable to get into any elevator for a while everyone else rushes, and eventually the bellboy brings back one of the elevators by turning its arrow, only for the elevator operator to then refuse to take him up. While "Miss Glory" is performing in the upper floors of the hotel , the boy is trying to figure out how to work the elevator, but ends up "knocked" out of the building and in front of a streetcar, which actually turns out to be the local hotel manager in Hicksville awakening Abner from his dream sequence to tell him that Miss Glory has indeed arrived—who turns out to be a young prepubescent girl, with Abner taken aback.'] ['{{Plot}} When Tom knocks down some crockery while secretly tucking into some chicken.

Jerry makes sure to take the chase past Spike, who is astounded that someone got to his bone. While Tom keeps up the chase, Spike bites on the bone attached to Tom\'s tail, but gets tangled up in a tree with the cat. Tom ends up in possession of the bone, and when Spike growls, Tom puts it in Spike\'s mouth, but then winds it up and blows Spike away as if he were a model airplane. Spike decides to go to sleep by his house. Meanwhile, Jerry screws a piece of magnetic iron into Spike\'s bone, then places a magnet in a sleeping Tom\'s mouth, causing the bone to end up being attracted to Tom, no matter how many times or how hard Spike tries to retain his grip on the bone and Tom tries to rid himself of it. Tom throws the bone out into the street where Spike chases it, only to miss it twice, in midair then off the fence, which he bites through. He finally does get a hold of it, only to lose it running into the fork of a tree, managing to grab it once more with his tongue before losing it once more. Tom winds up running off down the street with the bone following him , pursued by Spike, with the magnetic bone remaining close to Tom.

Jerry is then attacked . While Jerry watches Tom for any further shenanigans, he fails to see the wall in front of him and runs into it. The cat laughs and sits down, and Jerry breaks out of the wall and onto the floor. The impact force tips a bottle of white shoe polish from the shelf above to fall out and colour Jerry white. Tom, rid of Jerry for the moment, reads a magazine and listens to the radio until a breaking news story is announced, that an escaped laboratory white mouse, that has consumed explosives that can blow up an entire city is on the loose. The slightest jar would cause the mouse to explode. While listening to this, Jerry knows that Tom will mistake him for the white mouse. Indeed, the cat is scared: he slams the open window shut and relaxes himself by eating some nuts. As he breaks open the nuts with a hammer, Jerry uses this opportunity and stands on the table. Tom grabs the mouse, thinking he is a nut, but stops the hammer when he feels Jerry, and looks to see the "white" mouse. Tom jumps away and dashes to the phone to call the police. Jerry whistles at him and tries to fall off the table, and Tom immediately sets a pillow for Jerry to fall on.

He blows his lungs out before getting it in his face. Tom begins a chase, which ends quickly when Jerry threatens to hit himself with a hammer. The cat begs the "white mouse" not to do it, and Jerry takes this chance to whack his enemy on the head. Tom stopped by the mouse renewing his "suicidal" threat allows Jerry to hit him on the head several times. Satisfied, the rodent filches a few cookies, which gives the cat the chance to swipe the hammer. In response, Jerry bounces himself on the counter making the cat to flinch. The mouse continues bouncing across the counter, but does not see the sink full of water and loses his disguise. Tom sees this and allows Jerry to bounce and hits himself with the hammer. Not knowing he\'s been exposed, Jerry hits himself even harder and ends up bruising himself. Tom then takes the hammer and pounds Jerry into the counter like a nail. To complete his enemy\'s torment, Tom grabs Jerry by the tail and takes him to the mirror to show him that the disguise did not work. Jerry sheepishly smiles, and is thrown out of the house. Meanwhile, the true white mouse appears through the mail slot and as Tom kicks Jerry out, he runs into the house. Tom goes back to reading his magazine and he hears the white mouse eating some nuts.

Tom notices that he is carrying the real white mouse and gets the fright of his life. Trembling, he fumbles over the phone to call the police, but before he can dial the number, the radio announcer comes back on the air with news that the mouse isn\'t liable to explode. Tom cheers up instantly and takes the white mouse to be kicked out of the window and Jerry jumps off the window and is not seen in the cartoon again. The moment his foot makes contact, a massive explosion reduces the entire town to a giant crater. All that is left of the neighborhood is rubble and the speaker of the radio which states: "We repeat, the white mouse will not explode".

Jerry hides behind a potato mound in a garden when he hears Spike the bulldog call to him. Spike has been caught by a dog catcher and locked in the back of his truck, and Jerry is the only one who can help him escape from the truck before it drives away. Despite their differences , Jerry shows Spike mercy and frees him by removing a piece of wood that latches the cage shut. Spike falls out of the truck just as it pulls away, and thanks Jerry by vowing to assist the mouse at any time at the sound of a whistle. Completely carefree, Jerry strolls down the sidewalk, and Tom jumps out from around the corner with a plate, a fork, and a knife, and a napkin around his neck. As Jerry screeches to a stop and reverses direction, Tom sneaks around the fence and holds out two pieces of bread just as the mouse passes by, such that Jerry is unable to stop in time. Just as Tom starts to cut the bread in half with Jerry in it, Jerry whistles and Spike makes the save by grabbing Tom by the neck. He checks on Jerry to make sure he is O.K. and then issues Tom an ultimatum: the cat had better leave Jerry alone or he will face the consequences; and to prove his point, he squashes Tom into an accordion before walking off, reminding his pal once again to "just whistle". Seeing an opportunity to provoke Tom, Jerry picks up a tiny board and challenges the cat to a fight, who flippantly flicks the board away and prepares to punch the mouse into oblivion. Jerry then whistles and before the punch lands, Spike zooms in and his own punch lands onto Tom\'s face, which leaves the cat dazed in front of a city mailbox behind him. Once again, Spike reminds Jerry of their pact: "Anytime, chum". Tom then tries to smash Jerry with a lead pipe and the resulting chase takes the duo to Spike. Jerry perches on the dog and pushes on Spike\'s nose to reveal a sharp set of teeth, as if to say "Stay away from me". Before the canine can attack him, Tom wriggles out of the situation by kissing Jerry, dropping him in a stroller and rolling the mouse down the street, using the pipe as a flute. When he passes behind a set of garbage cans, Tom basks in his victory by laughing menacingly; in the same evil voice, he utters "Infinite power!" Unfortunately, the cat\'s attraction to the opposite sex gets the better of him when he soon spots a cute female cat and loudly wolf-whistles at her, momentarily forgetting that this will lead to Spike attacking him. The dog pops up behind him and use two garbage can lids as cymbals on Tom\'s head. Later, Tom spots Jerry strolling along, still on top of the world and soon the cat notices a bubble gum machine nearby. He shakes, throttles, and nudges the machine to obtain two gumballs, then covers one of them in glue. So as to get Jerry to eat the other piece of gum, the cat sits down and draws attention to himself chewing his piece. The manner in which Tom methodically enjoys his gum makes Jerry hungry for a piece. Tom then offers Jerry the glue-covered gumball, and Jerry suspiciously smells it, but follows through and starts chewing the gum. Jerry then shakes Tom\'s hand as a thank you and Tom winks at the camera. Quickly, the mouse figures out that the gum has glued his mouth shut and that he is unable to whistle . Using a similar trick to Tom\'s earlier in the cartoon, Jerry points to his lips and rubs his stomach as if to say that he adored the gum, then leaves the scene with Tom in pursuit. Jerry quickly shakes his hand again and runs away with Tom behind him. Jerry briefly stops the chase to attempt to whistle a second time, and when he is still unable to do so, shrugs and begins to run away again. When he sees an anvil up ahead, the mouse holds it up and Tom runs into it, causing the cat to resemble a table. Jerry tries to escape through a hole in a fence but gets stuck, and as he unsuccessfully tries to free himself, Tom then grabs a slim wooden board and motions to hit Jerry with it...until he sees Spike walk by and decides to wait. Jerry tries to gesture to Spike that he needs help and that he can\'t whistle, but Spike doesn\'t understand what Jerry is saying and will only respond to the whistle. With the danger of retaliation past, Tom whacks Jerry all the way towards Spike again. Jerry tries again to tell his friend what happened and begs Spike to help him . Spike laughs at this, calls it "baby talk", and goes inside a yard. Jerry then pounds on the door for help, but has to run away from the approaching cat. As Spike opens the door, Tom\'s head gets stuck in Spike\'s mouth, forcing the cat to again shrug and run away. The mouse eventually crawls through another hole in a different fence and tries to whistle until he turns red in the face. Eventually, Jerry blows a bubble and it keeps enlarging as Jerry forces more air into it. Tom climbs over the fence to chase the mouse, but soon sees the bubble growing to a gigantic size and cringes in terror as it explodes and bursts into flames. A long, shrill whistle is emitted by the released air and Jerry\'s cleared mouth, and Tom pleads with Jerry to stop whistling, but he keeps going. "Knowing" Spike will completely whale on him, he digs his own grave, but Spike doesn\'t appear. Tom then writes his will, which says "I Thomas leave all to charity". As Tom finishes writing, both cat and mouse look up in puzzlement at the dog\'s disappearance, and once more find him locked up in the back of the dog catcher\'s truck again. This time, a padlock keeps the door shut so that Spike will no longer be able to escape the same way again and can no longer help his friend. Still whistling, Jerry chases the truck down the road with Tom chasing him.'] ["In a tavern, Krazy is playing the piano while his spaniel girlfriend is sitting on it and singing.

As in the previous two shorts, Ralph attempts to steal some sheep by burrowing under the field. After finding Sam waiting for Ralph above one of his holes, Ralph attempts to look innocuous, but Sam hits him over the head with a large wooden mallet . As in previous shorts, Ralph politely refills his tunnel. 2. Ralph next attempts to fashion himself a tightrope over the field by throwing a spear with a rope attached to a tree on the other side of the field. After walking across the tightrope and snagging a sheep with a lasso, he makes his way back to the cliff where the other end of the tightrope was fastened. Unfortunately, it turns out Sam is holding that end of the tightrope. Ralph hands the sheep over and begins running the other direction before Sam releases his end of the tightrope. Just before Ralph begins to fall, he manages to grab on to the spear that was attached to the tree. However, as Ralph looks to the left, it turns out Sam is also holding that end of the tightrope. Sam launches the spear &mdash; and Ralph &mdash; over the horizon. 3. Ralph next attempts to shoot a rocket with a lasso attached at Sam. The contraption very successfully catches Sam and carries him off into the distance. Ralph, enamoured with his success, prances down to the field and casually takes his choice of sheep. As he prances away he is hit over the head with a club from Sam, still hanging from the fired rocket now lodged in a tree.  4. Ralph\'s next plan is to disguise himself as Little Bo Peep. He prances up to Sam and shows him a book of nursery rhymes to bolster his disguise. He successfully herds a sheep past Sam and into his cave. However, the viewer soon discovers that the sheep is actually Sam in disguise. Ralph discovers this all too late, and the beating which ensues is left to the viewer\'s imagination. 5. Ralph\'s fifth plan is to fly over the field with an unwieldy helicopter while dangling a claw on a rope and attempting to grab a sheep with the claw, akin to the claw game. Sam casually walks by a yanks on the rope, causing the helicopter to plummet into the ground. After the crash, and much too late, Ralph deliriously attempts to abandon the helicopter and release his parachute, which simply falls on top of him as a shroud. 6. Ralph then attempts to hurl himself over Sam with a lever and a large stone. While successful, Ralph ends up hurling himself into a tree. Sam, sitting at the bottom of the tree, rolls Ralph up into a ball and tosses him over his shoulder, to the sound of bowling pins falling. 7. Ralph next attempts to roll a lit cannon behind Sam\'s back, but Sam simply flips the cannon around so it faces Ralph. As Ralph runs away, the cannon ball lands exactly where Ralph ended up running. 8. Finally, Ralph is sitting in his cave, depressed, and notices the rain outside, when an idea strikes him. He sneaks up behind Sam with a bottle of "Acme Patented Hair Grower " and splashes some on Sam\'s head, who doesn\'t notice because of the rain. When the rain clears up, Sam has even more hair in front of his eyes than usual . Ralph tests to make sure Sam can\'t see him through the unruly mop of hair on his head and then heads down to grab a sheep. However, the moment Ralph lays a finger on the sheep, Sam hurtles down the hill to grab Ralph and pummel him. During the pummelling, the punch clock whistles the end of their shifts. Sam and Ralph punch out, then cordially bid each other a good night.'] ['The Gavins claimed the plot "followed closely the facts contained in the official report of the British Admiralty" about the Fryatt incident, with a Belgian love story added.<ref namehttp://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article22345000 |titleThe Queenslander |location15 December 1917 |accessdate29 |publisher=National Library of Australia}} The film begins after Fryatt, the commander of a merchant ship, has rammed a German submarine, and has returned to London a hero.

Upon reaching the said place, Tuffy becomes excited at the prospect of finally becoming Mousekeeter that he starts lashing away at the door with his rapier. Tuffy thrusts the rapier at the door too hard and is sent flying into one of the nearby empty bottles. At that point, Jerry, being the Captain of the Mouseketeers, opens the door to investigate the ruckus. Jerry notices the note that Tuffy was carrying indicating he was sent by his father François Mouse to be trained by Jerry as a Mouseketeer. Tuffy introduces himself , but his constant talking is too much for Jerry, who cannot keep Tuffy quiet . To see if Tuffy would make a good mouseketeer, Jerry puts him through a series of tests. However, Tuffy fails miserably, bringing destruction to the room, ending with Jerry being stabbed in the rear. While walking down the cobbled Parisian streets, Jerry stops to give way to a pretty female mouse, while Tuffy simply stands and watches. Jerry tells Tuffy to give way to ladies, but Tuffy gives way to a large puddle. Jerry trips over Tuffy and falls face-down in the puddle. Tuffy allows another lady mouse to walk over Jerry. Just as Jerry is about to chastise Tuffy, Tom comes into the scene. Jerry tries to hide Tuffy and himself from Tom\'s view, but Tuffy, ever the confrontational mouse, marches up to Tom and yells "En garde!" As the little rodent counts to trois, Tom slices his hat. Jerry, fearing for Tuffy\'s safety, pushes down an axe. It slices through Tom, who appears unaffected by this. He sticks out his tongue, but then splits into two. Back at Jerry\'s Headquarters, a stern and disgusted Jerry is responding to his friend\'s letter, regretting that Tuffy will never qualify as a mouseketeer. He orders Tuffy out of the building with the disgraceful letter for Tuffy to give to his parents, and Tuffy glumly walks off. Just then, he hears the sounds of swords clashing. Running back, he sees that Tom has ambushed Jerry and now\'s fighting Jerry with Tom winning. Tuffy comes to the rescue by using his sword to slash off the end of Tom\'s tail. Tom screams in pain and leaps into the air. "Touché, Pussy Cat!" exclaims Tuffy. Tom fights back and pins Tuffy to a nearby wall. However, Jerry pulls down on Tom\'s clothing, causing it to expose his underwear. As Tom again tries to fight back, Tuffy, who is hiding inside a barrel behind Tom, chops off his tail once more. "Touché, Pussy Cat!" yells Tuffy . In the next scene, Jerry and Tuffy are running from Tom, but end up getting separated. Tuffy spies some paint and begins painting a simple and unflattering picture of Tom, to the tune of Frère Jacques. Unbeknown to him, Tom is standing right behind him and is not amused. Tuffy points out to Tom his picture of the pussy cat, until he realizes his mistake. Still armed with a paintbrush, he paints on Tom\'s face and runs off, leaving Tom with a painted duo-monocle and moustache on his face. Tom races after Tuffy, who delays Tom by cutting open some champagne bottles, sending several corks into Tom\'s face. As Tom begins to catch up with the little mouse, Tuffy slashes open a huge barrel of wine, which sent a great wave of the wine down the road, engulfing Tom and sending him down the sewers. Tuffy manages to swim to safety on a window\'s ledge, albeit drunk, and observes Tom\'s fate as he goes down the hole. Tuffy then remarks, "Pauvre, pauvre,......Pushee’ Cat" . The final scene shows Jerry awarding Tuffy the coveted title of mouseketeer for his heroics after all. He gives Tuffy the mousketeer garments, and as Tuffy proudly shows off his new clothes and swordfighting skills, he accidentally stabs Jerry in the rear. At the end of the cartoon, Jerry, apparently thinking it was intentional, repeatedly spanks Tuffy, as Tuffy remarks "C\'est la guerre!" . \ufeff'] ['Old MacDonald is tired, and he gets happy as soon as the music starts.

The entire film was shot on a train moving through a continuous mass built from cities and their adjoining regions. The characters are traveling in the suspended generic space of the train through regions composite of old and new economies and old and new social realities: Newly built outer areas around the cities, construction sites, institutional and office buildings, transitory places, between growth and collapse, marked by quasi-contradictory processes of economic progress and development of slums. On the train coach itself, a targeted but sometimes absurd narrative plays itself out as a linguistic reaction to the time and place. Urban environments, and their heterotopic sites, are locations for Knut Åsdam's investigations into social design, patterns of behavior and modes of subjectivity, with a particular focus on spatial identity's disorder and pathologies. Åsdam perceives a city as a machine of desire, its geography as a system of desire and its architecture as a generator of desiring practices. Usage and perception of public urban spaces, their structures of political power and authority occupy a central place in the artist's studies of identities. Oblique premiered for Manifesta7 in July 2008. *Written and directed by: Knut Åsdam *Produced by: Manifesta7, FRAC Bourgogne, Galician Contemporary Art Center with the support from Office for Contemporary Art Oslo, Galleri SE Bergen, Galería Joan Prats Barcelona and the Cultural Council of Norway"] ["The story is of an English manufacturing town in which Henry Little, a workman and inventor, is persecuted by trades unions, jealous because he was better trained than his fellows. Squire Raby, Little's uncle, is a forcible character, and a pleasant love story offsets the labor troubles. A purpose of the novel was to expose, without censure, the errors of early trades unions."] ["The gang stages a big musical revue in Spanky's cellar . Spanky, as the master of ceremonies, persuades the neighborhood kids through song to come to the show, which includes performances by a miniature chorus line, a trio of farm girls, a group of kids dressed as skeletons, and featured spots for Alfalfa and a new girl named Cookie. Backstage, there is pandemonium involving Buckwheat's dealings with a mischievous little monkey, as well as Spanky's worrying over his star act, the Flory-Dory Girls, whose tardiness forces the would-be impressario to keep shuffling his acts. When the show reaches its final act with still no sign of the Flory-Dories, Spanky has the other boys dress in the Flory-Dories' costumes. Since he knows the girls' dance, Spanky figures the gang can pull of the act in drag if everyone just does what he does. Unknown to Spanky, however, the monkey that was terrorizing Buckwheat has hidden in the bustle of Spanky's costume. The monkey pulls a needle from the costume during the dance and begins stabbing Spanky in the rear, and the other boys mimic his out-of-character jolts of pain and discomfort to the audience's amusement. Spanky manages to accidentally shake his dress to the floor, and the other boys follow suit, ruining the act as the audience roars with laughter. Cookie tries to bring down the curtain, but only succeeds in trapping the boys in front of the curtain, causing them to scramble underneath as Spanky closes out the show  and sends the audience of kids home."] ['The story starts with a crowd gathered at the Hollywood sign with Virgil sitting on top of the sign strapped with dynamite preparing to take his life.

As the mice engage in various activities such as card games and playing the harmonica, Sylvester marches outside as the guard cat, discouraging any mouse that would dare escape. In the village, the señorita mice are crying about family members and boyfriends having gone missing . The mayor of the village attempts to recruit volunteers to help rescue their villagers, but realize the situation is hopeless because Sylvester is too fast and smart for them. Then, one of the mice suggests calling on Speedy Gonzales to help with the rescue effort. After realizing that he is on vacation in Guadalajara, another mouse comments that Speedy "would come all the way from Guadalajara to visit my seester Carmella." With that, Carmella is recruited to place a long-distance call to Speedy; seconds after the call is placed, Speedy races to the village to begin the rescue effort. Speedy walks into the patio to great fanfare, much like a bullfighter before his fight, drawing Sylvester\'s attention. The mouse directly taunts the "gringo pussy gato," and Sylvester—perhaps thinking Speedy is the latest attempted would-be rescuer in an apparent long line of hapless victims—sarcastically obliges. Speedy instantly races past Sylvester and rescues Manuelito; the cat\'s attempt to snare them in a rope trap fails, as Speedy\'s quick pace pulls Sylvester through the knothole of the wall he is hiding behind. Sylvester\'s other encounters with Speedy include: * The cat\'s attempt to crush Speedy with a large rock . Speedy then smuggles out several more mice in a tin can and hides behind another rock and in between three cans. Sylvester looks under all three cans, the final one concealing a dynamite stick that explodes in his face as the mice make their getaway. * Speedy sneaking out several more mice using a dachshund costume. One of the mice briefly is separated from the group, but is able to catch up, and Sylvester crashes into the fence. * Speedy using a set of train tracks and cars to bring the rest of the mice home. Sylvester tries to hide behind a tunnel along the tracks, but the train simply goes through the cat\'s body and exit through his tail. The cat cries in frustration. Here, Speedy refers to the escape as like "Atchison, Tabasco, and Santa Fe", a pun on the song On the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe. In the closing scene, Speedy is hailed as a hero and gets a big kiss from Carmella. Speedy goes wild and blasts into outer space. The other mice laugh, commenting that he is now a "loco satellite."'] ['A small homeless boy, Abush, wakes up hungry early in the morning in a small village.

Bugs finally pauses long enough to tell the audience: “Someday, they'll outlaw this annual madness known as Rabbit Season.” He hops over a stone dike, but either the ground on the other side is not firm enough to support him, or he lands with too much force. Elmer finally appears above ground and on the opposite side of the dike from Bugs wearing a frustrated expression  At the same time, Bugs is asking himself the very same question. He assumes that he has fallen into a cave possibly belonging to giant Native Americans. This assumption comes from an item on the wall with odd writing on it which Bugs takes for a powder horn. He says: “Must be Indian writing, but it's Greek to me.” (The writing briefly changes to English: reading “TIME CAPSULE &mdash; CIRCA 10,000 BC TO BE OPENED 1960 AD,” then reverts back to its original format as Bugs approaches it. He pulls on a stoppering item on the wide end that is nearly his own size, whereupon, much to his surprise, a reel of film pops out. This he transports  back to his hole and views through his own film projector. This film is described as “A Micronesian Film Documentary in Breathtaking Cro-Magnonscope. Color by Neanderthal Color.” Then the narration begins. “This is the year 10,000 B. C. This film has been made to preserve a record of our way of life. Here, good hunting defines good living.” During the opening pronouncement, a variety of clashes take place amidst the palm trees and other tropical surroundings, i.e. dinosaurs fighting each other  and a tiger and Pteranodon battling. This sequence re-uses footage from the cartoon short Caveman Inki. “Let us meet one of our most intrepid hunters. This is Elmer Fuddstone.” Fuddstone emerges from his cave and utters: “Shhhhh. Be vewy, vewy quiet. Me hunt Sabre-toothed Wabbit” &mdash; an obvious less-educated version of the modern-day Fudd's “I'm hunting wabbits” catch phrase. This statement shocks the modern Bugs, but when he asks “Sabre-toothed Rabbit?” the prehistoric documentary answers him directly via narrator: “Yes. A Sabre-toothed Rabbit. His habitat is deep in the lush jungle.” A Sabre-toothed Rabbit hole now appears on the screen &mdash; albeit covered by a rock. Its inhabitant pushes it aside, grabs his ears and hops up out of the hole , after which he munches on a carrot in Bugs' trademark fashion. The Sabre-toothed Rabbit looks very much like Bugs, but he has less-well-groomed fur and longer teeth. Bugs laughs off the possibility that he's related to him  but then asks the film directly if he is. The Sabre-toothed Rabbit also speaks like Bugs, as he answers: “Eh, could be.” Elmer Fuddstone now appears, spear in hand, and huddles low to the ground, remarking, “Sabre-toothed Wabbit come this way.” He continues on, up into a tree, where he rips a vine off one branch and ties a loop in one end like a lasso. The looped end he allows to fall to the ground, but when the prehistoric Bugs passes by, he pulls on the string and Elmer falls down. Next, the prehistoric Elmer grabs a hollow stick, into one end of which he places a poisonous berry. He says that no rabbit can make a monkey out of him, but as he prepares to blow it at Bugs, he suffers the effects of the projectile's consumption as the rabbit blows it at him first . McKimson had used a similar gag in his 1949 toon Bushy Hare. Bugs asks him: “What's up, Doc?” whereupon Elmer blasts the “tweachewous wabbit” for not allowing him to hunt him and thus provide his killer's family with clothes and food. Bugs feigns guilt and offers: “I'll help ya get me. Some smart-apple's gonna invent gunpowder someday and the gun will follow along.” This entices Fuddstone to begin developing gunpowder almost at once, and shortly thereafter he demonstrates this to Bugs. He rubs a wooden stick in a small skin bag of gunpowder, which explodes  Elmer is now high in an old tree, ashen-faced and much the worse for wear, but he maintains a triumphant look upon his face . Bugs searches for items out of which to manufacture a gun, in the end settling on the hollow stick that previously contained the toxic berry Elmer swallowed by mistake for a gunbarrel, and “a taro root for a stock.” Elmer grows impatient, but Bugs soon attaches the root to one end of the stick, pours in powder and pebbles, and hands the finished product  to his pursuer. He lights the fuse with an extremely primitive version of a cigarette lighter and tells him: “You may fire when ready.” But right before he fires, Bugs tells Fuddstone: “Oops, got this on the wrong end!” He removes the stock and plugs it into the other end of the barrel, causing Elmer to shoot himself in the face The film ends, and the present-day Bugs snickers: “And so it always has been. Those 'smart' hunters are never any match for us 'dumb' rabbits.” But right as he says this, Elmer Fudd  appears next to him and sneers: “That's what YOU think, wabbit! Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh!” However, Fudd doesn't notice that he's holding his gun so it points at him; so, repeating the 11,960-year-old mistake of his ancestor, he shoots himself. Bugs: “That's what I think! Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh!”"] ['Jackie is trying to circulate a petition among his classmates to keep school open during the summer, as he and the gang are afraid that they might lose Miss Crabtree during summer vacation.

Alfalfa tries to talk him out of his fears, but truant officer Smithers happens along to personally usher both children to school himself. Meanwhile, a husband and wife midget pair  walk out on their circus sideshow jobs. They disguise themselves as children to enjoy a day about town, but Smithers mistakes them for actual children and takes them to school. At school, the kids trudge through their Arbor Day recitals and songs (Alfalfa contributes a squeaky rendition of Joyce Kilmer\'s "Trees" set to song . When the midgets-in-disguise offer to join in the show, they contribute a shimmy routine which shocks the entire audience of faculty and parents. The circus proprietor turns up to apprehend the two midgets, who, as they are carried away back to the circus, call out to the recital audience "Come by and see a good show sometime!" Principal Cass then informs Smithers he\'s fired, to Spanky and Alfala\'s delight.'] ['The film begins off with a Star Wars styled title crawl. After the credits, the film cuts to the USS Consolationprize being attacked by a spacecraft resembling a Star Destroyer. We are then introduced to the ship\'s crew, Captain Kwirk and Mr. Spuck. A menacing figure named Dark Vapor then appears telling them that they are to be captured as part of the Rebellious Alliance. Upon realizing that the rest of the crew won\'t appear due to budget cuts, they escape in a shuttlecraft, and land on Earth, in the year 2001. They climb over a ridge to find a monolith, which belongs to a cigar-smoking Star Child. He says his monolith is broken and the universe is falling apart because of it. He states it\'s up to Kwirk and Spuck to repair it. They are also told that the dark smell of the force wants to steal the monolith for its power. But both sides can summon any warrior from any universe  to help their side of the fight. Later that night, the two arrive in Plastic City, and meet their first opponent, the Schwartzenator. In response, they summon RoboFuzz to combat him. Neither side is victorious. After that, Dark Vapor summons The Carnivore. Spuck responds by summoning N.T. the Non-Terrestrial. N.T. is the victor. Dark Vapor then summons Uglien, although he is easily distracted by an ice cream cone, which Spuck seemingly pulls out of his behind. Right as Spuck and Kwirk believe that they are victorious, the monolith is stolen by Darth Vapor\'s henchman, Mini-Maul , flying his Bow-Tie Fighter. Kwirk and Spuck secretly follow him onto Dark Vapor\'s starship, where a fight ensues. Meanwhile, Kwirk\'s mechanic, Mr. Squatty realizes the monolith\'s battery died and it just needed a jump start. The monolith is then repaired, and Captain Kwirk dispatches Mini-Maul by knocking him down into a pit of what appears to be liquid feces. Meanwhile, Mr. Spuck dispatches the rest of Vapor\'s henchmen in an asteroid field with a 12-gauge shotgun. Kwirk is reunited on the Consolationprize with Spuck, and he makes the discovery that the enemies\' designation is pure gas. They dispatch Dark Vapor by launching a missile into his ship. With evil now vanquished, Captain Kwirk wonders why RoboFuzz and N.T. have not been returned to their respective universes. The Star Child then appears on their screen, and informs them that they have yet to battle the true evil, and to defeat it they must unite with their enemies. Kwirk, Spuck, Vapor, and Mini-Maul are then transported to a desert wasteland, where they meet Jar Jar Sucks. For a reason they can\'t explain, they all suddenly feel pure hatred toward him, and attack. They tie him up with his own tongue, and throw him over a cliff. The Star Child then informs them that their duties are done, and they are sent back to their respective universes, "until the sequel".'] ['As the opening credits roll the film begins with shots of the infamous Milorad Ulemek, then commander of the Serbian police Special Operations Unit who was later convicted for the 2003 assassination of Prime Minister Zoran Đinđić, inspecting troops. Ulemek is not mentioned by name as he was still very much unknown to the general public at the time. The narrator sets the tone by informing the audience that although Serbia was not directly and officially involved in the Yugoslav wars, Serbia very much felt the effects: country is under the United Nations trade embargo, the inflation rate is skyrocketing, streets of Serbian cities are flooded with weapons, and the brain drain is in full swing with young professionals leaving abroad. At the same time many local career criminals plying their trade in Western Europe have returned home to take advantage of the chaotic situation. To further its point, the narration refers to the heinous crime that occurred on 1 December 1993 in Novi Beograd in Belgrade. Two returnees from the frontlines, Ilija Vujić and Darko Lončarić, broke into the apartment at Pohorska Street inhabited by Verica Židić and her 13-year-old son Davor. Vujić shot the mother in the liver, a technique he learned in the war that apparently allows the victim to live a little longer before succumbing, in order to have enough time to question her about her savings they were after. He then proceeded to kill her son as well. Belgrade police inspector Ljuba Milovanović is then interviewed about the gruesome double murder. He says that during questioning, Vujić\'s response to their question as to why he killed the son was: "Fuck the kid, he was supposed to be in school at that time of day, anyway". Narrator then says that before being apprehended by police, Vujić and Lončarić had recounted their crime in detail in a packed Belgrade cafe. None of the cafe guests who had heard the story found it necessary to call the police. In the end, Vujić received the death penalty.However, while waiting on the death row, he was pardoned by Serbian president Milan Milutinović because in the meantime the death penalty had been abolished in Serbia. Vujić\'s punishment was switched to 40 years in prison, which he has been serving since late 1993 in a high-security prison near Požarevac.http://mtsmondo.com/news/vesti/text.php?vest=79265 The movie then shifts to interviews with various Belgrade gangsters. While some of them act through close-knit criminal clans, others seem to be freelancers. Many of them have also done work for the Serbian state security agencies. War-struck Serbia is a frustrated nation. Young people realise that their future offers them only poverty, uncertainty and fear. As in many cities of ex-communist countries in which the standard of living fell rapidly, the young are easily tempted by money and glamour, things available to gang members. In the words of Bane Grebenarević: "Every young man in Serbia dreams of becoming a member of a gang for five minutes in his life". The same person adds that "Mortals  will not experience in their entire life what one of us experiences in one day." It is a generation that wants it all and it wants it now. Their idols are notorious criminals such as Carlos the Jackal and Željko Ražnatović. They acknowledge the fact that criminal activity in Serbia has not reached Western standards because of "lack of professionalism". They explain how things work and assess the positive and negative aspects of the criminal profession in the country. It is an unusual and disquieting opportunity for the viewer to peer into the underworld of the Balkans. The last scenes - the funerals of three of the people who had been interviewed and were killed during the shooting of the film - remind viewers that what they have seen and heard, no matter how unbelievable it may have seemed, is real. It is a documentary based on an original idea, rarely seen in the past and its immediacy make it compelling viewing.'] ['A large bird\'s-eye view of a city is shown with beams of light moving to a conga beat. The action takes place in the famed Ciro\'s nightclub, where the Hollywood stars are having dinner - at $50  a plate and "easy terms". The first stars seen are Claudette Colbert, Don Ameche and, at a table behind them, Adolphe Menjou and Norma Shearer, followed by Cary Grant, seated alone. Grant talks to himself: “What a place! What a place! It’s as pretty as a picture. But if I ever told my favorite wife the awful truth I\'d land right on the front page. Yessireee Bobby.” (All these jokes are references to some of his films, except [[The Front Page . Then Greta Garbo comes along selling "cigars, cigarettes, butts." Grant buys some, tossing a quarter  into her tray and asks her for a light. Garbo lifts her enormous foot on the table and strikes a match on the shoe, then lights Grant’s cigarette. Garbo is considered even today to have been an extremely beautiful woman, but she did have very large feet, and this was caricatured repeatedly in Warner Brothers cartoons of the era [Moreover, this is especially funny in Brazil, where lesbians are referred as "sapatão" . Garbo may really have been bisexual]. In the next scene Edward G. Robinson asks Ann Sheridan: "How’s the Oomph girl tonight?" Sheridan responds by uttering the word "Oomph" several times. Her final "Oomph" surprises Robinson.  The camera then tracks past some tables: the first one has Henry Binder and Leon Schlesinger sitting there as an in-joke, while the soundtrack quotes "Merrily We Roll Along" - the theme to the Merrie Melodies series.  The camera shows some other tables which are reserved for people: Bette Davis, a large sofa for Kate Smith , and the last table isn\'t reserved for movie actors at all, but for comic  characters: Blondie, Dagwood, and Baby Dumpling, with a fire hydrant for Daisy the dog. Meanwhile, in the cloakroom Johnny Weissmuller has arrived. He leaves his overcoat behind to reveal his Tarzan outfit - with the single addition of tuxedo collar and black tie. Sally Rand , leaves her trademark feather "fans" behind and leaves presumably naked, as only her hands are seen and not her entire self-figure.The hatcheck girl is Paulette Goddard. In the next scene James Cagney informs Humphrey Bogart and George Raft that they must prepare to do something risky. The trio, all known for their “tough guy” roles, get ready, turn, and start pitching pennies. Harpo Marx, usually the prankster in the Marx Brothers films, sticks some matches under Garbo\'s foot, then lights it. Garbo reacts very slowly and coolly to the pain, in contrast to her serene and cool acting style by slowly saying, "Ouuchhh." Then Clark Gable spots a girl, whom he follows with his head turning around 180 degrees . After this, Bing Crosby announces the first act that evening. During his speech he is interrupted by a jockey on a race horse . Crosby then introduces the first musical number by conductor Leopold Stokowski. Stokowski, seen with a snood containing his long hair, prepares himself dramatically and seriously to conducting what looks to be a classical orchestral arrangement. However, it’s the conga "Ahí, viene la conga" that he conducts, moving rhythmically to the beat as he does so. The beat “does something” to Dorothy Lamour, who is seen sitting at a table with James Stewart. She begs him to go dancing with her. Stewart starts stuttering and hesitating, but in the end agrees to follow her to the dance floor.  When she moves her body to the beat he gets scared and runs away, leaving a sign reading Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, the title of one of his best-known films at that time. The next shot shows Gable again, moving to the beat and at the same time following the girl he saw earlier. Tyrone Power dances with Sonja Henie , who is still wearing her ice skates. Frankenstein\'s monster is dancing very stiffly and woodenly. The Three Stooges poke and smash each other in rhythm to the beat, a reference to their famous “poke in the eye” slapstick films. Oliver Hardy dances with someone as well and is shown from the back. When he turns his face to the camera he is revealed to be dancing with two girls at the same time; a double reference to Hardy\'s "ladies man" routine within the Laurel and Hardy series and also to his obesity. Cesar Romero, known for his roles as a Latin lover, dances with Rita Hayworth in another sendup or tease. The two are shown in the long shot to be dancing with almost spastic in-coordination. In reality, Hayworth and Romero were both considered to be excellent dancers. The camera then cuts to Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland sitting at a table. The waiter brings an expensive bill, which shocks Rooney. He asks his “father”, Judge Hardy , for a favor. In the next scene both are seen washing the dishes to the conga beat . Gable is shown still following the girl. Then Crosby introduces the final act, again interrupted by the same jockey on his race horse. Sally Rand  performs the bubble dance  to "I\'m Forever Blowing Bubbles", a famous scene from her film Bolero, in complete nudity, which is never seen although parts of her body get revealed. Kay Kyser  is shown dressed in his "Professor" Square academic cap. He is excited by the act and shouts out: “Students!”  A group of people look, whistle in unison and exclaim: “Baby!” They are William Powell, Spencer Tracy, Gilbert Roland and Errol Flynn. Sitting down are Wallace Beery and C. Aubrey Smith. Peter Lorre, known for his portrayal of sinister and weird characters, says dreamingly: “I haven\'t seen such a beautiful bubble since I was a child.” This is a possible reference to Lorre\'s breakthrough film role in Europe, a movie titled "M", in which Lorre played a murderous child molester. Henry Fonda enjoys the act too, but is pulled away by his mother. This is a reference to the popular radio show The Aldrich Family which always opened with the cry: "Hen-RYYYYY! Henry Aldrich!" by the mother of the teenage title character, Henry Aldrich, who always replied, "Coming, Mother!" J. Edgar Hoover says “Gee!” several times as a pun to his function as G-man. Boris Karloff, Arthur Treacher, Buster Keaton and Mischa Auer watch the spectacle without any emotion . Ned Sparks, another famous movie "grouch" asks them if they are having a good time. They all respond dryly: “Yes.” Jerry Colonna reacts in excitement to the act and utters his catchphrases “Guess who?”, and the camera reveals an invisible character next to him: “Yehudi!”  The camera zooms back to Strand lifting up her bubble, whereupon the camera follows the bubble with Sally out of sight, thus never revealing the nude dancer, and the bubble comes back down again and Sally catches it and she is once again holding the bubble in front of her. Finally Harpo Marx shoots the bubble with a slingshot. The bubble explodes and Sally Rand is shown wearing a barrel underneath. She reacts with shock, and the curtains close to signify the end of the dance. The conga stops and the cartoon cuts to Gable who has finally caught the girl he was chasing, insisting she kiss him. "She" turns out to be Groucho Marx in drag -- "Well, fancy meeting you here!"'] ["Bugs Bunny is exploring Dark Africa. A short witch doctor  wants to use him as a key ingredient in a prescription.

Finally, Ed proposes the idea of dental floss to Oral-B. The CEO rejects it, saying "The wheel\'s already been invented, mate!" The CEO too, has never heard of it. In desperation, Ed purchases some candles, which he begins to strip down in order to use the wax-covered string inside as dental floss.

Roughing Vane over, Reilly discovers he has taken a missing persons case in which an insurance company is trying to locate someone by the name of Alex Pleshette. However when Reilly presents himself to the insurance office to drop the case, the owner Max Arnett claims he never hired his agency to begin with. On the way out however, Arnett\'s receptionist inadvertently gives away the truth that Reilly was in fact hired... Heading back to his office, Reilly is confronted by two thugs in an alley who beat him and tell him to lay off the Pleshette case. In his office a short time later a beautiful young woman in black arrives. Presenting herself as Mrs. Pleshette, Reilly assumes she is Alex Pleshette\'s wife, however she curtly informs him that her husband is dead, and that she is actually Alexandra, better known as Alex Pleshette. She tells him to stop interfering as she is now no longer missing, and departs ... leaving him even more confused. Next day Reilly finds out from his police detective friend Jack Bosley that Alex Pleshette witnessed the murder of her husband, a wealthy tycoon named Donald Pleshette who was at the time being investigated for company insurance fraud. However she was knocked unconscious by the killer and as a result is unable to remember the event. Not long after this she went missing and no one knew where she was, not even her lover Gabe Preston, her husband\'s disgruntled business partner. Reilly recognizes that Preston would thus have a motive for murder, but Bosley explains that he has a strong alibi. Later, Reilly gives Vane a camera and instructs him to follow Arnett and take photos of anything that appears interesting. Meanwhile he drives to the Pleshette mansion on Noir Drive to confront Alex. She concedes that although she was bitter towards her husband as a result of the fraud allegations against him, she had no proof that her husband was even involved in the fraud, and that even if she did she couldn\'t disclose them because of the legal principal of marital privilege, whereby spouses cannot testify against each other. They are then interrupted by the arrival of Gabe Preston ... Alex introduces them before promptly leading Reilly out of the house. On his way out Reilly explains to Alex that whoever hired him did so on the instruction of her husband\'s killer, worried that she may regain her memory at any time, and wanting her close by if she did. Reilly says he believes she knows more than she realises, but she replies "at times we all want to be kept in the dark". Back at his office, Reilly looks through the photos taken by Vane, and in one sees Max Arnett meeting up with Gabe Preston! He promptly calls Bosley who confirms that Preston\'s alibi was in fact Arnett. Reilly rushes off to the Pleshette mansion but Preston and Alex have left for good... Far way on a tropical island resort, Preston and Alex lounge back on a beach. Alex however is unsettled ... her memory then triggered by the pop of the champagne cork ... and she realises it was Gabe Preston who murdered her husband! Looking down to reveal to us the wedding ring she now wears as Mrs. Alex Preston, it occurs to her that Preston now not only has access to the entire fortune, but that she is unable to testify against him because of marital privilege.'] ['The story begins much like the classic fairy tale, with Red Riding Hood off to see her grandmother, who lives in the woods. The present she plans to bring her grandmother is Tweety . Sylvester sees Red\'s cargo and immediately begins going after her, his primary interest being Tweety. Red boards the bus, but Sylvester continues after her as it drives into the woods, the inattentive cat striking a road sign along the way. In the woods, the Big Bad Wolf — rougher looking in appearance than in later shorts — waits for Red to come by. A sign announces who Big Bad is, much to his disgust.

Upon the arrival of the bird, Sylvester pretends to play nice in order to abuse and eventually make a meal of the pretending-to-be-naive canary. A series of violent visual gags ensues in which Tweety physically subdues the threatening cat by smoking him up, hitting him on the foot with a mallet, feeding him some alum and using his uvula as a punching bag.   A couple of racial/ethnic gags are included. Sylvester imitates a Scandinavian-sounding maid, who feigns complaining about having to "clean out de bird cage." He reaches into the covered cage and grabs what he thinks is the bird. The canary whistles at him. The confused cat opens his fist to find a small bomb, which promptly explodes, covering the cat in "blackface" makeup. His voice pattern then changes to something sounding like "Rochester", and he says, "Uh-oh, back to the kitchen, ah smell somethin\' burnin\'!" just before passing out. A more subtle gag with a racist legacy occurs when Tweety, inside the cat\'s mouth, yells down its gullet. The answer comes back, "There\'s nobody here but us mice!" This is a variant on an old joke in which a black man is hiding in a henhouse, and when the farmer yells who is there, the would-be chicken thief answers, "Dey\'s nobody here but us chickens!"

Overhearing the woman telling the pet shop that the cat will have a nice home here, Tweety reveals the silhouette of a cat now stencilled on the wall, and closes the cartoon with a comment to the camera, "Her don\'t know me very well, do her?" a variant on one of Red Skelton\'s catchphrases by his "Mean Widdle Kid" character from radio.'] ['Betty flies to Japan to do a show, and sings the title number.

Tom feels his head and Jerry dances out of the way. He deals out all the food a second time, and this time taps a nail into each one. Jerry merely attracts them all with a magnet.

As Sambo goes out to play, the dog sneaks out the window with a fiendish idea. He uses undried brown paint on a fence for stripes and a paint brush for them on his tail. He sees his teeth, and finds a bear trap to resemble sharp teeth. He tests his appearance in a mirror and walks away, although it was an actual tiger. Sambo is whistling, as the dog is hiding in a tree, sneaking on him. The dog follows him, until Sambo runs away. He finally hides on a coconut tree, and throws coconuts at him, until he grabs a monkey\'s ear, who throws him out to the ground. Then, the dog tells Sambo that he is not a tiger. Then, Sambo plays fetch, and when the dog retrieves, the real tiger appears, and chases them home. They block the door, and the tiger uses a rock to reproduce a banging sound. He creeps in the house, and they use molasses to trap him. Sambo grabs a skillet and burns the tiger, and he is chased away.'] ['The short opens in the town of Canasta Flats in 1889 and the camera pulls past the Last Chance Saloon and the Next To The Last Chance Saloon and pulls into the Fat Chance Saloon, where the patrons are hanging out. A mustached cowboy tells his friend that he hears that Yosemite Sam is in town, to which his friend flees . Sam enters the saloon and states who he is, until he gets interrupted by a voice telling him to shut up. When Sam comes up to the pink shirt cowboy who stayed and demands to know who told him to shut up, the cowboy reveals himself to be Bugs Bunny, who admits he said it. When Sam tells Bugs that his backtalk has led him to a duel, Bugs shuns Sam for his bad breath. Sam then warns Bugs he will get shot and that he\'s a sharp shooter. Bugs, however, informs Sam he\'s a sharp shooter as well. To prove it, he tells Sam a shot he\'s good at, and fires a bullet that ricochet\'s off various objects before parting Sam\'s head down the middle. After Sam sees the bullet come in, he ducks and tells Bugs he missed, but when Bugs tells him to wait, Sam\'s hat falls off in half, revealing parted hair. Unimpressed at this skill of sharp shooting, Sam shows Bugs some real shooting by tossing a can in the air and shooting it full of holes. To top it, Bugs tosses the same can up, but shoots Sam in the face instead. When Sam threatens to blast Bugs for that "accident," Bugs suggests that they settle things "in a gentleman-like manner", to which Sam agrees to, even though its against his principles They begin the typical ten-pace and fire, only with Bugs going the same way Sam does, when Sam cheats in the count . Sam turns to fire, but fires directly past Bugs, who then kisses him on the nose. After Bugs does it again, Sam calls off the "Gentlemen\'s Duel" and forces Bugs to fight "dirty", so they each go to opposite ends of a bar shooting at each other. As Sam goes to one end, Bugs blasts him in the face, and when Sam tries to return, Bugs outruns and blasts him again. Unfortunately, their fight is interrupted when Sam hears a train whistle. Seeing that its 5:15, Sam tells Bugs that he\'s cutting the gunfight short so that he can catch and rob the train. Just as Sam hops aboard his horse and rides off after the train, Bugs follows on another horse. Sam orders Bugs at gunpoint to go back so he can rob the train, but Bugs vows that he\'s going to save the train. Right after Bugs hops aboard the train and switches his cowboy hat with a train engineer\'s cap, Sam orders Bugs back at the count of five. Just as Sam reaches four, his horse makes him hit a telegraph pole. When Sam catches up again and tries counting to three, but when he gets to two, he runs into the wall of a tunnel. He catches up again and tries just counting to two, but when he says two, he and his horse fall off a trestle bridge and into a river below. Sam, however, rides on ahead of Bugs and boards a green-painted steam locomotive with a tender . Thinking this will make Bugs stop, Sam calls out to Bugs to stop his train because he\'s got one of his own . Bugs, instead, calls out to Sam to stop his train. Both openly state that neither will stop their train unless the other stops his first. Thinking Bugs wants to play dirty, Sam tells Bugs they\'ll see who stops their train first when they crash and advances the regulator in his train. Bugs accepts this duel and advances the regulator in his train. As both trains rush towards each other head on, Sam keeps a stern face and Bugs remains calm. Almost to collision, Sam considers blowing his train\'s whistle, but instead ducks down to wait for the crash. Bugs, however, extends the "legs" on his train so that Sam\'s passes harmlessly underneath. Just as Sam gets up and wonders why there was no crash, he spots a sign reading "End of Line" and his train falls off an unfinished trestle bridge and into a lake below. Bugs then calls out a goodbye to Sam and drives off to St. Louis. The final shot shows Sam\'s train, up to its smokestack in the lake. Sam pokes out of the smokestack and openly admits that he hates Bugs to the audience.'] ["Oswald goes to a dental clinic for treatment to his cavity problem.

During patrol, the Dynamic Duo spots her trying to stop one of Penguin\'s shipments on Gotham\'s interstate, using a plasma rifle to send the Penguin\'s truck with its driver off the bridge. Batman and Robin saves the driver from falling to his death. Batman must figure out who Batwoman is and stop familiar enemies, the Penguin and Rupert Thorne, from selling illegal weapons to the fictional nation of Kasnia. The two employ Carlton Duquesne, a gangster, to provide protection. Batwoman\'s main focus is on illegal activity by the Penguin, Thorne, and Duquesne. Despite taking the symbol of the Bat as a sign of justice, Batwoman sullies the Bat prefix by taking out criminals with ruthless and dangerous techniques. She seems uninterested in sparing the lives of her adversaries. Batman, with Robin, sets out to stop the Batwoman from making mistakes as she tries to take out the villains, and as he encounters numerous twists, setbacks, and apparent false leads in determining her true identity. The newest gadget on display is a wind glider used by Batwoman that utilizes some of the most advanced technology ever seen in Gotham City. Bruce Wayne, Batman\'s alter ego, also becomes involved with a new lady in his life: Kathy Duquesne, the crime boss\'s daughter. In addition to Kathy Duquesne, Bruce is introduced to two other women who, as his investigation into the Batwoman\'s true identity continues, seem to fall well into suspicion: Dr. Roxanne "Rocky" Ballantine, a new employee of Wayne Tech whose technology development is used by the Batwoman against the Penguin; and Detective Bullock\'s new partner Sonya Alcana, whose knowledge of the weapons being smuggled by the Penguin and Carlton Dunquesne is much greater than the detective should know. With Carlton Duquesne unable to stop Batwoman\'s raids on the various facilities used to hold the various weapons, the Penguin calls Bane for additional support to ensure that there are no more losses as a result of the Batwoman. Not long after Bane\'s arrival in Gotham, it is revealed that there is not one but three Batwomen, all of whom were the women suspected by Batman; Kathy and Sonia met taking art classes at college and Sonia and Rocky were roommates. They had taken turns to remove suspicion on any one of the three, while using Roxanne\'s technological genius and contempt for the Penguin , Kathy\'s money and access to several key aspects of her father\'s organization , and Sonia\'s physical and police skills to ensure that Thorne\'s operation is thwarted . Alcana was also saved by Batman nine years prior, the event giving the detective the original inspiration for the costumed identity she now shares with her friends. In the final confrontation, a ship taking the weapons into international waters for the exchange is destroyed by a bomb planted by Kathy. She and Batman narrowly escape the explosion despite the efforts of Bane, who falls into the Gotham River and vanishes. At the conclusion, the GCPD are left to assume that Sonia is the only Batwoman after she helps rescue Batman from the ship. Sonia resigns from the police due to the potential problems her presence could cause and decides to leave the city. Batman gives Sonia evidence he discovered which helps clear Rocky\'s fiance. Carlton agrees to testify against Thorne and the Penguin after saving Kathy\'s life during the ship\'s destruction. After she reconciles with her father, Kathy drives off with Bruce.'] ['The plot is based on an anti-war military science fiction story by Sever Gansovsky.

The king is sleeping peacefully in his bed, then Jerry and Tuffy climb a nearby table. However, Tuffy loses his balance and grabs Jerry\'s outfit, but cannot keep from falling. Jerry looks at where Tuffy fell, but then Tuffy pops up behind Jerry and scares him. Jerry is miffed, but Tuffy explains in French what happened. Jerry shushes him and motions for the little mouse to follow. Jerry jumps into a wedge of cheese and looks through the holes. He keeps stealthy as he spears a bit of cheese on his sword. Then, he sees Tuffy has speared a grape, which bounces into the king\'s mouth. The king\'s mouth starts to inflate as he suffocates, but Jerry causes the grape to be swallowed safely down his throat. Jerry runs away and motions again for Tuffy to follow, but Tuffy runs into a teacup and breaks it, waking up the king with a start. The king glares at Tuffy, and then Jerry stabs him in the nose.

Tom spots some champagne corks and then hears mysterious clanking. A suit of armor is being used as a puppet, and it dances noisily. Jerry raises the visor and sees only Tom, standing nonchalantly next to the suit. He gestures toward the king, whose ears are plugged with the corks, and then slices apart the suit of armor. Jerry dodges while Tuffy escapes and plugs the king\'s nose with clothespins, which causes his face to bloat again. Tom has caught Jerry on the end of his blade, but Jerry points at the king, and Tom can only watch as the clothespins and corks are blown off and the king wakes up. Tom plays a soothing violin tune to cause the king to fall asleep again. Tom chases the mice outside, then locks all the doors and swallows the key so that they cannot get back in. However, they shoot an arrow through the keyhole into Tom\'s backside. Tom tries to hold his scream of pain in until he can get outside, but with no way to get outside, Tom can\'t help but let his scream out inside the room.

Tuffy says: "C\'est la guerre."  during the break and resume his fight.'] ["The movie includes scenes from numerous shuttle missions, beginning with footage of a de-orbiting  Challenger  on its approach to the Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral, complete with sonic boom. Mission STS-41-C, the 11th for the shuttle program and the fifth for Challenger is featured most heavily, beginning with the deployment of the Long Duration Exposure Facility  satellite. The capture and repair of the Solar Max satellite also receives a great deal of coverage, including a detailed overview of training for the mission in a large pool at NASA. This particular mission is of interest, as the first attempt at capturing the satellite failed, and a second attempt almost 12 hours later had to be made. That portion of the mission was a success, with the satellite being brought to the payload bay on the next attempt, and was repaired quickly by astronauts James van Hoften and George Nelson. Other STS 41-C mission activities included a student experiment located in a middeck locker to determine how honeybees make honeycomb cells in a microgravity environment. Other shuttle missions are interspersed during the feature with the STS-41-C footage. Highlights include: * STS-41-D: The first launch of Discovery, with footage of liftoff, the deployment of two of the three satellites on this mission, and special attention given to the novelty of the experimental OAST-1 solar array, which was a precursor to the solar arrays of the International Space Station.  Footage is also shown of Discoverys landing and transport from its landing site at Edwards Air Force Base to Kennedy Space Center on the back of the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft. * STS-41-G: The sixth flight of Challenger, notable as the largest crew aboard the shuttle at that time, the first time two women flew together on the shuttle, and the first spacewalk by an American woman, Kathy Sullivan. Footage of Hurricane Josephine is also shown. Additionally, a small amount of time is also dedicated to other aspects of the shuttle program, including: * Other crew that work on the shuttle; * The work of inspecting and replacing the shuttle's heat tiles; * Training the astronauts must complete to prepare for missions; * What the astronauts eat on spaceflights; * How astronauts would bail out if an emergency occurred on the launch pad.  The movie was produced and shot 15-18 months before the Challenger disaster, and includes appearances by the shuttle Challenger itself, and two astronauts, Francis Scobee and Judith Resnik, who died in the accident."] ['Stan and Ollie are ordered to wash the dishes by Ollie\'s wife but Stan dries them and puts them back in the bowl.

James Finlayson then calls to collect payment for some furniture. Stan, Ollie and Mrs Hardy embark on a lengthy "the money that you gave to him, to give to me to pay him" dialogue routine. At Stan\'s suggestion Ollie then withdraws the couple\'s savings from the bank to buy furniture and inadvertently pays virtually the whole amount at an auction for a grandfather clock which is soon crushed under a passing truck. Awaiting the wrath of Mrs Hardy back at home he tells Stan that "here is another nice kettle of fish you\'ve pickled me in". Mrs Hardy then causes serious injuries to Ollie when she hits him over the head with a frying pan, requiring him to be rushed to hospital for a blood transfusion.

It is clear that the narration is a poem, which the poet is typing on a typewriter. In the beginning, we are introduced to his city\'s love of music and musical prowess. The poet singles out one female singer of whom he is clearly enamored, quoting her singing as "A voice that made all the angels of eternity sound ... tone deaf". Shortly afterwards we are introduced to an overbearing structure beyond the sea, appearing to be a lighthouse. Its light quickly goes out, foreshadowing malevolence. Singers and musicians begin to disappear into thin air, "Like sailors lost at sea". As police investigate the missing cats, they find human shoeprints. The main character begins to explain the Cat Piano and its terrible function. We are informed that the Cat Piano is an instrument, much like any ordinary piano or harpsichord. The terrible reality is that instead of using strings and hammers to produce the desired noise, the Cat Piano produces noise by striking a nail into the tails of one or more cats that are caged in the piano. Immediately after discovering this, the main character rushes to warn the female singer, and arrives seconds too late. His heart broken, the city falls to pieces around him, fights break out, and music becomes forbidden. For a short while, the poet is tortured of thoughts of The Cat Piano, and can\'t get the sounds of screaming cats out of his head. He motions shooting himself with his hand, and with the word "Snap", we are shown a glimpse of what appears to be a nightmare. In this nightmare, a dark humanoid figure holds up a cage with the afformentioned female singer and pricks her with a needle. The poet wakes up in a cold sweat and decides to take action. He observes the lighthouse from a hill, which now casts a red beam of light, and he can hear the terrible screams of the cats from a distance. A makeshift army of the city\'s citizens is shown behind him. He and the army head over to the lighthouse in boats, and upon their arrival begin to scale the lighthouse. They break into the lighthouse, and we are given a glimpse of the mad pianist. The instrument he is playing resembles more of an organ than a piano, but nevertheless it is a terrifying torture machine equipped with hundreds of needles. The poet meets eyes with the singer, who is placed at the very top of the organ. The man playing the organ turns around, and the army of cats attacks him. They bite, scratch, and claw at him until he stumbles out of a window and falls to his death. They free the imprisoned cats, set fire to the lighthouse, and leave with the prisoners for home. The mood immediately becomes lighthearted again, as the city regains its artistic merit.

Tom barely misses the mouse and ends up diving himself. Jerry makes a successful dive, and the elephant happens to come by and drink all the water, taking Jerry away with it. Tom, still in midair, sees the empty bowl and points down in dismay before impact. Tom crashes through the ground with such force he falls all the way into hell. A devil takes him back up to the surface and throws him out, as if to say that it is not yet Tom\'s time. The elephant is now back in its stable playing with Jerry, throwing him up into the air and then sucking him back to its trunk. Tom sticks out a stick with a pepper shaker on one end and shakes pepper into the elephant\'s snout. It elicits a gigantic sneeze which throws Jerry miles and miles from the circus. Tom runs backwards with a baseball glove to catch the mouse, but somehow the elephant has come near Tom. He runs up the elephant\'s leg and perches himself to catch the mouse, but the elephant rolls up its trunk and throws the cat off him. It then catches the glove and also catches Jerry, and proceeds to hug the mouse again. Jerry and the elephant are now leading the circus parade, with Jerry playing the bugle and the elephant playing a very loud drum which causes the cymbals to rise and then crash together. Tom hides in a manhole to create violence at the parade by putting a dynamite on the road so it will explode when the elephant stomps on the switch. However, the crashing pushes the dynamite stick back with Tom as he closes the manhole, without knowing it. The elephant steps on the switch and Tom meets exploding defeat and waves a "The End" flag.'] ['The uniquely serious Schlesinger-produced cartoon retells the origins of the United States of America.

Jerry\'s spirit catches its host and then gets its revenge on a laughing Tom. The mere sight of the "ghost" causes Tom to turn white; then it returns to its host body. Jerry recovers and runs off as Tom recovers by shaking it off. Tom chases the mouse up a series of work steps and into the air, where somehow they still chase in a zigzag pattern until Jerry stops him and points to the empty abyss. Tom panics and falls through the piped balcony, splitting himself into pieces in mid-air, but they re-form the cat when they hit the ground. Jerry zigzags back down to comparatively solid ground and jumps through a water duct, but Tom sees him and locates himself at the bottom, intending to swallow the mouse. Jerry is traveling so fast that he bursts through Tom and opens his tail. Tom then ties the end of his tail and pursues the mouse. Jerry takes the chase out to the street and the chase is stopped by a red light to allow "traffic" which consists of other ongoing cat-mouse chases to pass.

Jerry spots Tom and manages to reach the outside of the manhole cover such that he hits Tom\'s nose upon every revolution. Tom clutches his nose in pain, but ends up dropping the manhole cover on his own foot. Tom lets out a loud bellow, and dances around in pain and sees that his toes are flattened. Jerry fakes sympathy for Tom and offers to inflate his toes with an air compressor, but Jerry goes beyond that and inflates the whole of Tom, then releases him. Tom is launched high in the air, then runs out of air and falls back down. He falls into a pair of pajamas and is thrown back up to the top of the building, catching a feather boa and a lady\'s hat from a clothesline on the way back up. A male cat pursues Tom and kisses him while he recites French poetry. Jerry plays a violin as he watches. Tom discovers Jerry, beats up the alley cat and flees.

Wellington Wimpy in tow. Sindbad orders his huge Roc, Rokh, to kidnap Popeye\'s girlfriend, Olive Oyl, and challenges the one-eyed sailor to a series of obstacles to prove his greatness, including fighting Rokh, a two-headed giant named Boola , and Sindbad himself. Popeye makes short work of the bird and the giant, but Sindbad almost gets the best of him until Popeye produces his can of spinach, which gives him the power to soundly defeat Sindbad and proclaim himself "the most remarkable, extraordinary fella." A subtly dark running gag features the hamburger-loving Wimpy chasing after a duck on the island with a meat grinder, with the intention of grinding it up so that he can fry it into his favorite dish, but the duck not only escapes, but also snatches away Wimpy\'s last burger in retaliation when he gives up.

His first attempt goes horribly wrong when his pole gets stuck in a chipmunk\'s hole, and when he goes to try again the bee stings him just as he begins his run-up.

Wallace gets up to prepare tea with cheese and crackers, only to discover they are out of cheese. Wallace suggests they should go somewhere where there is plenty of cheese. After browsing possible destinations , they ultimately choose to go to the Moon, since "everybody knows the moon\'s made of cheese." The two build a moon rocket in their basement, complete with easy chairs and a wallpapered cabin. Once the two complete packing provisions for the journey, Wallace lights the rocket\'s fuse. With only a minute to go in the countdown, he realizes that they have forgotten to pack crackers. He rushes out of the rocket and hurries up to the kitchen to get crackers, making it back to the rocket a few seconds before the engine ignites. Even with the engine running, the rocket refuses to lift off . Gromit realizes he has forgotten to release the hand brake and does so, allowing the rocket to lift off.

Mysto\'s tricks primarily come from his magic wand, which can summon flowers and rabbits. Poochini emphatically says "NO!", kicking Mysto out the door into the alley. While on the ground, Mysto plays with his magic wand and realizes he can pass it off as a conductor\'s baton, being further inspired by seeing himself in place of the conductor in a promotional poster outside the door.

Mysto\'s revenge gets more brutal as he throws a cymbal on Poochini\'s head, turning him Chinese , then transforming him into a country singer. After levitating Poochini to the ceiling and slamming him down to the stage, Mysto turns him into a square dance caller. Poochini actually continues his performance for a good 20 seconds after this without interruption, except for the "hair gag".

Franklin is sent to England as part of a colonial attempt to reason with the king, but the mission is a failure. Franklin says, "The King was unreasonable. He wouldn\'t listen."

The captain is caught in a embarrassing situation caused by a combination of the monotonous, hot dreary surroundings, not grasping the workings of the Foreign Legion, and his smoldering desire created by his wife's lustful love letters, all of which is befuddled by his use of drugs."] ['The opening frame depicts the exterior of Bugs\' dressing room, inside which he is talking to the journalist, Lolly , about his great film career, albeit rather modestly .{{Or}} Outside of Bugs\' room, lowly Warners studio janitor Daffy  eavesdrops on Bugs\' conversation and is disgusted (. "Listen to that ham [Bugs] putting it on," he snarls. "If a long eared rabbit can be a star, so can a duck!" Daffy then marches into the casting director\'s  office just as he is on the phone with another executive discussing the difficulty in finding anyone "stupid enough" to be Bugs\' stunt double for his next picture. "Hang up," Daffy triumphantly tells the boss, who in a low voice tells his colleague on the phone, "I think I\'ve found a pigeon." Daffy hears that comment and tells the boss that, "I\'m a duck. D-U-K, duck. Loaded with talent." The boss grants Daffy the role without elaborating about its stunt double status. After a visit to the Make-Up Department, Daffy gets his first taste of on-the-set film action shortly thereafter  Bugs walks onto the set when the director says “Rrrroll \'em” in a German accent . Customary carrot in hand, Bugs says his catch phrase: “Eh, what\'s up, Doc?” to which Sam growls: “All right, rabbit! Say your prayers! I\'m a-gonna blast ya!” However, right at this moment, the director announces “Cut! Brrring in the double!” Initially, Daffy is extremely excited to be finally in any motion picture. He takes Bugs\' place in a rabbit costume and holding a carrot, and stands next to Sam, whereupon they repeat the “What\'s up Doc?” / “I\'m a-gonna blast ya!” exchange &mdash; only the director doesn\'t announce “Cut!” again. Instead, he lets Daffy continue the picture; he forgets his next line and has to look back at his script to see that it\'s “I dare you!” Sam shoots Daffy in the face; a large number of his feathers, as well as his beak, fall off. Daffy quickly hollers for “MAKE-UP!” Next, Bugs is in a scene where Elmer Fudd is cast in his usual role as trying to hunt Bugs. Bugs is high in a tree, and Elmer is supposed to climb it to saw the branch Bugs is sitting on, off . However, Daffy has other ideas. He tells Elmer to come closer to him, as he has something to tell him. Lacking a clue to Daffy\'s actual motive, Elmer shuffles closer to Daffy, who whacks him in the head to knock him out. Daffy dresses up like Elmer and grabs his saw. When the director says, “Camera ... ACTION!” Bugs responds by telling "Elmer", “Remember Elmer you are not supposed to cut all the way through.” However, with a maliciously insane laugh, not Elmer but Daffy climbs the tree and jeers, “You\'re gonna be a FALLING star,” and saws right through the limb. However, unbeknownst to the greedy duck, Bugs was safe all along; his limb was attached to a telephone pole, so the rest of the tree comes crashing down. The director says "Ok, Print it!" despite the complications. After this sequence, Bugs is fishing off a pier. Daffy shows up and snaps “AHA! Tryin\' to hog all the easy scenes for yourself, eh? I\'LL handle this one.” Bugs protests, but Daffy takes no notice . He also takes Bugs\' place at the end of the pier and his fishing rod. Yet he is not safe from the film script even now, as a giant bluefin tuna swallows him whole. After a long struggle, Daffy frees himself and shouts “MAKE-UP!” again. Another scene wherein Bugs is chased by Elmer follows this one, culminating when Bugs dives into another tree. With the "scwewy wabbit" cornered, Elmer aims his gun into the tree but gets poked in the rear by the gun\'s barrel . When Elmer pulls his gun back, the other one makes the same movements. Wondering just how stupid Elmer is, Daffy furiously marches onto the set, snatches Elmer\'s gun and shoves him off. Daffy sticks the gun into the hole in the tree in which Bugs is hiding &mdash; but what he believes to be another gun  sticks up through a hole in the ground just behind him! Daffy retracts his gun; the “other” gun does the same. Daffy does this two or three more times before he decides to try a small experiment. He ties a red ribbon around the barrel of his gun, then sticks it into the tree, and looks behind him. The ribbon on the gun in the ground is white with red polka dots, leading Daffy to believe it to be a fake. He shoots, intending to mark Bugs, but the bent-around gun plan is revealed when the bullet hits him in the hindquarters and he pulls the gun out of the tree. The ribbon is white with red spots! Daffy didn\'t see Bugs switch the ribbon. Daffy yells “MAKE-UP!” The next scene has Bugs piloting a plane accelerating up to 20,000 feet, then going uncontrollably in the direction of the ground. Just as Daffy, dressed in his rabbit suit, jokes about not looking at Bugs\' demise, the director screams “CUT!” and the plane halts, seemingly a few feet from crashing into the ground. The director calls for "the double" one more time. Daffy  is helicoptered onto the scene, where he and Bugs switch places. After the director yells “Rrrroll \'em,” the plane resumes its super-high-speed course into the ground. Predictably, it\'s wrecked, and Daffy again yells “MAKE-UP!” for the fourth time. Having finally had more than enough, Daffy announces that “I\'m through playin\' stooge to a rabbit. I wanted to star in my own picture!” to the casting director, who promptly tells the distraught coal-coloured waterfowl that he has just such a script: the starring role in a new movie called The Duck. The final scene shows the filming of The Duck, with Daffy starring as a typical duck in a peaceful pond and directed by the same man who helmed the earlier movie wherein Daffy subbed for Bugs. Just as in the first scene of the earlier film, Daffy digs out his script to rehearse his line. When the director announces "Rrrroll \'em," Daffy says, "I wonder where all the hunters are today?”, at which point ten hunters suddenly surround the pond, gun Daffy down and leave. Again infuriated, Daffy shrieks: “I DEMAND TO KNOW WHO WROTE THIS SCRIPT!” The cruel screenwriter turns out to be none other than... Bugs, to whom the camera is now transferred and who says: “I\'d love to tell him, but... hehehehe... modesty forbids.” Iris out.'] ['“The Bike” is a film about growing up, the ability to give, the ability to make responsible actions, even when you are 11 years.

The shot begins to focus on a single train No. 2, an American 4-4-0, which is Casey\'s, which is "slow asleep", and eventually cuts to a closeup of the cab window, where Casey is revealed to be sleeping in his engine cab. Doffing his bedclothes , he checks his watch and realizing that he is behind schedule, hurriedly readies the engine to depart. Mail is loaded aboard the train and with a toot on the whistle, Casey sets off at a dangerously high speed through the maze of switches and sidings, nearly t-boning two other trains in the process before making it safely out of the yard . At first, the trip is uneventful and we see Casey relaxing in a rocking chair in front of the open firedoor, casually stoking it one piece of coal at a time as if it were a parlour stove. Further on, however, the weather turns nasty, flooding the tracks like "the bed of a creek" and all but swamping the train. Eight hours late, but nonetheless undaunted, Casey climbs up on the cab roof and uses his coal shovel as a paddle. Before long, he has cleared the flood and is on his way again. No sooner is the train back up to full speed, though, then Casey is forced to bring it screeching to a halt: standing in the middle of the tracks grazing, is a large brown cow which finally moves aside after much shouting and whistle blowing on Casey\'s part. Unfortunately, a new problem presents itself. A stereotypical villain with a black handlebar mustache has tied a lady to the tracks in front of Casey\'s train. Unwilling to waste any more time stopping, Casey rushes forward and stands on the engine\'s cowcatcher, scooping the terrified woman up just seconds in the moment in which the train is about to run her over. The villain turns to the camera and exclaims theatrically, "Curses! Foiled again!" Casey is in such a hurry now, that he doesn\'t even stop to let her off, depositing her  in the arms of a pleasantly surprised station master as he rushes past the next platform at full speed. Hours later, night has fallen and we find Casey\'s engine steaming full-bore through a narrow, snow-covered mountain pass. As the train passes over a high trestle spanning a gorge however, another stereotypical villain who is "not on the level" nearly brings things to an explosive end. Once again undaunted by a seemingly impassable obstacle, Casey\'s engine struggles, huffing and puffing, up the side of the gorge and continues on its way. A short while later, the camera focuses on a backside shot of a group of armed men on horseback as they watch the train from up on a hillside. Casey is about to get his train attacked by train robbers! The next shot finds the whole gang inside the cab, brandishing their guns and knives menacingly. At first, Casey is so caught up in stoking the boiler, that he is oblivious to their presence. It is only after he inadvertently picks up one of the robbers along with a shovel-full of coal that he finally notices the uninvited company. Even then, Casey is more annoyed by the distraction than anything else and begins to fight the robbers, hitting them repeatedly with his coal shovel while continuing to stoke the boiler. After quickly throwing the last of the would-be thieves off the train, Casey checks his watch and is horrified to discover that the robbers have put him behind schedule once again. Determined to make up for lost time whatever the cost, he opens the throttle so wide that he actually rips the handle from its mount and throws it away. The scenery outside quickly becomes a blur as the train travels faster and faster. He adds more coal to the furnace, and, when running out, he also uses his shovel and rocking chair, until the ribbing on the engine\'s boiler exterior is forced off. Casey gives the engine some running repairs while the train roars down a hill. Just a bit away a double headed slow freight train, double-headed by a pair of 2-8-0s is chugging towards Casey, who is too busy fixing the engine\'s dome to notice. The brake-man runs up to the engine to tell Casey about the oncoming double-headed slow freight train is coming, but fails to get the message, and jumps off the train after saying \'So long.\', but here\'s a goof. After jumping from the train, the brakeman is still seen on the engine\'s roof in the next shot. The crews of the double header who are approaching all gasp and abandon the train as well and run for cover and, just as Casey begins to notice, he finally gasps \'Egad!\' one more time before, the two trains begin to collide with a large explosion. Afterwards, we are taken to a station, presumably the one Casey is meant to terminate at, and, Casey being late, the Porter fears the worst. Then, much to his joy and surprise, Casey rolls down the hill in the remains of his engine carrying a bag of mail. A beaten up Casey then shows his watch with pride, it stating he is \'ON TIME-ALMOST\'. And the Narrator says \'Next time, take the train!\''] ["Oswald is a sailor who works on the ship of the admiral. One day when work was dismissed, he looks forward to find a date at a lighthouse.

While Hardy was eating with ease, the other guy appears to be having difficulty. Everytime Laurel scoops up peas with a spoon, they would often fall off and make a sound that's quite loud to some. Bothered by this, Hardy provided assistance. Krazy then came to their table and asks them to be quiet as possible. Thinking about having a little meal, Krazy saw a cross-eyed man  eating spaghetti. Krazy came to the man's table and decided to have a share of the food. While they eat, a waiter  carrying fruits in a bowl was passing by, and nearby attendants started grabbing anything they can get. Krazy also tries to pick a fruit but mistakenly grabs the waiter's long nose instead, much to the latter's annoyance.

A middle-aged man  sharpens his razor at his balcony door and tests the razor on his thumb. He then opens the door, and idly fingers the razor while gazing at the moon, about to be engulfed by a thin cloud, from his balcony. There is a cut to a close-up of a young woman  being held by the man as she calmly stares straight ahead. Another cut occurs to the moon being overcome by the cloud as the man slits the woman\'s eye with the razor, and the vitreous humour spills out from it. The subsequent title card reads "eight years later". A slim young man  bicycles down a calm urban street wearing what appears to be a nun\'s habit and a striped box with a strap around his neck. A cut occurs to the young woman from the first scene, who has been reading in a sparingly furnished upstairs apartment. She hears the young man approaching on his bicycle and casts aside the book she was reading . She goes to the window and sees the young man lying on the curb, his bicycle on the ground. She emerges from the building and attempts to revive the young man. Later, the young woman assembles pieces of the young man\'s clothing on a bed in the upstairs room, and concentrates upon the clothing. The young man appears near the door. The young man and the young woman stare at his hand, which has a hole in the palm from which ants emerge. A slow transition occurs focusing on the armpit hair of the young woman as she lies on the beach and a sea urchin at a sandy location. There is a cut to an androgynous young woman in the street below the apartment, poking at a severed hand with a cane while surrounded by a large crowd and a policeman. The crowd clears when the policeman places the hand in the box previously carried by the young man and gives it to the young woman. The androgynous young woman contemplates something happily while standing in the middle of the now busy street clutching the box. She is then run over by a car and a few bystanders gather around her. The young man and the young woman watch these events unfold from the apartment window. The young man seems to take sadistic pleasure in the androgynous young woman\'s danger and subsequent death, and as he gestures at the shocked young woman in the room with him, he leers at her and grasps her bosom. The young woman resists him at first, but then allows him to touch her as he imagines her nude from the front and the rear. The young woman pushes him away as he drifts off and she attempts to escape by running to the other side of the room. The young man corners her as she reaches for a racquet in self-defense, but he suddenly picks up two ropes and drags two grand pianos containing dead and rotting donkeys, stone tablets containing the Ten Commandments, and two rather bewildered priests  who are attached by ropes. As he is unable to move, the young woman escapes the room. The young man chases after her, but she traps his hand, which is infested with ants, in the door. She finds the young man in the next room, dressed in his nun\'s garb in the bed.  The subsequent title card reads "around three in the morning". The young man is roused from his rest by the sound of a door-buzzer ringing . The young woman goes to answer the door and does not return. Another young man dressed in lighter clothing  arrives in the apartment, gesturing angrily at him. The second young man forces the first one to throw away his nun\'s clothing and then makes him stand against a wall. The subsequent title card reads "Sixteen years ago." We see the second young man from the front for the first time as he admires the art supplies and books on the table near the wall and forces the first young man to hold two of the books as he stares at the wall. The first young man eventually shoots the second young man when the books abruptly turn into pistols. The second young man, now in a meadow, dies while swiping at a nude figure which suddenly disappears into thin air. A group of men come and carry his corpse away. The young woman returns to the apartment and sees a death head moth. The first young man sneers at her as she retreats and wipes his mouth off his face with his hand. The young woman very nervously applies some lipstick in response. Subsequently the first young man makes the young woman\'s armpit hair attach itself to where his mouth would be on his face through gestures. The young woman looks at the first young man with disgust, and leaves the apartment sticking her tongue out at him. As she exits her apartment, the street is replaced by a coastal beach, where the young woman meets a third man with whom she walks arm in arm. He shows her the time on his watch and they walk near the rocks, where they find the remnants of the first young man\'s nun\'s clothing and the box. They seem to walk away clutching each other happily and make romantic gestures in a long tracking shot. However, the film abruptly cuts to the final shot with a title card reading "In Spring," showing the couple buried in sand up to their elbows.'] ['The only fragments remaining of the film today depict a dentist named Dr. Maxwell Payne making bloody experiments with his patients.
