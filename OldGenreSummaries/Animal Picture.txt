Her mother was killed 3 years earlier in a horse riding accident. Since then Ford has sold their horse, Twister, to a neighbor and forbidden his daughters to ride. Still, Virginia sneaks out at night to see her and we see her in the beginning of the movie delivering a foal in the middle of a terrible storm. Twister dies while giving birth and Virginia names the foal Stormy. As the horse grows up, Virginia continues to sneak out to care for Stormy and ride him at night. The real owner of the horse, Blake  tries to train Stormy to race for his son Darrow , who is also Caroline\'s boyfriend, but the horse doesn\'t get along well with him. Blake decides to sell Stormy and Virginia is heartbroken because she had always considered Stormy to be her own horse, ever since she delivered him. Eventually Ford is able to track down the person who bought Stormy and he buys him back to give to Virginia as a birthday present. Meanwhile Virginia has started working with one of Blake\'s trainers named Jessie . Virginia tells her how much she loves horses and how riding them is a way for her to remember her mom. So she tries to get Ford to understand that by not letting Virginia ride he is only crushing her spirit. He reluctantly changes his mind and eventually starts riding with Virginia and giving her lessons. He mentions that there is going to be a big race on Memorial Day and tells her he thinks she\'s ready. One day, Virginia is out riding by herself and she comes across Darrow riding with his buddies. He challenges her to a race to the train tracks and Virginia barely makes it, missing the train by a few feet. That\'s when Darrow realizes that she is a better rider than he is and that he needs to do something if he\'s to prevent her from beating him in the big race. So, the night before the race, he and his buddies kidnap Stormy and hide him in an abandoned shack by a creek. When Virginia finds out that Stormy is missing she is distraught. Her father believes that Stormy has just escaped but she tells her sister that she believes Darrow stole him. Caroline thinks that she can find out what really happened by coming on to one of Darrow\'s friends. He spills the beans to her and she tells Virginia where to find Stormy. Without hesitating, she runs out the house to get him, even going as far as "borrowing" her father\'s old truck to get there in time. She finds Stormy and gets to the town square where the race is about to begin. At first they tell her that she can\'t race because she\'s a few minutes late but after the whole town starts chanting, "Let Virginia Ride! Let Virginia Ride!" she is allowed to participate. She starts out a little behind but quickly catches up to the crowd. Darrow had been in the lead since the beginning but when he sees Virginia on his tail he resorts to cheating. At one point he knocks her off her horse and then he hides one of the trail marker flags so she\'ll get lost. When she can\'t figure out which way to go by looking at her map, Stormy knows she is lost and he tries to tell her which way to go. He turns out to be right and she easily catches up to Darrow again. It\'s neck and neck along the final stretch and, although she was the last one to start, she comes in first place. Darrow\'s father Blake convinces the MC  to disqualify Virginia for some vague and unspecified violation and Darrow tries to accept the trophy. Virginia notices something in his pocket and tells Caroline to check it out. She sneaks up to him and pulls out in front of everybody the flag he had hid. He is summarily disqualified for cheating and Virginia accepts the trophy to a cheering crowd while two men from the audience toss the MC into a water trough. At home Virginia and her family are seen having dinner with Jessie, Blake\'s former trainer. We find out that he has just fired her and Caroline has just broken up with Darrow. However, Virginia comments that they are happier than they have been in a long time. She walks outside to feed Stormy and thinks to herself that she could never have gotten through the race if it wasn\'t for her cherished memories of her mother.'] ['Second Lieutenant Peter Stirling  is caught behind Japanese lines in Burma during World War II.

When Ted gets to the museum he prepares reasons as to why he would be a good candidate to take over the museum for Mr. Bloomsberry who is retiring.

On that same day, he meets his new best friend, Louis Booker , who saves him from drowning. The mobster\'s apprentice, a recently released ex-con named Frankie Lombardo ([[Michael Shannon , had tried to drown Charlie intentionally by throwing a football deep into the surf, which would make it look like he wasn\'t responsible. Twenty years later, in 2002, Charlie has his own beauty salon. Yet, Sal\'s goons arrive every week and take at least 80% of the profits, barely letting Charlie keep enough money for future improvements. Louis is still Charlie\'s best friend. After they botch the job of hiding some stolen goods , Sal gives Charlie and Louis one more chance. Under the instructions of Frankie, they have to deliver a package on the next flight to Sydney, then to Coober Pedy to meet a man named Mr. Smith. Frankie also tells them that if they should run into any trouble, they should call Mr. Smith at the cell phone number, that he gives them. Unbeknown to Charlie and Louis, Sal tells his Capo that he is "cancelling their return trip". On the plane, Louis peeks into the package, only to find $50,000. Whilst driving through the Australian Outback , Charlie and Louis inadvertently run over a red kangaroo, and seemingly killing it. Louis feels interested and puts his "lucky jacket" on the kangaroo with Charlie\'s sunglasses; they think that the kangaroo looks like Jackie Leggs, one of Sal\'s goons. When they are taking the picture, the kangaroo then comes back to consciousness and hops away, with just one problem: The $50,000 was in the jacket. Charlie and Louis hop into the jeep and chase the kangaroo attempting to grab the money from the jacket on the kangaroo, but the ensuing chase ends with the duo driving through a field of termite mounds and crashing into a pile of rocks. When they reach a nearby bar called the Old Alice Inn in Alice Springs Louis calls Mr. Smith  and tells him about the situation. Mr. Smith maliciously tells Louis that they had better have his money when he comes after them or he\'ll kill them and feed them to saltwater crocodiles. Louis gets advice from a local animal sanctuary and is told by Jessie  that the best way to catch the kangaroo is to shoot it with a tranquillizer dart fired from the air. They enlist the help of an alcoholic bushplane pilot named Blue ([[Bill Hunter . Unfortunately, an unexpected jolt causes Louis to shoot Blue with the dart rather than the kangaroo, and the plane crashes. When Blue radios for help, his air traffic controller, Tansy , has been taken hostage by Mr. Smith\'s minions and, upon hearing the location of the aircraft, they destroy the radio, gag Tansy and head off in that direction. Back in New York City, Sal gets a call from Mr. Smith, saying that Charlie and Louis haven\'t arrived yet. Thus, Sal sends Frankie and his minions to Australia to look into this. When Frankie and his minions arrive in Sydney, they\'re met by a man called Mr Jimmy who drives them into the desert. Meanwhile, Charlie and Louis attempt to reclaim the money, but end up stranded in the desert. They are met with many adversities including a pack of wild dingoes, a sand storm, and then Charlie starts to hallucinate because of the heat. He first sees their jeep and starts to relax in it, but then realizes it is a mirage. They finally get rescued by Jessie, who Charlie thinks is another mirage, so he foolishly grabs her breasts. Jessie knocks him out, and he has a delusion about the kangaroo, who starts rapping in front of him. After he awakens, he asks Jessie to help them find the missing animal. She declines at first, but when Charlie offers to pay her, she graciously accepts. The next morning, they set out on camels to find the kangaroo. Quite unexpectedly, they get attacked by Mr. Smith and his henchmen. Jessie learns the truth about the money and offers to lead Smith to the kangaroo. Smith accepts the offer and Charlie and Louis are led off by Smith\'s henchmen. However, the two friends manage to outsmart their captors, and return to rescue Jessie. Charlie has a brief confrontation with Smith before Frankie arrives. Though a welcome sight at first, Frankie turns his gun on Charlie and Louis, stating that "Sal isn\'t happy" and that Charlie has "screwed up final straw big". However, luck intervenes when a fight between Frankie and Mr. Smith escalates into a full on brawl between the two men\'s henchmen and themselves. Jessie, Louis, and Charlie escape in the chaos, but Frankie and his men give pursuit. During the chase, Louis manages to get the package back from the kangaroo, but goes off a cliff in the process. Charlie manages to save Louis from falling to his death, and at first they rejoice at having gotten the money back. Frankie arrives and Charlie attempts to return the money, but Frankie reveals that Sal really sent Charlie and Lewis to Australia to pay for their own execution at the hands of Mr. Smith. All of a sudden, Mr. Jimmy  and the police arrive and arrest Frankie, Mr. Smith, and their respective minions and Charlie reclaims Louis\' lucky jacket from the kangaroo telling Louis that if he had not put the jacket on the kangaroo, they would\' ve delivered the money to Smith, and he would\'ve killed them both, Charlie also claims that the jacket is truly lucky. One year later, Charlie and Jessie are married and sell their new shampoo and they put a picture of Jack on the bottle, Frankie and his men are imprisoned for life which Sal Maggio has also failed at avoiding, and Louis is currently Charlie\'s advertising partner. As for the kangaroo , he is still hopping around the outback.'] ['{{Expand section}} The story revolves around a little animated squirrel who, with lots of charm, accidentally helps two economically distressed families overcome their obstacles.'] ['{{plot}} James and Mollie, after struggling to put their kids, Mikey  and Julie  to bed, again have sex in their bedroom.

One day though the dog gets caught by the animal rescue force and taken to a kennel, where several other dogs are kept. He is about to be put to sleep on the same day that James brings Mikey there to select a dog. Overjoyed, Mikey bumps into the same dog he saw as a puppy, takes an instant liking to him and decides to take him home. Soon James and Mikey get home with the dog which Mikey has named Rocks, only to see that Samantha is at their house and has brought over her dog, Daphne, who is highly trained and she wants James to have her as a present from her. Mollie is angry when she discovers that James has gone and gotten a dog for Mikey without discussing it with her and the two have a brief argument. As Rocks will be put to sleep if he\'s returned to the kennel and James does not want to offend Samantha by refusing Daphne, the two realize they are stuck with two dogs. James compromises that whichever dog behaves better will stay while the other will be gotten rid of somehow. Mikey and Rocks, along with Julie and Daphne, begin a small series of sibling squabbles that irritate each child and their dog. Rocks, who had been getting threats from Mollie to be back out on the streets for eating her expensive shoes and peeing all over the floor, breaks the line by accidentally destroying Daphne\'s doghouse while playing fetch with Mikey. Daphne goes into Mollie\'s room and sets Rocks up by chewing on her shoes. Later that night when Mollie is sleeping, the dogs sneak out and have a night on the town. Daphne begins to stop being so arrogant and learns to enjoy herself and have fun. She also begins to see Rocks in a new light and soon falls in love with him, and he feels the same for her.

While being shut out on the patio, Daphne later apologizes to Rocks for her actions and it is discovered that he doesn\'t understand their attempts to train him to sit, lie down, beg, or any of the other standard tricks a dog is taught. As the world\'s most over-trained dog, Daphne proceeds to teach him the simple tricks that his family has been trying to do so. Mollie realizes that Daphne misses Rocks and talks to her about how someone can grow on you and after a while you can\'t live without them. Meanwhile, James and Samantha go to her partner\'s home cabin on Christmas Eve during a strong snowstorm. He fails to discover this is an elaborate setup to get them alone and stranded. She sends her driver away keeping James from leaving. She unplugs the phone and fax machine and plants a phony fax sheet clarifying that he  would not arrive until that night or early the following morning. Realizing he would possibly freeze to death trying to get out, James silently agrees to stay, giving Samantha the satisfaction that her setup was working. Mollie begins to suspect James is having an affair with Samantha when she calls her office and discovers the two are at a cabin in northern New York and her partner was in the Bahamas with his wife and family for the weekend, but is convinced by her mother  that James loves her and would never cheat on her. She calls back and under the guise of a flower delivery service manages to get the cabin\'s address. She gathers the children and the gifts to take Christmas to James.

After Daphne straightens out the difference between \'sniff\' and \'snort\' she finds a forest ranger, and calls the squad to the car. While instructing Samantha to dance in the den under firelight, James looks up and discovers that the phone line has been pulled from the wall. He finally catches on to her ploy, dropping her promptly onto the floor. After she tells James he deserves better than a "frumpy little housewife who doesn\'t have the ability to find a decent job" Rocks appears at the door. She continues to threaten him, stating that if he walks out the door she will fire him and he won\'t find another decent job for the rest of his \'pathetic\' life. Her voice is cut off though as Rocks urinates all over her feet and the two leave. After discovering that Mollie and the kids are no longer at the car, James and Rocks are confronted by a pack of wolves. Rocks defends James and as the attack happens off screen, there are the sounds of James\' beeper and a dog\'s yelping, presumably Rocks\'. Back at the ranger station, Mikey is looking out the window and he thinks he sees Santa hiking up the path to the station. All are surprised when James comes in the door. He explains that he was attacked by wolves and Rocks came to his rescue, leading Mikey and Daphne to believe sadly that he had been killed during this attack. James brings out his beeper, which has been crushed by the attack. Rocks appears and all is well again, apparently the sound of the beeper was what drove the wolves off and neither were hurt. After seeing that Rocks is obeying every command that comes out of James\' mouth  Mollie votes that he stays, and they are one big happy family again. Daphne chooses Rocks as her mate. The ranger chimes in and states he\'s picking up a weird transmission on his radio. He turns the dial and Santa\'s voice is made out stating "Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!" much to Mikey\'s surprise.'] ['Stallion Road is a sweeping romantic melodrama set in the 1940s California pitting a veterinarian  and a romance novelist  in a bid for the affections of a beautiful rancher . Reagan and Smith assume roles that were apparently once earmarked for Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall after their 1946 hit The Big Sleep. A delightfully witty script brings the best out of the stars and Scott shines as the cynical, world weary, but extremely charming novelist. Reagan exerts his usual tough, laconic screen persona which gels nicely with that of the rugged yet endearing rancher played by Smith. The love triangle between Reagan, Smith and Scott is played out with sophistication, wit, humour and heartfelt. Adding to the strengths of the film is a wonderful set of supporting actors. Stallion Road is a melodrama that adheres to the formulas that made this type of film so popular and powerful in the golden age of Hollywood.'] ["Teenager Josh Framm's mother, Jackie, has just married her veterinarian boyfriend, Patrick Sullivan.

By this time, Phil has been fired for missing the meeting for the last chance with Petco. He then runs to the aqueduct that the conduits lead to and finds Marmaduke in the raging waters. He begs Marmaduke to let go of the branch he\'s holding onto and let the waters carry him to Phil. He reluctantly does, and is saved. Several kids get that on video and put it on YouTube. Since it generates almost 700,000 hits, Phil is rehired. Phil then talks about moving back to Kansas, but the entire family wants to stay in California.

Everyone agrees and turn on Bosco, who leaves, vowing revenge. Meanwhile, the YouTube video also wins the company the Petco deal. He and Don begin thinking of new commercials when they ask each other about if the dogs could talk to each other, or even dance.

The intent of this film is to display the resourcefulness of young people when confronted with life threatening situations. They are also aided by the mysterious white wolf of myth and legend, who shows up to guide the way throughout the movie.'] ['{{Plot}} The film starts in the tour bus of a celebrity dog Rexxx. He is about to film a secret agent skydiving movie scene, but appears depressed and refuses. After some persuasion, he is seen on a plane and then lightning hits it, knocking Rexxx out. He lands in a truck full of tomatoes and ends up as a stray on the streets, nearly being captured by a dogcatcher. He soon meets a boy named Shane Fahey , who is ditching his science class. Because Rexxx helps to capture truant Shane, the boy hates Rexx and calls him "ugly stinking mutt," and "The Mutt from Hell". As Shane is taken to the fire station by his two friends and firefighters, Rexx stays in the basement of a textile building. Shane confronts his dad, the station captain, Captain Connor Fahey , who is currently dealing with a crisis. His station, engine 55, also known as Dogpatch, is notoriously late when dispatching and responding to fires, leading to bad publicity.  As the siren blares for yet another fire, the Dogpatch crew, engine 55, arrive last at the scene due to a faulty fire engine. Dogpatch is in competition against fire station Greenpoint who is always first to dispatch and is led by Jessie Presley. Engine 55 arrives at the fire with Shane who spots Rexxx, on the roof of the burning building. Rexxx jumps from the roof onto a trampoline held by the firefighters. Dogpatch temporarily takes the dog, who they call Dewy because of his ID tag, while Capt. Fahey orders Shane to make found dog fliers. When they return to the station, Capt. Fahey\'s friend Zachary Hayden  informs him the city manager intends to shutdown the firehouse. Fahey asks Zach to buy them time. At home, Shane makes the fliers with frustration due to Dewey, who never stands still at camera, cleans Shane\'s room, and steals Shane\'s bed. The next day, while Shane is putting up the fliers, Dewy does some special stunts with Shane\'s skateboard. Amazed, Shane brings him to the firefighter\'s picnic where there is a dog stunt competition, very similar to dog agility. After watching his friend J.J.  compete flawlessly with Greenpoint\'s female dalmatian Sparky, Shane decides to try it out. The whole crew is surprised as he effortlessly maneuvers the course, beating Sparky\'s time by several seconds. Dewy is about to win until he reaches the last obstacle, a ring with flames where he stops, apparently unwilling to jump through for fear of fire . His time runs out, and Dogpatch is still proud of Dewy and Shane, despite being taunted by Greenpoint for losing. Shane half-heartedly congratulates J.J., who informs him that "the better dog lost." With less than a week left until closing, the Dogpatch crew and Shane bond with Dewy, who happens to have a special talent for rescuing people trapped in fires. Shane asks one of Dogpatch\'s firefighters why Dogpatch is closing. He tells Shane that all the houses and buildings of the dying town have either been sold or burnt. Months earlier, his uncle and Captain of Dogpatch, Marc Fahey, had gotten killed in a saw mill fire which was suspected to be arson. While the firefighters begin to pack, Zach returns and informes them that Dogpatch does not have to close because Dewy has raised the station\'s publicity. Everyone is happy. While looking through the captain\'s office, Shane takes the sawmill mystery upon himself and examines the evidence. One of the photos is of a wrist watch, which was used to start the sawmill fire. Also, he organizes his dad\'s push pin map of fires into a map on a computer. Shane\'s dad comes home and tells him about a gala being held that evening, and then looks at Shane\'s "research" of the mystery and map. He compliments him, saying he is strong, but Shane cries and talks about Uncle Marc. He feels like a bad person because when he heard a firefighter had been missing that day, he was happy to hear his uncle had died because it wasn\'t Connor. The two bond. After heroically rescuing Jessie Presley of Greenpoint, in a tunnel fire, Dewy makes his first public debut as the Dogpatch mascot. Dogpatch then makes huge news and Dewy begins to be called "Wonderdog". The mayor decides upon keeping Dogpatch open and asks Shane to appear with Dewy at the firefighter\'s gala. Shane decides to show the audience what Dewy can do. He asks the city manager to give Shane his wrist watch, which Connor hides. Shane asks Dewy to find the watch. Instead Dewy finds his past owner Trey who had desperately searched for him all that time. After Dewy is reunited with his former owner, Shane and Connor are both exceedingly disappointed. Shane disheartedly returns to the gala and gives the watch back to the city manager Corbin Sellars, but notices it is a "BOUTINE" brand; the same brand used to start the mill fire. After following the city manager into the kitchen, he hears him plotting with another firefighter to burn their next target so the land can be used to build a football stadium. Shane rushes to the station to warn his dad who turns out to be responding to a harbor fire on a garbage barge. Dewy, who hears the sirens, jumps out of the hotel he and Trey are staying at. Dewy rushes to the fire and helps to put it out. After several failed attempts to reach his dad, Shane contacts J.J. and looks at his dad\'s city map, which displays all of the zones of buildings in the city that have either been burned or sold. To his surprise, Dogpatch is the only building left. He tells her of the scheme, they realize the fire on the garbage barge at the harbor was a decoy to occupy the firemen, and the real target is Dogpatch, the fire station. Shane hears something upstairs and hangs up on J.J. He realizes the firefighter arsonist is Zach, who set all the past fires including the mill fire, and is rigging the station. As Zach is about to leave, Shane confronts him with a fire extinguisher. They fight, but are interrupted when a huge explosion occurs, sending them to the ground. At the harbor, Dewy senses something going on at the station. He dashes all the way to Dogpatch and sees Zach about to leave. He forces him into a phone booth. Dewy then spots Shane who was unconscious and wakes him up. Dogpatch arrives first on the scene and breaks through the garage door. Zach is first to be rescued. Shane, with Dewy, frantically tries to escape, but the only exit left is the kitchen. He gets to the kitchen, but the door is sealed shut. Finally, with his father\'s help, he manages to break through. His dad ushers a choking Shane out of the building, Dewy in the lead. As his dad puts an oxygen mask on him, Shane gasps Zach Hayden set all of the fires, including the one that killed his uncle. Hayden is quickly turned over to the police. Corbin Sellars\'s scam is revealed to the news and the Dogpatch crew members each receive a medal of honor. They also renovate the station and receive a dreamed-of 900&nbsp;hp. Chrysler Hemi engine for their firetruck. Trey reclaims Dewy, but changes his mind; saying after Dewy had been a real hero, he\'d never be happy acting like one. Trey hands Dewy over to Shane, and Shane and the fire station crew are happy. The movie ends with Engine 55 going to yet another fire, with Dewy tagging along.'] ['Set in early 20th century Indiana , So Dear to My Heart tells the tale of Jeremiah Kincaid  and his quest to raise his "champion" lamb, Danny .

She, along with her research partner Becky, are trying to study and save a beautiful dolphin named Roxanne. Living next door to Mary Beth is Terry, a single dad and musician, who is the ineffective owner of Zeus, as well as being pretty inept at fathering--it looks in the beginning of the movie as if Jordan is taking care of him. After giving Mary Beth a terribly unfortunate morning by chasing her cat and wrecking her outdoor garden, Zeus proceeds to stow away on one of Mary Beth\'s boat trips, which really annoys Mary Beth. However, she suddenly turns the boat to follow the dolphin, and Zeus slips off the boat and into a pod of sharks. This is when she finds out that the dog and the dolphin can do "interspecies communication" as Roxanne saves Zeus\' life and actually gives him a ride back to the boat on her back. Of course, as a scientist, she is intrigued and curious. Claude, Mary Beth\'s partner, is a cold-hearted researcher who sees the dolphins as objects, not living beings. He is most interested in making a great deal of money through research grants, and in trying to flirt with Mary Beth, although he does not care for her but only wants to co-opt her skill and talent and defeat her own attempts to re-integrate Roxanne back into the ocean environment--he wants grant money to come to his research, not hers. However, Mary Beth is going to be otherwise occupied on both the professional and romantic fronts. She is working with Roxanne and Zeus to understand their interspecies communication, in order to re-introduce Roxanne, a "research dolphin", back into the wild. She studies Roxanne\'s interaction with Zeus, and knows that both animals actually have feelings for one another, which makes her far more inclined to see them as beings with personalities. Through the conniving of their respective children, to make things even more complicated, Mary Beth and Terry end up going out, and she learns to be a little less uptight and a bit more understanding of the unexpected. However, things get tense when Claude kidnaps Roxanne, planning to kill the dolphin to frustrate Mary Beth\'s plans, and has Zeus along in the process, to the dog\'s endangerment. In the end, it\'s a race to save the dolphin and Zeus, and in the dramatic conclusion, Mary Beth and Terry find they have far more in common than pets and kids.'] ["Eleven-year-old Napoleon  lives with his grandfather .

Jesse, now a hardy and responsible teenager, has an eye for girls, and he and his parents are preparing to go on a family camping trip to the Pacific Northwest. Before they leave town, however, Dwight, Jesse's former social worker, shows up to inform them that Jesse's birth mother, who abandoned him 8 years ago, was found in New York City, but has died and that she has left behind her other son, Jesse's half-brother named Elvis. Elvis is sulky, overly talkative, and mischievous, and he is also prone to telling lies and easily gets on Jesse's nerves. He is invited on their trip to San Juan Island so that he and Jesse might get to know one another. At the environmental institute there, Jesse reunites with his old Native American friend Randolph Johnson  whom Jesse met at the aquatic park when he met Willy and quickly becomes smitten with Randolph's attractive and kindly goddaughter, Nadine , but is reluctant to romantically approach her out of concern for his friendship with Randolph. Meanwhile, resentment and disrespect from the petulant Elvis continues to be a problem for him. Mindful of both frustrations, Randolph proceeds to tell Jesse the legend of Natsilane and gives him a carved orca pendant on a necklace to remind him of the power of his special connection to Willy. Jesse cautiously begins to show his interest in Nadine, also, and as the awkward teenagers grow closer, Jesse helps Nadine befriend Willy and his orca siblings, Luna and Little Spot, in part using amateur synchronized swimming. As they continue to enjoy their camping trip, notwithstanding more angst from Elvis regarding his unhappy childhood, an oil tanker runs aground and spills oil into the ocean, trapping the three young whales in a small cove. When word gets out that the whales are trapped and Luna is dying from the oil in her lungs, the president of the oil company  arrives and announces a great plan to move the whales into captivity where they can recover from their injuries. His real plan, however, is to sell the whales to marine mammal parks and have them perform in shows. Jesse, Nadine and Elvis get the whales away from the cove by stealing the boat belonging to Glen and leading them out of the cove to safety, but then they are not able to save themselves when the tanker explodes and the crude oil in the water catches fire. Their boat hits a rock and starts to sink, while Glen, Annie, and Randolph set out to find them in Randolph's boat and radio for help. Nadine and Elvis are lifted into a rescue helicopter summoned by Randolph's distress signals, but Jesse slips out of the harness when reaching for the rescuer's hand and crashes into the water below. Nadine and Elvis scream for Jesse and beg the helicopter to go back down, but the thick black smoke billowing up from the flaming oil begins to choke the chopper's engine, forcing the pilot to fly the chopper away. Jesse surfaces as the chopper leaves, but is unable to stay above water. He goes back underwater and sees Willy swimming towards him. Jesse grabs onto Willy's dorsal fin and Willy brings Jesse back up to the surface. Although they are trapped in the middle of the flames, Willy dives deep and is able to swim underneath, taking Jesse with him. Once they surface, they come upon Randolph's boat. Glen and Annie pull Jesse aboard and they thank Willy for saving his life. Willy does not want to leave, but Jesse tells him he's okay so he can go. Willy still does not budge and Jesse looks to Randolph for help who gives him a signal. Jesse understands what it means and pets Willy one last time before giving him a signal to swim away. Willy does and is later reunited with his family again. Later, the rescue workers bring Nadine and Elvis to the boat where they are happy to see Jesse alive. Jesse and Nadine happily hug and then Jesse acknowledges Elvis, who hands him a battered, folded up picture of Jesse and their mother. Jesse is stunned, and Elvis tells him that he had ripped up the picture out of anger, but then later had taped it back together for him. Elvis starts to cry as he tells Jesse that their mother always felt bad about abandoning Jesse and that she always talked about him, something Jesse never knew. He thanks Elvis for the picture and for finally allowing him to put the past behind him, and hugs Elvis. As they are hugging, Elvis tells him that their mother did love him. When they part, Elvis asks where Willy, Little Spot, and Luna are, and Jesse tells him that they are reunited with their mother again. Elvis asks him how he knows that and Jesse grasps the orca necklace Randolph gave him and tells him that he knows. Jesse, embracing the mission of Natsilane, then starts whispering the prayer Randolph taught him two years before as the screen fades in on Willy and his family swimming and jumping in the sea."] ['The story centers on a young boy, Nino , and his family dog, Rex, who takes on a significant role in Nino’s life after the boy loses his father to cancer.

They suspect that Willy and his pod are being illegally hunted by whalers posing as commercial fishermen. Aboard just such a ship, the Botany Bay, Max, who is ten years old, takes his first trip to sea with his father, a whaler from a long line of whalers, and learns the true unlawful nature of the family business. During his first hunt, Max is thrown overboard and comes face to face with Willy. From this point on, Max is working against his own father, teaming with Jesse and Randolph to save Willy from becoming $200-per-pound sushi. Jesse introduces Max to Willy properly after learning of Max\'s experience and how Max likes whales. Jesse tries to get his and Randolph\'s head boss to take the threat to the whales seriously, but he refuses to until Jesse manages to get proof with help from Max. Jesse manages to sneak on board the Botany Bay to steal a sample of the spear guns that are used to shoot the whales, and discovers that the whalers are heading back out to go after Willy and his pod, using an audio recording of a song which Jesse plays on his harmonica as a lure for Willy, who won\'t realize that it\'s not Jesse until it\'s too late. Jesse\'s boss plans to call for help the next day, but knowing it will be too late then, Jesse, Randolph and one of their fellow researchers, Drew, steal the Noah research boat from her mooring and go after the whalers themselves. Max manages to buy them a little time by jumping into the water and forcing the whalers to pause their pursuit of the whales to perform a "man overboard" rescue for Max, which gives Jesse and his two companions enough time to catch up. Max\'s father is angry because he learns that Max isn\'t on his side and believes that Max tried to sabotage the engine , but it doesn\'t stop him. Jesse, Randolph and Drew use a flare gun and their boat\'s P.A. system to try to bluff the whalers into stopping, but when it doesn\'t work, Jesse rams the Botany Bay with the Noah just as they fire a harpoon, the jolt causing the harpoon to miss Willy and knocking Max\'s father into the water. Willy tries to kill him, biting at him, but Jesse and Max manage to convince Willy to spare him. Max\'s father then gets trapped under a net and nearly drowns as the net drags him down, and ultimately comes face to face with Willy himself. This time, Willy, instead of killing him, saves him by pushing him to the surface and holding him there long enough for Jesse and Randolph to rescue him. The Marine Patrol arrive, having been summoned on the radio by Jesse before he rammed the Botany Bay, and catch the whalers  in the act and arrest them. Being saved by Willy causes Max\'s father to realize that he was wrong about the whales, and he apologizes to Max. The father is not sure where to go from here as his whole life has been about whaling, but Max tells him he is his father and forgives him. Later, Jesse, Randolph, Drew and Max witness the birth of Willy\'s son  and Jesse decides to name him Max when given the choice. The film ends with the two whales, their calf, and the rest of the pod swimming away out to the open sea.'] ['After three years in prison, Cruella de Vil has been cured of her lust for fur coats by Dr. Pavlov, through a process that turns predators and prey into best friends and is released on parole on the proviso she will have to pay eight million pounds to all dogs\' homes in the borough of Westminster shall she ever revert back into dognapping.

Jacob reveals he studied veterinary science and has noticed a problem with Silver, the star horse in the show. August agrees to hire Jacob as a vet for the circus animals after Jacob tells August that Silver has laminitis, is in terrible pain and will soon be unable to walk, never mind perform. August instructs Jacob to "fix" Silver and keep him performing as long as possible. But Jacob cannot bear to see Silver\'s suffering and takes it upon himself to put Silver down. August is furious with Jacob\'s decision to euthanize Silver against orders. To show Jacob who is boss, he threatens to throw him from the moving train - telling him that an animal\'s suffering is nothing compared to a man\'s, and that Jacob must carry out all of August\'s future orders if he wishes to keep his job. August eventually procures Rosie the elephant as Silver\'s replacement. He is initially thrilled and invites Jacob to his car for dinner and cocktails with him and Marlena.

While George is at school, his parents go to the orphanage where they fall in love with a thoughtful, observant "mouse"  named Stuart Little  who knows almost everything about the other children, having been there for a long time. Despite the warnings of Mrs. Keeper  , who says that humans should not be adopting "mice", they decide to adopt him as their second son. Immediately after getting home, Stuart meets Snowbell  the family cat, who immediately attempts to eat him. George is surprised when his parents introduce Stuart as his new brother. He thinks it is a joke at first, but is shocked when he sees they are serious. That night, Snowbell visits Stuart and requests that he keep a low profile, so as to avoid getting seen by the other cats and damaging Snowbell\'s reputation. George is at first sullen and somewhat disappointed and treats Stuart with contempt. He eventually snaps at a family gathering when they encourage him to play "catch" with him. He also earns Snowbell\'s wrath when his friend, Monty the Mouth  visits for food. As Snowbell tries to keep him from seeing Stuart, he makes a scene trying to get a cereal box from a cupboard. When he sees him and discovers he is a member of the family, Monty cannot contain himself. Enraged, Snowbell chases him, who narrowly escapes by fleeing into the basement. Here, he learns that George keeps a playroom and the two interact and eventually, George comes to accept him as his brother. He also finds that George keeps a toy car just his size. They decide to work together to finish George\'s homemade model boat, the Wasp, for the Central Park Boat Race the following week, but Snowbell is not finished. He and Monty head to an alley that night to visit Smokey , a Mafia Don-like Russian Blue who is the leader of the alley cats.

On the day of the 92nd annual Central Park Boat Race, the Wasp is finished, and they arrive at Central Park. George discovers his nemesis, Anton, is there.

After discussion, he reluctantly leaves with his parents, taking the toy car with him as a goodbye present from George and they go to their home, a small toy castle on a golf course. Three days later, the Littles are visited by Mrs. Keeper, whom they had asked to do some background research on Stuart. She tells them that, according to the records, his parents died several years ago after a pile of canned food fell on them. The Littles realised that he had been kidnapped and call the police. A terrified Snowbell rushes to the alley and warns Smokey and the others about the Littles\' discovery. He then decides that the only way to rectify things is to kill him. They call a meeting with Reginald and demand that he and Camille hand Stuart over. But the Stouts, having grown to care for him, reveal the truth and Reginald orders him to escape before the cats find him. He does so after saying goodbye to his "fake parents". Meanwhile, the Littles decide to place "missing" posters around the city to get help in finding him. At the Central Park, he is ambushed by Smokey and a few cats and manages to evade them by driving his car into the sewer, but he loses both the car and his luggage while escaping the storm drain. Eventually, he finds his way home just as the Littles leave to hang the posters. The only one home is Snowbell, who tells him a lie about how they are enjoying life without him, and shows him the family picture with his face cut out . He leaves again. But, Snowbell sees the pain his absence has caused and realizes his selfishness. Discovering Stuart\'s location from Monty and the other cats, who intend to eat him, Snowbell heads to Central Park and finds him sitting alone in a bird\'s nest. Snowbell turns on the other cats and escapes with him, admitting his lie to him and that the Littles actually do love him, he is in fact the only one who hates him. The cats catch up with them and Snowbell attempts to convince Smokey to call off the hit on Stuart, but is refused. Instead, he orders the cats to kill them both. Stuart responds by taking off Snowbell\'s collar and using it to lure them. The cats give chase, and eventually corner Stuart hanging from a tree branch. They get together on a lower one to catch him, but Snowbell breaks it at the last minute and sends them into the water below. Smokey sneaks up behind Snowbell and is about to kill him when Stuart releases a thin branch that hits him in the face and knocks him into the water. Enraged and humiliated, he walks off, only to be chased away by dogs upon turning a corner. Monty and the other cats also climb out of the water, whimpering and embarrassed. Stuart and Snowbell walk home and he shares a warm reunion with his family, telling them that Snowbell helped him get there. The Littles bring them inside and close the windows, ready for bed.'] ['Eddie Bob, a struggling animal trainer and widower dad, is an assistant animal trainer to Sal DeMarco, an untalented, egocentric animal show host. Both men have been hired to train the animals for a film called Frizzy, The Bichon Frise: Sal as the dog handler, and Eddie is given only the responsibility of training the lizard. When Frizzy is kidnapped, Sal quickly claims that Eddie was responsible for the dog handling. Eddie is promptly fired. The director refuses to pay the ransom and decides to instead hold auditions for the new Frizzy. Meanwhile, Eddie\'s son, Billy Bob, is walking around town when he discovers a large, stray dog is following him. Billy then brings the dog home and names him Beethoven after the dog shows interest in Ludwig van Beethoven\'s 5th symphony, after initially trying to call him Wolfgang. Eddie comes home to discover that, not only is his job gone, but now his house is wrecked by an oversized dog adopted by his son. Will soon learns that the one responsible for Frizzy\'s disappearance is Sal, accompanied by his two other cronies. He admonishes them for not waiting until Frizzy had already shot some of the movie, in order to make her valuable. The next day, when auditions are held, the director has trouble finding the right dog to replace Frizzy. Eddie has arrived  to pick up his lizard, Pete. Suddenly, Beethoven bursts in and performs an impressive chase scene with Pete the Lizard, which instantly makes the director love him. Beethoven and Eddie are hired on the spot, and Sal is sacked. To celebrate, Eddie takes Billy and Beethoven out for hamburgers, but Beethoven escapes with the burgers and leads Eddie and Billy on a chase. Finally, they find where Beethoven was going: he had been caring for his three small pups in an alley, as their mother had apparently died. In Beethoven\'s 2nd, she wasn\'t heard from again. Eddie begrudgingly adopts the puppies, as well. Eddie is then charged with having Beethoven perform the requested stunts in the movie. Unfortunately, Beethoven proves to be "untrainable", and instead, often crashes through the scene and making a sloppy mess in the process. Each time, Eddie is prepared to be fired, but the director finds these scenes even more funny and orders the scenes printed for the film. Lisa, the film\'s writer, requests from Eddie to spend more time with Beethoven so that she can write more appropriately for him. As revenge for being fired, Sal orders his henchmen to kidnap Beethoven for the million-dollar ransom, planning to kill him after the ransom is paid. They kidnap him while Billy is flirting with his crush in the park. Eddie, Billy, Lisa, and the puppies then head to Sal\'s show stage, which doubles as his secret lair, and rescue Beethoven. Sal and his goons are arrested, and Eddie and Lisa begin a relationship. The film ends with Eddie, Lisa, Billy, Katie, Beethoven, the pups, and Pete the iguana, all enjoying snacks while watching the film\'s premiere. The end credits have movie title parodies. These include Dog-E, When Hairy Met Frizzy and The Lizard of Oz. During the Gag Reel, Jonathan Silverman refers to Sal DeMarco as "Ned Ryerson". This is because the actor who played Sal, Stephen Tobolowsky, portrayed the character Ned Ryerson in the Bill Murray comedy, Groundhog Day.'] ["While searching for a memorial in Central Park, an old woman  begins to tell her granddaughter  a story. In 1925, Balto is a wolf-dog hybrid, shunned by both humans and dogs in the town of Nome. He is a rugged spirit, adventurer of his social domain; a rebel soul, no one to turn to but himself. His only friends are Boris, a Russian goose, and Muk and Luk, two polar bears. Balto and Boris live on a grounded boat outside Nome, while Muk and Luk are occasional visitors. One day, a dogsled race is being held. One of the teams is led by Steele, a proud and fierce Siberian Husky. Balto and Boris are in Nome to watch the finish. While waiting for the teams to arrive, Balto sees a young girl named Rosy and her pet, a female husky dog named Jenna. He is immediately smitten by Jenna, and when Rosy loses her hat to the wind, Balto outruns the sled team and retrieves the hat to show off. However, when he brings the hat back to Rosy, Rosy's dad pulls his daughter away from Balto, believing that he may be dangerous. Balto and Boris dejectedly leave town, but not before being bullied by Steele and his companions, Nikki, Kaltag and Star. The night after the race, Rosy and several other children fall ill. As Jenna worriedly watches through the hospital window, Balto appears and takes her to the underfloor area of the hospital, where they watch the doctor give the diagnosis — Rosy has diphtheria. Because many other children in the town have caught diphtheria, the doctor has run out of antitoxin. Jenna is sad and concerned and Balto thinks that he should have not taken her down there. Steele arrives and tries to charm Jenna with some food he stole from the butcher. Jenna makes Steele burn his tail on a heater, but, as the butcher and Rosy's dad appear, Steele frames Balto for the theft of the stolen meat, resulting in him being chased away by Rosy's dad. Meanwhile, an urgent request for diphtheria antitoxin is transmitted via telegram, but sea and air routes fail and the closest rail line only goes to Nenana. It is decided that a sled team will cover the last stretch. A race is held to determine the team members. Balto enters, and single handedly wins despite the other dogs cheating and trying to ruin it for him. However, he is disqualified when Steele steps on his paw, forcing him to bare his teeth at the musher, who then classifies him as dangerous. That night, the team, led by Steele, sets out to Nenana and picks up the medicine; however, they get lost on the way back and are led by a disoriented Steele down a steep hill, knocking out the musher. The team now has no way home. The news reaches Nome. Balto decides to set out on a rescue mission, accompanied by Boris, Muk, and Luk. On the way, they are attacked by a large grizzly bear. With Jenna's unexpected help who followed their tracks they escape, but Jenna gets injured, and Balto orders Boris and the bears to take her home. Jenna gives Balto her bandanna as a good luck charm. Before leaving, Boris gives Balto some advice  to which Balto shrugs off. Balto finds the team and offers to help them get home. Steele has gone insane and is filled with so much hatred that Balto is unable to calm him and they fight. Steele slams Balto's head on a rock knocking him out. Steele thinks he killed Balto, but star sees Balto is alive and Steele can't believe his eyes. Then Steele grabs Jenna's bandanna and pulls until he falls off a cliff. With Steele gone, Balto is chosen as the new leader of the sled dog team. Miraculously, Steele is uninjured from his fall and manages to climb back up the cliff. He sets off for Nome, creating false trail markings to throw Balto off course. Balto becomes confused by the markings and inadvertently leads the team to another cliff. The crate of antitoxin tumbles from the sled and nearly off the cliff. Balto catches it, but the ground gives way underneath him, dropping both dog and crate into the abyss. Meanwhile, Steele returns to Nome, telling Jenna and the other dogs that he survived an accident that killed Balto and the rest of the sled dog team. Steele tries to validate his story by giving Jenna her bandanna back and tells her that Balto made him promise to take care of her. Jenna does not believe Steele and leaves. Later, Jenna creates a beacon using glass shards and a lantern to shine a light pattern, a trick Balto showed her earlier. Balto wakes up at the bottom of the cliff, believing that he has failed. A large white wolf appears to him and he turns away in shame. However, as the wolf walks away, Balto notices the intact crate nearby. He realises that Boris' advice meant that being part wolf is a strength, not a weakness, and embraces that heritage with a howl, joined by the white wolf. Afterward, Balto manages to drag the crate back up the cliff to the waiting team. They are quickly on their way again, Balto using his sense of smell to figure out which trail marks are his and which are Steele's. After overcoming three near-catastrophes, Balto makes it back to Nome in time to save the children, guided by Jenna's aurora beacon. Steele is revealed to be a liar and is deserted by the other dogs in anger. Boris, Muk, Luk, and Jenna  are overjoyed, and the whole town which once shunned Balto gives him a hero's welcome. Balto and Jenna finally express their love for each other. Back in the present, the old woman and the girl read the statue's plaque lauding the courage and fidelity of the sled dogs that prevented the tragedy in Nome. After the woman explains that the trek is now honored with the annual Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race that uses the same route the dog team relay took, the girl runs off playing sled dog with her own dog.

This change is in direct opposition to Tezuka\'s stated premise behind his original Jungle Emperor story: that an inter-species society of animals must include humans as well.{{cite web}}'] ['Theodore "Ted" Brooks  is a dentist from Miami, Florida whose picture appears on every city bus in advertisements to promote his dental practice at the beginning of the film.

Hubble, who is really named Canid 3942, has been sent by the powerful Greater Dane  on a mission from the Dog Star Sirius 7 to make sure dogs have fulfilled this destiny. The dogs Owen walks include pampered Poodle Barbara Ann , cool Boxer Wilson , nervous Italian Greyhound Nelly  and gassy Bernese Mountain Dog Shep . Despite the best efforts of Owen and this rag-tag group of neighborhood dogs to convince Hubble that everything is fine with Earth\'s dogs, Hubble soon discovers the awful truth about Earth dogs: "You\'re all pets!" Things get worse when Hubble learns that the Greater Dane is headed for Earth to do her own inspection. If things don\'t look right, all dogs on Earth will be recalled to Sirius 7. Now Owen and Hubble must work together to prepare the neighborhood dogs for a visit from The Greater Dane and her Chinese Crested henchman . Owen, Hubble, Connie, and their canine companions set out to whip the other dogs into shape so that they can pass muster. Over the course of the attempts, Owen and Hubble develop a close friendship and Hubble slowly starts to act more like an Earth dog, defending Owen against bullies and trying to learn how to play fetch. Ultimately the Greater Dane shows up and is disgusted by what she sees and recalls all dogs home despite Owen\'s pleas which anger her more as humans aren\'t supposed to be able to communicate with dogs. The dogs are allowed to say goodbye and Hubble admits he really does like Owen, but doesn\'t know how to express that very well as he doesn\'t know Earth customs. Hearing Hubble tell him is enough for Owen as he\'s the only person whose dog can actually tell them that. When Hubble leaves, he leaves his rock necklace  for Owen to remember him by. After the dogs leave, all of the owners are depressed and Owen\'s family prepares to move. Owen repairs Hubble\'s communicator and sends out a message to Hubble about how much he cares for him and the Greater Dane gets it. The message intrigues her and she asks Hubble about why dogs on Earth are like this. Hubble believes that it\'s the love between humans and dogs and the partnership that creates a great loyalty between the dogs and their humans. When asked about his own loyalty, Hubble tells the Greater Dane to call him Hubble rather than Canid 3942, showing that his loyalty is to Owen. The Greater Dane allows the Earth dogs to return to Earth and declares them a separate breed. Hubble is allowed to return as well and reunites with Owen, but has to remove Owen\'s ability to understand the dogs as the condition to his return. The dogs all reunite with their owners and Hubble becomes Owen\'s dog permanently and Owen\'s parents decide not to move again and to stay. The movie ends with the dogs playing with Owen and Connie again and Hubble has now finally mastered the game of fetch. Hubble is also a lot more affectionate to Owen after his return.'] ['A family is given a puppy for a year to undergo domestic training to became a help dog for the disabled.

The tale begins: Harry as a boy ([[Daniel Clark  is in his pre-teens. His mother  dies, and he is sent to a boarding school because his father cannot look after him. Eventually his father, Tyrone Banks  comes, and takes him on a bear-hunting trip to Canada, to kill a grizzly bear. When in Canada, British Columbia to be exact, Tyrone and Harry meet up with an experienced Native American tracker with Scottish roots called Joshua McTavish Standing Bear ([[Tom Jackson . The three then go to a saloon to find some good hunters to help them on the hunt. The men in the saloon laugh at the plan for it, but some come along, bringing dogs and guns, including Grits , Genet  and Lanky . On the hunt, the boy sees two grizzly cubs which no one else sees, then escapes from the mother bear , rejoining his father. The next day, the hunters capture the two cubs, and hold them in the camp, near a waterfall called grizzly falls, hence the movie's name. The bear mother is angry, and comes to the camp. Although she cannot free her offspring, she instead kidnaps Harry to exact revenge on Tyrone. She then runs away with him, and looks after him, feeding him, and once saving his life from wolves. He is at first intent on escaping from the bear, whom he names Mizzy, but eventually grows to love her. Meanwhile Tyrone is intent on rescuing him, and Joshua comes along, but the men from the saloon and their dogs are hardly as keen. One breaks his leg at grizzly falls, and he and his friends leave, taking the bear cubs with them and setting up their own camp somewhere else. Tyrone and Joshua continue searching. In another area Harry stumbles upon the saloon men's new camp whilst Mizzy is finding food. He looks inside the hut where the men are sleeping, and wakes them up. One man tries to protect the boy but another points his gun at him. Just as this man is going to shoot, Mizzy bursts through the window, knocking down one wall of the hut. This crushes one man. Harry runs, and hides in the river nearby. One man chases after him, but cannot find him, and gets lost in the woods. Then Tyrone and Joshua find the camp, and attack the men who are in it, while the bear runs to its chained-up cubs outside, trying to free them. Tyrone and Joshua manage to shoot all the men, save for one who sneaks out and tries to shoot Mizzy, but fortunately Harry returns, knocks over the evil man,Genet and frees Mizzy's cubs. The evil man gets up, but has no time to do anything because Tyrone rushes out of the house, leaps on him, and throttles him.

Harry says goodbye to his bear-mother Mizzy, and she goes away into the mountains, reunited with her cubs. They say farewell also to Joshua, and return to Britain, where Tyrone becomes a better father, having learned a lesson on the adventure."] ['Shortly after the events of the previous film, Farmer Arthur Hoggett and Babe are famous. Esme Hoggett, his wife, embraces their fame but Arthur wants to tend to the farm. While Arthur is fixing the water pump in the well the next morning, Babe tries to help but he steps on the pump, countering the balance and Arthur goes up, jamming his fingers in the winch, the pump falls off and Arthur comes crashing back down into the water where he lets go of the rope and the pump\'s stand crushes him. After his accident, Esme tries to take over the farm but two men come from the bank one day, telling them how the farm hasn\'t paid the rent and are a week behind. Esme rushes to Arthur, remembering a letter about sheep-herding. If they do it, they will get a generous appearance fee and they will be able to keep the farm. They leave on a plane that very day. A confused sniffer dog at the airport in the city starts barking to get rewarded and they strip search Esme and X-Ray Babe. They miss their next flight and are stranded, unable to go forward or back. A man gives her the address to a hotel where he says she can stay. Esme finds the hotel and finds out that the landlady there has taken in stray animals to protect them. Esme goes out to call Arthur and Babe is kidnapped by the landlady\'s uncle, Fugly Floom, an elderly clown who performs in hospitals for children. The orangutan, Thelonius, and the apes, Bob, Zootie and Easy, who are dressed in human clothes, are loyal to Fugly whom they call \'Himself\'. When a panicked Esme and Landlady talk to him, he tells Esme that Babe has escaped and she leaves to search for him but is arrested after she causes an uproar with a motorcycle gang. Babe chooses to perform for the local children\'s hospital with the apes, hoping to earn money to save the farm. Floom serves Babe for dinner and, after being pulled back by his braces, is told it is too rare. Babe crawls off the plate and runs across the room to try and talk to Thelonius but, after Floom falls over Babe and into a cannon and sets off a fire, the show ends in disaster. Floom is later taken to the hospital because he is ill. The concerned Landlady stays by his side and leaves all the animals alone in the hotel unprotected. Thelonius broods over his ill master, the three chimpanzees leave to find food. Babe follows them and mentions his sheep herding skills. Bob uses Babe as a decoy to distract two malicious dogs guarding an alleyway while continue their search. Frightened, Babe runs away, but the spike keeping the dogs chained up breaks free and the dogs give chase throughout the city. Babe loses one in a junkyard but is still pursued by the bull terrier with the spiked collar. The dog rams into Babe, gnashing his teeth at his throat. Babe tumbles from the bridge into the river, the bull terrier missed his throat and got Babe\'s collar. He leaps after him off the bridge but the spike that held him in place in the alley gets caught in the rungs of the bridge and he dangles from the bridge, hung low enough so that his head is submurged by water. Babe swims to the hotel then, after careful consideration, chooses to rescue the bull terrier from drowning. This earns him the respect of all the animals and the loyalty of the once-dangerous bull terrier. Babe allows the strays into the hotel and Zootie goes into labor and gives birth to twins. Ferdinand, who has been trying to find Babe after he left the farm, is finally able to reach him. The animals sing Farmer Hoggett\'s song "I\'d sing you a morning". Hortense , hearing the song in animal howls and shrieks, realizes that the hotel is filled with animals and calls the officials to dispose of them. They arrive as the animals are celebrating and grab them, shoving them in sacks. Bob hides Zootie as they grab him and Easy\'s tape player is stolen and thrown into a sack that makes him chase after it and get caught. Zootie is found and taken. Cats and dogs are seized and Thelonius, sitting with his goldfish bowl, is nabbed in a net. He drops his bowl and the goldfish lies on the floor, suffocating. Babe sees it and rushes in as the mice beg him to help. A man hooks a leash around his neck and hauls him away. They reach the bottom of the stairs, Babe writhing in the man\'s grip. Ferdinad, seeing what\'s happening flies into the man who is knocked into a table and frees Babe. The vase on the table soars upwards and shatters on the landing. Babe canters through it, leaving footprints as he goes. He scoops the fish up in his mouth  and flings him into the river. The fish gives a relieved sigh and thanks Babe. The man comes in and Babe attempts to jump out of the window but the man grabs the leash. Babe dangles over the pavement, swinging from the leash. Tug, the monkey who stole Esme\'s suitcase at the start of the film, jumps on the man knocking him out of the window and into the river. Babe struggles from his leash and follows Tug and Ferdinad to the truck where the animals are being put in. Flealick, the wheelchair confined puppy, seizes a woman by her trouser leg which gets caught in the door of the van. The van drives off with Flealick clinging to it. Babe tells him to let go but he doesn\'t hear him. The van careens round a corner and the trousers rip, sending Flealick flying into a dustbin. Babe gets him out and, to Ferdinad\'s horror, he, Flealick and Tug set off to find Esme Hoggett and the animals. They find the animals in an animal prison. They sneak in at night and free the animals from their cages. They are about to leave when they find Thelonius dressing. When asked he claims that he is indecent unless he is dressed. As he pulls up his braces, Ferdinad grows impatient. He is about to leave when a man locks the door that Babe opened to get out. They are trapped. While everybody frets, Babe sees a skylight leading out and has an idea. Meanwhile, Esme Hoggett tells her story before a judge, the man who told her of the hotel, and is set free because the judge has grown up on a farm and has a soft spot for pigs. The man/judge clears her name by banging his gavel and yelling "Case dismissed!", and when Esme is done, he smiles at her in the end. She returns to the hotel and finds it empty. She ventures up the stairs, walking over the shattered vase on the landing. She turns back and bends down to look at the hoof marks left by Babe. Her dress splits down the back and Esme gasps. "Pig!" she whispers and creeps up the stairs, her dress torn down the seam. She comes to the room where Babe went and finds the landlady, clutching her uncle\'s clown costume. She tels Esme that her uncle died from an illness and Hortense turned the animals in. As Esme\'s only dress is ruined, the Landlady lends her uncle\'s clown costume— barrel like blue trousers held up with trouser braces that jangle and squeak as she walks and a shirt with a large red joke bow tie — and set off across the river. Esme pounds on the door until Hortense answers then asks savagely: "Where are our animals?". The animals made a pyrimaid to climb up and reach the skylight and clambered out onto a pipe, leading across a car park to a hospital and ballroom. Esme and the landlady use a two-seater clown bike and ride to the hospital after told by Hortense where the animals are. Esme clings to the back of an ambulance and swerves round a fountain, speeding into the car park. Flealick, who got lost along the way with the others, rushes over to them, yapping. The women follow him to a door to a kitchen. A man outside, eating a burger, sees Esme and laughs at her. Esme asks if he\'s seen the animals. He mocks her by asking what kind of animals. "A pig, cats, dogs, monkeys... that sort of thing?" She grins sheepishly. There\'s a shatter of plates from inside the kitchen and they rush in to investigate . The chef leads them in and Esme pushes past him. He seizes her as scores of animals race through the kitchen, heading for the ballroom where a banquet in honour of the hospital is being held. Several other chefs and waiters in tuxedos and bow ties grab Esme and try to keep her out. She struggles against them and gasps as Babe dashes past. Esme wrestles herself free and darts after him. The chef seizes her by her elastic braces and she rushes after Babe. She stops by the two way opening doors as the braces hold her back. The chefs all grab the braces and haul her off her feet and she flies backwards, tumbling into the chefs and waiters. Esme frees herself and she and the landlady burst into the banquet shooting fire extinguishers to keep the waiters away. All the animals except Thelonious scarper for cover. When Babe is kidnapped by a chef, the Landlady tells the chef "That\'s not your pig!" but another chef, who with another one, grabs her and pulls her away, telling her "He is my pig now." and she calls Esme warning her "Esme! The chef got your pig!" Esme is running from chefs behind her screeches to a halt as there is one in front of her. She sprays him with the fire-extinguisher then runs. As more come in front she realises she\'s trapped. Seeing this, she climbs to the top of the balcony and ties the elastic braces from the costume to a streamer from the chandelier. She exclaims, "I am Esme Cordelia Hoggett", as she pulls the knot finally, "And I have come for my Arthur\'s Pig!" People stare on in horror as she adjuts the braces and grabs the trousrs. She looks down at the chef then jumps, her braces taughtening and bouncing her back up. She misses Babe and grabs the chef\'s hat instead. She regains her composure on the balcony of the mezzanine and spots the chef again. Clutching the trousers she runs around the edge. The braces lift her off her feet and she swings down, missing him once again. She starts circling the room, boncing up and down uncontrolably. She pushes a desert trolley under the chef and he drops Babe and crashes into a table. She swings dangerously near a butler in a tuxedo, bow tie and glasses who is shielding a tottering tower of champagne glasses and, screaming, she rams into him. He falls onto a table and it collapses beneath him. Bob and Zooty have climbed on top of the chandelier. Esme swings off, her shoes have fallen off and she clings to the balcony. Panting and clinging to the braces for support, she hears a strange noise and looks down. Beneath the clown trousers, an inflatable, flesh-colored suit is rapidly expanding like a balloon. The waiter gets up and sees this. He looks into his hand and sees that, as he was falling, he accidentally pulled off a tab on the suit marked "DO NOT PULL". He realises and looks up as the trousers rip, falling off. Thelonius clambers up the walls to the balcony. The braces are attached to the hoop which somehow has attached itself to the balloon. Esme tries again and again. Thelonius clambers onto he back and stretches the braces more to help her get lower to Babe. More chefs remove their jackets and tie their braces to the streamers. Esme swings down at the same time as the chefs and they nearly collide in the middle. Esme knocks the waiter who is holding Babe over and snatches Babe back. Ferdinad squawks with glee as Esme beams at Babe. Suddenly the chandelier gives a groan. The weight of the animals, the chefs and Esme is too much and the cable snaps and the chandelier plummets to the ground. Esme screams as they drop with it. The chefs braces snap and they crash to the ground. Esme riccochetes off the ground, using the balloon as a spacehopper. She rolls over, dropping Babe and she gets tangled in her braces. Thelonius tries to help her as Babe tries to find Zooty\'s second baby. He spots it as it falls from the broken chandelier cord. He alerts Thelonius who catches it in time. Zooty thank him but Thelonius thanks "the Pig." All in a happy end, the hotel is restored to its true self with the animals moving in the farm as well as Thelonius, Arthur checks one last time to check if they have clean water, he smiles as the water pours into the trough. Holding his braces he looks at Babe and, once again, says, "That\'ll do, Pig. That\'ll do.'] ['Katherine "Katy" McLaughlin  has big dreams of administering her father\'s Wyoming horse ranch one day, but her father, Rob , has other plans. He is currently grooming her older brother, Howard , to take over the ranch and sends Katy away to an exclusive private school where she constantly feels like a misfit. Being a similar, independent spirit to Katy, Rob has a hard time understanding his daughter as she continually defies his authority to follow her own path. When she comes home for the summer, Katy is met with her father\'s disapproval because she did not finish a writing assignment at school, but is happily greeted by her mother, Nell , and Howard. As much as Katy wants to run the ranch, Howard does not, and instead longs to attend college. One day while out riding, Katy finds a wild mustang, and feels an instant connection with the horse. She sets off to tame the mare, which she names "Flicka", despite Rob\'s protests that he does not want a mustang near his horses. Later on, Flicka is captured during a roundup. Rob still does not want a wild horse running amongst the saddle horses and forbids Katy from going near Flicka. Determined to prove she can run the ranch just as well as Howard, Katy defies Rob and starts training the mare at night. Flicka slowly warms to Katy and the two developed a close bond. When Rob finds out, he sells Flicka to the rodeo, leaving Katy devastated. Both Nell and Howard are furious at Rob about making the decision without including them. Seeing his sister heartbroken over losing her beloved horse, Howard finally stands up to his father and says that he does not want the ranch. The family becomes even more divided when Rob refuses to return Flicka. Howard and Nell refuse to help Rob with the ranch, which he is now considering selling since Howard does not want it. Meanwhile, isolated in her room, Katy starts writing about Flicka to try and escape her pain. At the rodeo, Howard and Katy  enter the competition that Flicka is being used in, hoping to get the horse back. Not realizing who she is at first, the frightened mare runs from Katy until the girl calls her name. Rob, however, catches onto his daughter\'s plan and tries to intervene. Katy freezes at the sight of her father, but Howard boosts his sister onto the mare\'s back and lets the two escape. Riding Flicka, Katy becomes lost in the mountains, and allows Flicka, who knows the terrain, to make her way towards the ranch. Back at the rodeo, the family reconciles and begins searching for Katy as a fierce thunderstorm moves in. As they near the ranch, Katy and Flicka are attacked by a mountain lion. The mare bolts, throwing Katy to the ground and the cat goes to attack her. Flicka protects Katy, but is badly wounded. The girl binds the mare\'s wounds and refuses to leave her. Already cold and wet, Katy quickly develops a high fever. After hours of searching, Rob finds the two and brings a delirious Katy back to the house. As her fever spikes dangerously high, Katy calls for Flicka as Nell tends to her. Rob thinks Flicka is mortally wounded and believes she should be put down, though fellow ranchers disagree. Overhearing the argument, a dazed Katy stumbles into the room and gives her father permission to shoot the horse. Heartbroken by her words, Rob goes outside and begins to cry as he finally understands his daughter\'s feelings and her pain. Later, a gunshot is heard and Katy bursts into tears, thinking Flicka is dead. The next morning, Nell finds Rob walking back to the house, supporting the injured Flicka. She runs outside to help and finds out that the gunshot was him shooting at the mountain lion. Both are stunned that the mare is still alive and decide not to put her down. Katy\'s fever breaks and over the next couple of days, she begins to recover. As he watches over his daughter, Rob finds the story that Katy had been writing about Flicka and begins reading it, eventually typing the story and sending it to the school so that Katy can pass for the year. When Katy wakes from the fever, she and Rob reconcile and he takes her to see Flicka, whom Katy is shocked to see is alive. Rob also apologizes to Howard and gives his son his blessing. Thrilled, Howard begins preparing for college. As a family, they decide to not sell the ranch, making it both a working ranch and a refuge for wild mustangs.'] ['The film begins with a pod of orcas swimming near the coastline of the Pacific Northwest. The pod is tracked down by a large group of whalers, and a single orca ([[Keiko  gets caught in their net. Despite their best efforts to save him, his family leaves him behind, and he is taken away to a local amusement park. Sometime later in Washington, Jesse , a young 12-year-old boy who has been on the streets since he was abandoned by his mother six years before, gets caught by the police for stealing food and vandalizing a theme park, along with a group member of three other abandoned children. However, his social worker Dwight helps him avoid legal consequences by placing him in a foster home and provided he cleans up the mess at the park. While there, Jesse befriends Willy, the orca that was caught earlier and has a collapsed dorsal fin. He is amazed by Willy who obeys his commands, something the trainer, Rae Lindley , had failed to do. Over time, Jesse and Willy become the best of friends, and Jesse earns a long-term job at the marina while learning to live with his new and supportive foster parents, Glen  and Annie Greenwood . The owner of the amusement park, Dial  sees the talent Jesse and Willy have together, and makes large plans to host "The Willy Show" in hopes of boosting sales and making money for himself. On the day of the first performance, everyone is set to begin, but Willy comes down with stage fright due to the children banging constantly on his underwater observation area. Willy scares them off by smashing against the tank, unintentionally damaging it. Jesse is devastated, and plans to run away feeling everyone has let him down. Later, while at the tank, Jesse notices Willy\'s family calling to him and Dial\'s assistant Wade  and other men sneaking into the underwater observation area and damage the tank enough that the water will gradually leak out in an effort to kill Willy. It is surmised that Dial is interested in collecting the insurance money, since he has a $1,000,000 life insurance policy on Willy. Thus, Jesse, Haida native Randolph Johnson  and Rae begin plans to release the orca. They use equipment at the park to load Willy onto a trailer, and Jesse and Randolph "borrow" Glen\'s truck to tow Willy to a marina. They try to stick to back roads to keep from being spotted with a gigantic orca, and eventually get stuck. Wade meanwhile notifies Dial that the orca is missing, and begin a search to find Willy. Jesse must admit that he needs help, and calls his foster parents using a CB-Radio in Glen\'s truck. Annie and Glen show up and help free the truck, and continue on to the marina to release Willy. Dial knows where they are likely headed, and when they show up, he, Wade and his henchmen are blocking the gate into the marina. Glen charges at them full speed in the truck, forcing the henchmen to move right before the truck plows through the gate to the marina. Glen quickly turns the truck around and backs Willy into the water, flooding his truck in the process. Willy is finally released into the water, but Dial and his goons attempt to stop them. During the struggle, Jesse gets Willy to swim away, but panics when he sees that Dial has the whaling company to back him up when their boats show up in the water. They release nets and Jesse has one last chance to get Willy away before he becomes trapped. He runs towards a wall of rocks, calling for Willy to follow him, which steers him away from the boats. Jesse goes to the edge of the rocks where Willy swims up to him and tells Willy that if he makes the jump , he\'ll be free. Jesse then starts to cry as he tells Willy goodbye, but pulls himself together and goes back to the top of the rocks. He says a prayer that Randolph taught him from a story from his tribe and throws his arm in the air, giving Willy the signal to jump. To the amazement of everyone, Willy makes the jump with no problem and is finally free to return to his family and escapes the boats. Everyone cheers, Willy leaps out of the water in celebration, and Jesse happily jumps up and down, but stops when he realizes that he\'ll probably never see Willy again. He goes back to Glen and Annie who hug him as they look out into the sea. Willy calls out to Jesse in the distance and both say their final farewell. The movie ends with Willy who has found his family and the entire pod swims and jumps through the ocean.'] ["Ken McLaughlin's  mare Flicka gives birth to an all-white colt that, unknown to Ken's dad, Rob , was actually sired by a neighboring rancher's thoroughbred racehorse, Appalachia, rather than Rob's own stallion, Banner.

However, he must go to Alaska in order to collect his inheritance. He leaves Canoga Park , quits his job, despite his boss warning him that he will give up and decide to come back begging for his job back, and heads to Anchorage, Alaska. Upon arrival, Manley finds out that if he proves he is manly by participating in the yearly Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race he can obtain the land that his grandfather left to him and if he doesn\'t participate, the land wouldn\'t be signed over. While in Alaska, he meets some other participants including: the beautiful Bonnie Livengood , the stupid English Carter , ex-sheriff Ned Parker  and the local attorney Clive Thornton  who initially informed him of conditions of the race. Manley eventually discovers a box of various items that had belonged to his grandfather that included a fur cap and coat, a sword, and a diary which informed Manley that his grandfather had found gold on the land with a relative of a participant he had met earlier, Bonnie Livengood. While preparing for the event, two other participants, Clive and Carter, attempt to sabotage Manley\'s chances at winning the race so they can get the land and the gold. Clive promises to pay Carter a thousand dollars if he could prevent Kevin from entering or even finishing the race. Carter succeeds in stealing Kevin\'s team of huskies and burning down the shed containing his sled, tent, and supplies. Despite his losses, Kevin uses some of his remaining savings to buy a new sled, a tent, some winter clothing, and food supplies for him and his dogs.

The map tells them of a place known as Wolf Mountain, where Kevin believes that his grandfather hid his gold. When the storm clears, they reach Wolf Mountain and recovered the chest full of gold nuggets underneath the snow. Unfortunately, Clive and Carter arrive, take the chest of gold, and take Bonnie hostage after burying Kevin in the spot where they uncovered the gold. However, Kevin orders his lead dog, Farty to dig him out and he follows Clive and Bonnie all the way to Nome, which is the finish line of the Iditarod Sled Dog race.

After losing a late-night race with thoroughbred Trenton\'s Pride, Stripes is even more determined to be a racehorse. The other farmyard animals  disable Channing\'s motorbike so that she has to ride Stripes to her job at the racetrack, where she works as a cleaner. After dark she and stripes have their first taste of the racetrack together and are seen by old punter Woodzie who spots their potential. Champion Horse Breeder Clara Dalrymple, for whom Nolan used to train horses, nastily challenges Nolan to enter his Zebra in the Kentucky Open. Nolan can\'t afford the entry fee, but is approached by Woodzie who offers to pay. Nolan is determined not to let his daughter race, but her enthusiasm eventually wins him over, and he agrees to train Stripes. They mow a rustic-looking track in a cornfield and begin to train, helped by Tucker, a Shetland Pony who has helped coach champion racehorses in the past. Stripes loses enthusiasm after finding out he\'s a zebra, but his farmyard friends - especially Franny the goat - convince him he has a chance. Thoroughbreds Sir Trenton and his son Pride decide to teach Stripes a lesson the night before the race, and they attack him as he talks to Sandy on a riverbank. In the morning his farmyard friends rouse him and liberate Sandy, who the thoroughbreds are keeping hostage at the stables. At the races, Nolan responds to Clara\'s mockery by placing a personal bet on the race. They agree that if Stripes wins, Nolan can keep Sandy; and if her horse Pride wins, Nolan will go back to work for her. Stripes is coached through the race by Tucker, via two blowfly friends and Goose who act as messengers. In spite of losing ground half way round the course, Stripes finds the fire to catch up and win. He presents his prize wreath to Tucker, and Goose strategically poops on Clara\'s glamorous hat.'] ["A troubled fourteen-year-old girl named Alyssa  has been living with her Grandmother Lucy  since the death of her mother a year ago.

The occupant of the "flying saucer" turns out to be a cat-like alien named Zunar-J-5/9 Doric-4-7, or Jake  as he is called by his human friends (a tawny [[Abyssinian . When the Army takes his space ship into custody, without any sign of \'the pilot\', which could be a \'slimey, green-headed, twelve-legged creep\', Jake realizes that he needs help to not only get his ship back, but repair it as well, since the Mother Ship cannot send one in time. Tracking the military to the Energy Research Laboratory  Jake uses his special collar to spy on the top energy specialists in the country, hoping to find an ally. But while none of them possesses the knowledge that Jake needs, a theoretical scientist named Dr. Frank Wilson  comes along and explains that the propulsion unit from Jake\'s ship, which the military has brought to E.R.L. because they want to know what makes it tick, is tapping the Primal Mainstream. More commonly referred to as electromagnetic energy pulled in from the universe itself, Frank is rebuffed in his claims due to his odd sense of humor. Jake follows Frank to his office in the bottom floor of the E.R.L. building, where Frank nicknames him Jake. Before Jake can communicate with Frank his intentions, Dr. Liz Bartlet , who heads the Thermal Department, storms into his office, upset at Franks sense of humor in light of such an important scientific discovery. Frank is able to calm her down, mostly by introducing Jake, and asks her out to dinner. Liz accepts and leaves the small office. Once she has gone, Jake reveals his true nature to Frank, demonstrating his incredible powers of mental-communication and levitation thanks to the special collar around his neck. He eventually manages to convince Frank to help him, by offering him a quantum-leap in his own research on energy. After helping Dr. Norman Link, a garbage researcher at E.R.L., win a basketball game  and dodging Liz and her cat Lucybelle by Jake faking a cold, the pair break into Hopscotch Air Base, where Jake\'s ship is being kept, and after freezing a guard dog and a soldier to get by, make it into the hangar to commence repairs. Using a back-up collar, Frank is able to fly around the hangar and eventually up to the top of the ship where he plants a special intercog device that helps Jake find out the problem. Realizing one of the catalizers has burnt out, Jake needs an element called "Org 12" in order to be able to fly once again. However, Frank doesn\'t know what "Org 12" is, and when Jake\'s computer identifies its atomic weight as 196.967, Frank realizes that "Org 12" on Earth is actually Gold. The pair barely escape from Hopscotch base alive when a passing security guard finds the frozen soldier and dog and hits the alarm, and after Jake levitates Frank and a stolen motorcycle over the locked fence, the pair get back to Frank\'s apartment. There, Frank tells Jake that, based on Jake\'s calculations, they will need $120,000 dollars in order to buy the necessary gold to repair Jake\'s ship. Which is money that Frank doesn\'t have. The answer comes to them when Link comes over to watch horse races and football games, that he had placed major bets on. Realizing that they can use this to win the money they need, Jakes uses his powers help Link\'s horse, called Sweet Jake, win the derby. Jake and Frank use this to convince Link to help them, but have to convince Link to help them willingly. After a series of levitation tricks, Link agrees to help them. But when Jake gets knocked out by a well-meaning vet in the second football game, brought in by Dr. Bartlet because she thought Jake was still sick, the pair pull Liz along to Ernest Ernies Pool Hall, where Link has called in his bets. Desperate to get even when they find out the last football game has been lost, they are tricked into a game of pool with a hustler named Sarasota Slim. At first Frank\'s attempts to use Jake\'s collar to win go awry, nearly killing a couple of people by sending pool balls flying all over the room, Jake wakes up thanks to an onion-heavy sandwich from one of the spectators. Convincing Ernie to give them one last shot, Jake manipulates the game in order to enable Liz to win the $120,000 they need to acquire the gold for Jake\'s ship. However, all this time, a man named Stallwood, , has been watching Frank and Jake. Working as a spy at E.R.L., Stallwood first became aware of this when he say Frank and Jake break into Hopscotch. Worse, Stallwood works for a master criminal named Olympus, who is after the secret of Jake\'s collar for the purposes of universal domination. To make matters worse, the military are also on to Frank and Jake, and go to arrest them for the sake of National Security. Frank and Jake manage to elude the military and the criminals, only to have Link and Liz  captured by Olympus and his men. They plan to ransom them back for the collar, which forces Jake to make a desperate decision. Jake sends his ship back to the awaiting Mother Ship, which will not return for another 115 years, and stays on Earth in order to help rescue his friends. In the end, Jake and Frank use a broken-down biplane to rescue Liz and Lucybelle from Olympus\'s helicopter, and Jake is allowed to stay as a representative of a \'friendly power\'. He then applies for citizenship in the United States, with Frank as his sponsor, using his powers to levitate the judge who is swearing him in.'] ["Set in the country of South Africa, the story begins with a cheetah cub being orphaned after his mother was killed by lions. The cub is found on the side of the road by a young boy named Xan  and his father Peter . Initially reluctant to take in a wild animal, Peter agrees to let Xan take care of the cub. They name him “Duma”, the Swahili name for “cheetah”. Over the years, Duma becomes a part of the family, being closely raised by Xan. As he nears adulthood, Peter and Xan decide to teach Duma how to run by having him chase alongside Peter’s motorcycle, which can barely keep up with him. But with Duma almost fully grown, to Xan’s dismay, his father tells him that it is time to take his friend to his real home before he grows too old to survive in his native habitat. His father says to Xan, “Duma has to live the life he was born to – or he’ll never be fully alive.” Xan reluctantly agrees, but their plans must be put on hold when his father suddenly falls ill and dies and Xan and his mother  must move to Johannesburg. Duma comes with them, which wreaks havoc on their life in the city. Xan’s aunt is terrified of Duma, who likes to sneak up and surprise her, and when Duma escapes and pays a disastrous visit to Xan’s school, the two of them must flee the city to keep Duma from being put into captivity. Not knowing where to go, Xan gets an idea – he’ll carry out the plan his dad had outlined, taking Duma home in the neighbouring country of Botswana, over the scorching Makgadikgadi Salt Pans, through the Okavango Delta and into the Erongo Mountains. Xan begins to drive to his destination in his father’s old motorcycle, with Duma in the sidecar. After running out of fuel and water in the grasslands, they find some shade underneath a crashed airplane. There, they are confronted by Ripkuna , a mysterious drifter on a journey of his own. While Xan isn’t at all that sure he can trust Rip, he agrees to go with him. Xan manages to turn the immobile motorcycle into a desert sailboat out of a parachute from the plane wreck, and Xan, Rip and Duma are on their way again, until they encounter the untraversable scrub brush of the Kalahari Desert and must abandon the motorcycle. While trying to find shelter, Rip is trapped in an abandoned diamond mine by a cave in, and Xan decides to leave him, as he suspects that he has been leading him to town instead of the jungle to sell Duma and collect a reward for finding him. However, when Duma is caught in a trap and Xan is knocked unconscious by a boar, Rip rescues both of them, having escaped the mine through a ventilation shaft. Soon, they reach the Okavango Delta, where Xan is set upon by the deadly wildlife and the churning rapids of the Thamalakane River, but it’s too late for him to turn back now. Xan, Rip and Duma press through the Okavango, and finally the Erongo Mountains, on the border of Botswana and Namibia are in sight. However, once they get there, Xan is suddenly set upon by a swarm of tsetse flies. To protect him from their lethal bite, Rip huddles over Xan and is bitten by hundreds of flies. He soon develops sleeping sickness, and Xan takes him to a nearby village where he can be cared for. Later that night, outside the village, Duma is out on his own and starts calling out into the mountains. Duma finds another cheetah calling to him, and they bond rather quickly. It is never explained whether this is another male cheetah, or is in fact one of Duma's siblings. Xan hears this activity, and realizes that this is where he and Duma must part. Xan says goodbye to Duma, and Duma comes to Xan and says a final goodbye, and goes back to play with his new friend. Then Xan goes back to the village to Rip.

A frail and elderly artist, Jean-Michel Venture de Paradis , has been commissioned by Napoleon to sketch the landscape and monuments of Egypt. French soldier Augustin Robert  has been assigned to keep Venture from being harassed by the other soldiers, but the unrelenting burden of this task soon takes its toll on Augustin. Mameluks attack the regiment\'s small encampment. In the aftermath, Augustin and Venture are now separated from their regiment. Walking in the arid landscape, under the blaze of the desert sun, they begin to suffer an unquenchable thirst, and Augustin is infuriated when the artist uses the last of their water to mix his paints. Augustin abandons Venture, who cannot keep up, but promises to return with aid. Venture, unable to believe that Augustin will return, commits suicide. Augustin wanders aimlessly on his own. His thirst compels him to steal water from native Bedouins, frightening a young woman who startles him in her tent. Several Bedouin men give him chase in response, and he flees to some nearby caves where he is trapped until a leopard, appearing out of nowhere, slays a Bedouin who is about to kill him. Augustin is terrified at first, then astonished when the leopard gives him food and leads him to water. Augustin and the leopard, whom he names "Simoom," develop a strange and mysterious relationship, and he begins to mirror her behavior, living in the ruins of a lost city near the caves. Stripping naked, he paints his body with dirt and sand, seeking to resemble her golden-brown fur and its rosette-shaped markings. For a while they are suspicious and competitive toward each other, but a bond has nevertheless been formed. Augustin finds himself jealous when Simoom goes to mate with another leopard, but she later returns to him. The bond between Augustin and Simoom is then tested. He saves her from a group of lost French soldiers, who have wandered by and are aiming to kill her for food. Augustin, however, ultimately decides to return to his regiment rather than be branded a deserter or traitor.

He is forced to kill the leopard in self-defense. Wounded by Simoom and suffering intense heat and thirst, Augustin collapses before he is able to find his way back to civilization.

Meanwhile, an unmanned NASA space probe called the Infinity is dragged into an intergalactic wormhole, and crash-lands on an Earth-like planet on the other side of the galaxy. Zartog, an evil-minded inhabitant, accidentally discovers how to take manual control of the on-board machinery and uses it to enslave the population. Faced with the loss of the probe and probable loss of their budget, the scientists have to find a way to regain contact with the probe, to help retrieve the wayward craft. Technical genius chimp Comet gets the scientists to pick them as astronauts to explore the planet and get the probe back, with the help of the fearless Lt. Luna, and their bombastic commander, Titan. The Senator likes the idea, but wants something extra special to grab the attention of the media, and picks Ham. Ham is uninterested in the mission, but he is launched into space despite his best efforts to escape the scientist's training facility. The three chimps enter the wormhole, where Titan and Luna pass out from the pressure, leaving Ham with the task of getting the ship out and landing it. This is done, and Ham and Luna explore the planet, during which their ship, along with Titan, is taken by a group of aliens sent by Zartog. Ham and Luna begin their journey to Zartog's palace, and on the way they meet one of the inhabitants, known to them as Kilowatt. Kilowatt offers to lead them to the palace, but soon after they encounter a flesh-eating monster in a cave. The monster blocks the exit, but Kilowatt distracts it, sacrificing herself so Ham and Luna can escape. The two chimps finally reach the palace, where they discover that Titan has been teaching Zartog some of the probe's features. They rescue him and are able to board their ship, but just as they are about to leave, Ham glances outside and sees Zartog torturing some of the other aliens. He then tells Titan and Luna that they indirectly sent the probe there, and that they owe it to Kilowatt to help save the planet. The three of them exit the ship, which blasts off set to autopilot, but as they are trying to think of a plan, Zartog attacks them with the probe. Just as they are about to get destroyed, Titan tricks Zartog into triggering an ejection mechanism in the probe, which in turn leads to his defeat. The chimps then discover that Kilowatt has survived, and they are able to make contact with Comet and Houston back on Earth through a walkie-talkie. Houston reminds them that if they can redesign the probe, then they can use it to get back to Earth. They manage to do this with help from the planet's inhabitants and they use an erupting volcano to get the thrust they need to escape the planet's gravity. They go into space, and just as they are about to re-enter the wormhole, Titan hands the controls over to Ham, since Ham is the only one who can withstand the pressure, and thus, the only one who can pilot the ship home. Titan and Luna once again pass out. Ham is unsure if he is up to the task until he has a mental conversation with his grandfather, who tells him to believe in himself and to just do things his  way. Ham manages to manoeuver the ship back to Earth and land it with Luna's help, and the Senator, under pressure from the press, decides to dramatically increase the space program's funding. The film ends with a celebration being held for the chimps' return."] ["Several months after becoming Buddy's legal owner, Josh Framm , now a teenager, becomes angry when his mother, Jackie, begins dating Patrick Sullivan, the town's new veterinarian after a couple of failed dates.

Meanwhile, Selkirk Tander tries to impress Mr. Livingston's son, Bartleby Livingston by showing him a female tiger for his birthday, but Bartleby wanted an animal he can play with. He wants Air Bud  because Buddy can play sports. Mr. Livingston offers $500,000 if Selkirk can get Buddy. Selkirk then sends his nephew Grim and assistant Denning to capture Buddy. At school, Noah and Henry collect every kid's profile sheets and photos, and after looking at girls and boys who would make good owners, the family decides to call the new owners tomorrow. Grim and Denning arrive at Buddy's home, only to see Buddy and Molly at the same time, thinking there are two air buds or they are mates. The next morning, the pups decide to run away. Grim and Denning follow them, and manage to catch Budderball by luring him with a doughnut. The other Buddies go and find Budderball but they are captured as well and used as bait to catch Buddy and Molly. Buddy manages to free the Buddies but Denning traps him with a net. Molly tries to save Buddy but is captured too. The Buddies ask Sniffer for his help and where Buddy and Molly were taken to. Sniffer explains that Buddy and Molly were taken to wine country, and refuses to help because he has lost his sense of smell. In wine country, Selkirk is pleased that Denning and Grim captured both Buddy and Molly so he can have them breed puppies and sell them for money. When Grim explain that Buddy and Molly already had puppies and Denning let them get away, Selkirk tells them to lock the dogs in the wine cellar and go and capture the puppies and threatens that if they don't catch the puppies, they will be fed to the tiger. Grim and Denning go back to Buddy's home to capture the Buddies but no luck. The Buddies have sniffed their way to the outside cinema, where Grim and Denning are watching 101 Dalmatians. The Buddies find their way to the projection room and walk right in front of the projector, their shadows attracting Denning and Grim's attention. The Buddies then find a snack bar and start eating. Grim opens the projector, temporarily blinding himself. A female customer orders a box cup of popcorn, and Budderball tumbles out of the box -- her scream is heard by Denning and Grim who then slip on a wet floor. Next, the Buddies run into a motor bike gang. Still blind, Grim knocks the motor bikes over, while Denning also collides with the motorcycles, furiously calling the Buddies and the man at the movie projection booth double-crossing bottle-suckers and various other nasty names related to double-crossing. Grim and Denning knocking over the motorcycles with their clumsiness infuriates the gang, who then tie Grim and Denning in front of the cinema screen and begin throwing soda, candy, and popcorn at them. Grim and Denning catch up to the Buddies, chasing them to a farm. The Buddies meet Billy the Goat and Belinda the Pig, who help the Buddies escape from Grim and Denning. The Buddies lure Grim and Denning into a stable and escape through a small hole as Billy locks Grim and Denning in. The Buddies go through the forest then meet the Wolf who leads them to wine country. A skunk's spray enables Sniffer to smell again, so he calls Noah and Henry and they go off to find the Buddies. Buddy and Molly manage to escape to find the Buddies. Budderball falls into a hole, which Buddy and Molly dug, forcing the Buddies to help. Noah and Henry are led by Sniffer through the same farm that the Buddies went through. Noah and Henry are ecstatic and overjoyed at finding Grim and Denning being held prisoners by Billy the goat, and immediately depart to report them and turn them in to the authorities over Grim and Denning's protests. Bartleby and his father come to collect the dogs but instead finds the Buddies. Bartleby and his father then put the Buddies in a limousine, when Noah, Henry, Buddy and Molly come to rescue the Buddies. Budderball falls into one of the wine containers and gets drunk. Bartleby catches Budderball but is caught by Sniffer. Noah, Henry, and the dogs release barrels towards Selkirk and Mr. Livingston; the barrels break the wine container. Selkirk and Mr. Livingston fall in, as the container cracks open. Washing out of the container, Sheriff Bob arrives to arrest Selkirk, Denning, and Grim. The Buddies apologize to Buddy and Molly; they understand and say they're ready for their new owners. Budderball decides to stay with Bartleby because he needs a friend."] ['The story is centered on a puppy named Fluke , who has flashing memories and dreams of a human life.

John is away on animal expeditions so when the President asks for him to help with the Presidential dog and save an African forest, Maya takes his place. The dog Daisy has a very hot temper but after a lot of trouble, they begin to get along. At a dinner with the prince and princess of the kingdom that the forest is located in, things are going well until they suddenly take a turn for the worse. With the help of animals, Maya finds out Chief Dorian was sabotaging the prince to shut down the forest and make millions. He is arrested and the forest is saved.'] [" The film revolves around a special team of trained secret agent animals, equipped with advanced tools that allows the mammalian members to talk to humans. The primary field team consists of Darwin , Juarez , Blaster , star-nosed mole Speckles , and fly Mooch . The unit's leader Ben, orders an unauthorised infiltration of the residence of home electronics and appliances magnates, Leonard Saber, the owner of Saberling Technology, who has been under FBI investigation. The team is able to retrieve sensitive information about a sinister scheme that is set to occur in 29 hours. However, when Ben's superior arrives for his evaluation, his astonishment at the team's capabilities and technology is overcome by his indignation at Ben's unauthorized mission and the fact that the downloaded intelligence appears to be useless information about Saber's coffee makers. As a result, the government agent orders the unit shut down, the equipment seized and the animals to be used as experimental subjects to be killed. With the help of their human compatriots, Darwin, Juarez, Blaster, Mooch, and Speckles escape with hopes of stopping Saber's scheme, but find themselves in a pet carrying case bound for a pet shop. Trapped in the store's pet rodent display case, G-Force meets Hurley, Bucky, an irascible hamster and three sycophantic mice. Although Blaster and Juarez manage to get themselves sold to a family with plans to return to extract their comrades, Speckles' own attempt to escape by playing dead ends disastrously when he is thrown into and supposedly crushed in a garbage truck. Meanwhile, Mooch manages to return to Ben to tell him where his mammalian agents are, but Darwin escapes with Hurley before he can arrive to collect them. While Blaster and Juarez escape their new owners to return to Ben, he and his partner discover that the discredited intel has a destructive computer function that apparently hid the scheme. At this time, Darwin and Hurley make their own way to their superior. En route, Darwin sees a Saber coffee maker and decides to investigate it, but his examination of the machine makes it come alive as a dangerous fighting robot that he and Hurley are able to defeat. Later Darwin and Hurley transport the wreckage to Ben by a skateboard. However, upon arrival, Ben confesses the shattering information that they are not special genetically enhanced animals as previously told, but ordinary ones Ben took in and trained for the team . However, Hurley lifts them from their despair by reminding the team of the astounding feats he has seen them do and the fact that they obviously made themselves extraordinary on their own. Emboldened but with little time to stop the scheme, Ben provides the field team with the means to infiltrate the Saber residence and plant a virus in the computer mainframe. Unfortunately, FBI agents are ordered to capture the animals dead or alive, forcing the team to elude them with an extended pursuit thanks to a high speed vehicle especially designed for them called the Rapid Deployment Vehicle . After that is accomplished and the team infiltrates Saber's mainframe, the plan is put into motion, and the resulting battle separates the group, only leaving Darwin and Mooch to take the mainframe down. At the same time, Leonard Saber is shocked to discover that his appliances have become killing machines, expecting them to simply be able to effectively communicate with each other, while FBI takes advantage of this obvious pretext to finally openly move against the industrialist. When Darwin reaches the mainframe, he finds out that Speckles is the mastermind of the plan, whose masterstroke is to cause a massive planetwide bombardment of space junk pulled from orbit to make the planet surface uninhabitable. Speckles promptly amalgamates the various appliances in the vicinity into a giant walking robot like being, which, combined with a localised bombardment of orbital debris, soon overpowers the police forces gathered at the mansion. Darwin manages to persuade Speckles that his new family is with the rest of the team and Ben, who had taken them all in. Speckles concedes, and realising that he has gone too far, tries to shut it down, but he has lost control and the machines continue their onslaught. Darwin uses the computer virus on his PDA to take it down. The guinea pigs are personally commended by the FBI Director who also appoints them special agents of the FBI. Furthermore, G-Force is reinstated as a unit of the Bureau and expanded with Hurley, Bucky and the mice inducted as new recruits. Meanwhile, Saber makes the largest product recall in history, Speckles is given the punitive duty of personally removing the malicious chips from all Saber products, which number into the tens of millions, and Agent Killian was relocated to an FBI base in the South Pole."] ["Cheerful vagrant Stymie tries to get back in the good graces of the gang after stealing their pies.

This causes an unnamed raccoon to allow a mink to release a boulder that pushes Riggs\' car down a cliff. After that, the raccoon throws the cigar back to Riggs, who yells "you\'re a bad raccoon!". The raccoon then blows the car down the cliff. Riggs quits from Mr. Lyman\'s company, so a real estate developer from Chicago, Dan Sanders , is given the task to turn the forest into a residential development by his boss, Neal Lyman . This all transpires much to the objections of Dan\'s son, Tyler , who discovers that Rocky Springs is a forest reserve. He warns his father that "many tried to conquer it but failed". His wife, Tammy , is also unhappy in Rocky Springs, where she misses Chicago life. Unfortunately, the animals, led by the raccoon, who live in the forest do not intend to watch their forest being destroyed. They manage to turn the tables on Dan by disturbing his progress- interrupting his meetings, and humiliating him. So Dan with the help of forest rangers sets out to capture all of the forest animals. Tammy is forced to plan an "eco-friendly" fair with a senile teacher  at the high school and Lyman\'s company decides to sponsor it. The Sanders family are ignorant to the fact that Lyman and his company are actually not eco-friendly and want to cut down the forest to build houses and a shopping mall "with a forest theme". Dan releases the animals. The raccoon and his friends wreak havoc on the eco-fair, causing the guests and entertainers to flee. Lyman accidentally tranquilizes Mr. Gupta, who attempts to break their deal. He flees into a "worm tunnel" with the animals in close pursuit. They begin to attack him, as a bear drives the golf cart  away into a bush. Three months later, the forest is reclaimed as a nature preserve. Dan is a ranger, fining anyone $1 million for violating this ruling.'] ['Best friends Tod, a fox cub,  and Copper, a hound puppy,  visit a country fair when they see a band of dogs called "The Singin\' Strays".

The film ends with Copper choosing to leave the band and play with Tod again.'] ['Chance, an American Bulldog (played by [[Rattler  and narrator of the film, opens the film by explaining that he is the pet of Jamie Burnford , but expresses no interest in his owner or having a "home". He shares his home with Shadow, (played by [[Ben , an older Golden Retriever owned by Jamie\'s brother Peter Burnford , and Sassy, a Himalayan cat (played by [[Tiki , owned by their sister Hope . Bob Seaver  is marrying Laura Burnford , joining the family. Shortly after the wedding, the family goes on a trip to San Francisco, leaving the pets at a ranch belonging to Kate , a family friend. Kate later goes on a cattle drive, leaving the animals at the ranch to be looked after by one of her ranch hands. However, the animals think they have been abandoned, and Shadow begins to worry about Peter, so he decides to go find them. Sassy and a reluctant Chance follow. They head into the rocky, mountainous wilderness, with Shadow leading by instinct. After a night spent in fear of the woodland noise, the group stops to catch breakfast at a river. Two black bears steal Chance\'s fish, and when Chance barks at them in protest, they suddenly leave the fish and climb a tree. Chance cockily assumes that he has scared them off, but then a huge brown bear appears, causing the group to quickly flee, also. At another river, Sassy refuses to swim across to follow the dogs, running along the river until she reaches a path of wood that seems to cross its breadth. Halfway across, it breaks apart and she falls in. Shadow jumps in to try to save her, but she goes over a waterfall. Shadow and Chance search for her along the bank, but as night falls, they mourn their loss and continue without her. A half-drowned Sassy is rescued from the river by a man who lives in the woods, who nurses her back to health. Without Sassy, the dogs struggle to catch fish from the river. A mountain lion begins stalking them. Chance spots the mountain lion while he is fishing. He tells Shadow, but Shadow does not believe him until he sees it himself. The mountain lion follows them to the edge of a cliff. Chance, in a "just in case I don\'t make it, this is where my treasures are" statement, tells Shadow where he has buried everything at home. When Chance mentions that the remote control is buried under the seesaw, Shadow sees a balanced rock shaped like a seesaw, which gives him an idea. Shadow comes up with a plan to defeat the mountain lion. While Shadow acts as the bait, Chance waits until the mountain lion steps onto the end of the rock that\'s touching the ground, and jumps on the other end, sending the mountain lion flying over the cliff and into a river. The Mountain Lion retreats, filled with humiliation and irritation at its defeat. Sassy hears them barking in celebration and follows the sound to rejoin them. The animals continue on their way, but Chance tries to befriend a porcupine, ending up with a load of quills from its tail in his muzzle. His friends are unable to pull them out, and as they journey on, they find a little girl named Molly, who is lost in the woods. Too loyal to ignore her, they stand guard over her during the night and keep her warm. In the morning, Shadow finds a rescue party, which includes Molly\'s parents, and leads them back to her. The forest rangers with the party recognize the animals from a "missing pets" flyer they received and take them to the local animal shelter, which is dubbed by Chance as \'The Pound\'. Because Chance has had previous experiences with being in a dog pound and a subject that Shadow never believed was an actual place, he panics and warns the others to run. Sassy gets away while he and Shadow are taken inside. As the medical staff remove the quills from Chance\'s muzzle, Sassy sneaks in and frees Shadow. Together they retrieve Chance, now quill-free, and escape the shelter, without realizing that their owners were on their way to get them. The group is crossing through a train yard when Shadow falls through some old boards into a muddy pit, injuring his leg. With Sassy and Chance persuading him, he tries to climb out but is unable to climb up the slippery slope. Laying down, he says he is too old and that they should go on without him. Chance jumps into the pit to try to get him going, but Shadow refuses to move. Near dusk, the family is out in the backyard playing basketball, when Jamie claims to hear Chance barking. The others think he is imagining things, but moments later Chance comes running over a hill, happily tackling "his boy." Sassy follows to be reunited with Hope, while Peter sadly presumes Shadow was too old to make it. Moments later, Shadow limps over the hill and is reunited with Peter. As everyone watches, Chance narrates how it was Shadow\'s belief that brought them home and that Shadow was like a puppy again after being reunited with his best friend. While everyone goes inside, Chance stays behind for a moment, ending his narration by saying he had a family and for the first time in his life, he was really home and then happily runs into the house.'] ['Hardy plays Dr. Henry Tibbett, a country doctor who is called on by a travelling circus trainer to cure his sick elephant. After the doctor heals the grateful beast, the elephant becomes so attached to him that it starts to follow him everywhere. This leads to the trainer suing Dr. Tibbett for alienation of affection.'] ['The owners of Shadow the Golden Retriever , Sassy the Himalayan cat , and Chance the American Bulldog  decide to take a family trip to Canada. At the San Francisco International Airport, the animals escape after Chance panics and breaks free from his carrier. After eluding airport authorities, the animals find themselves in the city of San Francisco, with home on the other side of the Golden Gate Bridge. During the journey Chance bumps into a Boxer called Ashcan and his Bulldog friend Pete. Annoyed he refuses to let them past but Shadow tries to tell them they are just trying to get home. They don\'t listen and say they are going to eat Sassy. She hides on a window sill and Shadow and Ashcan fight. After a few seconds Sassy yells to Shadow that they have reinforcements, but it turns out to be, as Pete calls them, "Riley\'s gang". They help them and say that the city is no place for pets. Shadow explains they are lost and Riley points out that Chance is missing, He ran off as the gang arrived. Riley calls his friend Delilah, a Kuvasz, to run after him. She finds him in a light alley and explains why she was chasing him. As the other members of the gang are walking down the street they see, what they call, the "Blood red van" and hide. Shadow asks what it is for and Riley explains it takes dogs of the streets to a place called the lab. After it passes, Shadow asks Riley if he can help him and Sassy find a golden bridge, which he remembers passing on the way there. Riley explains that he can\'t because a bridge means cars and cars means humans and he doesn\'t trust humans. So they thank him for his help and head off to look for the bridge themselves. Meanwhile Delilah and Chance are walking in the park. He explains why they are in the city and when he asks her why Riley doesn\'t like humans she explains that he was abandoned as a puppy and decided to make a home for other stray dogs to protect them from all humans. Chance realizes he\'s fallen in love with Delilah and they head out of the park. Later while walking down a street Pete and Ashcan notice Shadow and Sassy walking down it too. They plan to jump at them but miss their chance. Round the corner Shadow sees a house on fire and remembers it holds that little boy named Tucker and his cat. Realizing they are still in there he runs in through the basement window and looks for them. Sassy goes in after him and looks for the kitten. Shadow comes out a few moments later with Tucker right behind him, then Sassy appears with the kitten. Tucker thanks them and they continue on. As they cross the street Riley and his gang tell them that they did a great job rescuing the boy and kitten and say they can stay with him until they find Chance. As they return to the gang\'s hideout they notice Delilah and Chance are already there. Riley tries to explain that they are different but they won\'t listen and head outside. The next day, Chance notices a tire and begins to chew on it but doesn\'t notice the "Blood red van" driving through the gates. While all the other dogs are inside Chance gets captured and driven to the lab. While there the van is stopped by the gang, Chance and the other dogs are set free, and it reverses into the river for good. Delilah then explains to Chance that Riley is right and they cannot be together. He gets upset and runs off. By now, Riley has told Shadow if humans mean that much to him he\'ll take them to the bridge. On their way home before crossing the bridge they are ambushed by Ashcan and Pete but Chance appears and fights them off. They cross the bridge and are found by their owners on a road and return home but Chance is still upset about Delilah but then he sees her appear from around the corner and they are reunited. Bob agrees she can stay, much to Chance\'s glee, and they continue with their picnic.'] ["During the Vietnam War in 1968, Captain Sam Cahill  has been working hard to create good relations between the United States and Montagnard Vietnamese in the village of Dak Nhe. The U.S. Army is looking to monitor enemy operations on a clandestine weapons supply route which passes near the village. Cahill is coming close to his discharge, and explains to his successor Captain T.C. Doyle , the delicate nature of Vietnamese customs as well as the counter intelligence involving covert enemy activity. In a lapse of judgment with surrounding village children, a child steals a Nestlé Crunch bar, the wrapper, which when found, lets the NVA know of their cooperation with the local villagers. In punishment, Brigadier Nguyen  of the NVA, at the disagreeance of his subordinate, Captain Quang , orders him to kill the villager's elephant, right before a spiritual festival. To aid the villagers, Cahill promises to replace the slain elephant before their upcoming ceremony. At their special forces camp, Major Pederson , assigns Cahill and Doyle, with Doyle in command, to secure and deliver a new elephant to the villagers, as well as two soldiers, Specialist 4 Harvey Ashford  and Specialist 5 Lawrence Farley . Cahill blackmails Chief Warrant Officer 3 Davis Poole  in to helping as well. They purchase an elephant from a Vietnamese trader in a village. They also agree to take along the elephant's handler, Linh , who has experience with verbal commands in guiding the elephant. Along the way, NVA soldiers attempt to halt their advancement with the elephant towards Dak Nhe. Following a failed air transport, the soldiers use a combination of methods to reach Pleiku Air Base before their final journey towards Dak Nhe. At Pleiku Air Base, Major Pederson notifies the captains that the mission to deliver the elephant as a favor, has been cancelled. Pederson informs the soldiers that the enemy supply route has changed direction, and they no longer need the support of the local village. Against regulations, they commandeer a cargo aircraft with the elephant on-board to deliver to the villagers as promised.

Mi loathes horses, because while a jockey in Manchester, he caused a collision which resulted in the death of another jockey. The horse is called "The Pie", short for Pirate, the epithet given him by the previous owner due to his misbehavior. Velvet wins The Pie in a raffle and convinces Mi to train them both for the Grand National. The night before the race, Velvet senses that the Latvian jockey hired to ride The Pie doesn\'t believe he can win. Rather than give up the race, Mi imagines he will overcome his fears and ride in the Latvian\'s place. Velvet has other ideas, and in the end masquerades as the jockey herself and rides the horse to victory. Exhausted by the exertion of the five-mile race, Velvet collapses from the horse shortly after the finish, and is disqualified for not staying in the saddle until reaching the enclosure. A doctor discovers the fallen jockey is, in fact, "an adolescent female", and Velvet becomes a media sensation. Velvet declines offers of 5,000 pounds to travel to Hollywood with The Pie to be filmed, as "he wouldn\'t like being looked at." In the final scene of the film, Velvet rides off to reveal to a departing Mi that his father was Mrs. Brown\'s coach in her contest-winning swim across the English Channel as a young woman. The film differs from the book in countless respects, from the colour of the horse and its name  to the appearance of Velvet and her mother, both of whom have been glamourised into very different people. Velvet, in the book, is plain, pale and sickly; her mother weighs 16 stone. The Brown family has also been made to seem more educated and richer in the film version: Mr. Brown is a prosperous butcher while Mrs. Brown, who keeps the books, has won 100 pounds for swimming the English Channel.'] ['Baxter, a bull terrier, is taken from the pens and given to an old woman.

After school that day, Ryan and his friend Johnny take the bus home to Ryan\'s house to spend the afternoon together. When Ryan checks the mail, he finds a plane ticket to China which was sent by his father. When Ryan is taken to the airport, Ryan tells his mother at the last minute that he did not want to go to China, as he thought his father cared more about his work than him. With his mother\'s kind advice of being able to come home if he did not like it in China, Ryan boards the plane to China. Meanwhile, out in the forest in China, Michael is with two companions, Ling , a young girl and translator, and Chu, Lings\' grandfather who is very experienced with pandas. Together, they track down a mother panda with a blow gun and place a radio collar on her and head back to the Panda reserve. Ryan arrives at the airport in China, with his father nowhere to be found. While wandering around in a fair, Ryan notices a bus with a panda bear logo on the side, and boards it, hoping it will take him to his father. Reluctantly, the bus treks to his father\'s location. Meanwhile back in the forest, the mother Panda steps into a bear trap as her newborn cub who is rare and priceless looks on helplessly. Back at the reserve, Michael and the staff recognize the weakness of the signal and lack of movement in the collar, which leads them to believing the panda is in danger. Just as Michael, Ling and Chu set out to visit the panda, Ryan arrives at the reserve but Michael is in a hurry, shows Ryan to his room, and forbids him to come with him into the forest. Ryan watches his dad leave, and with disgust, runs out after his father\'s tractor, scolding him for leaving him so fast. Michael claims he would be back as soon as he could and Ryan replies saying that is what he had said two years ago when he and his mother divorced and she left. This causes Michael to stop the tractor, and realizing his mistake, lets Ryan come for the mission. While they are on their way to the panda and her cub, two poachers, who had set up the trap, beat the others to them. The poacher with the gun fires at the mother panda, but the other poacher pushes the gun away, stating in Chinese that he takes the cub first and then he can shoot the mother. Meanwhile Michael, Ryan, Ling, and Chu all hear this gunshot, and Michael sets out into the forest with the blow gun. He catches the poacher ready to shoot the mother panda, shouts "NO! DON\'T SHOOT!" and sprints through the bushes toward the poacher. The poacher, terrified, blindly shoots at Michael\'s ankle, knocking him down, and runs away with the other poacher and the cub. Ryan, Ling, and Chu run over, and see Michael down and wounded in the ankle. While Chu and Michael set the mother panda loose from the trap, Ling runs back to the tractor and radios the helicopter from the reserve to bring the cub and the injured Michael back to the reserve. When the helicopter arrives, the pilot Chang states there is only room for Michael, the panda, and himself, and Ryan would have to wait at the site for Chang to come back to pick him up. While Ling and Chu set off to find the stolen cub, Ryan is waiting at the rock, muttering to himself to keep entertained. When he sees a snake in the bush, he immediately takes off through the trees, frightened, and in search of Ling. Ryan encounters Ling and Chu, and together they set out to the poachers\' home to recover the cub. The poachers, having discovered the panda was missing, catch Ryan and Ling escaping on the bridge, and shoot the bridge in order to stop them. This causes Ling to fall, just barely hanging on, leaving Ryan to try and help her up. As the poachers approach, the cub pushes both of them in, thus all 3 of them landing in the river to float downstream. Later when they tried to return the panda to the reserve, they fell into a river and down a waterfall. When they surface and get out of the water, Ryan and Ling find themselves covered with leeches so they frantically strip off their clothes and jump into the river. Ryan soon realizes that he can use the batteries in his watch to power the collar and enable his father to locate them. Attempting to make their way back to the reserve with the cub, whom Ryan decides to name Johnny, they come upon a local village that grants them hospitality for protecting Johnny. However, the poachers have also arrived and begin searching the village for Johnny. The villagers help the trio escape, but as they make their way across the mountains, the poachers follow and attempt to take Johnny. Luckily, Michael arrives and subdues the poachers. They then drive back to the reserve just as Chinese officials are about to close it. Upon seeing Ryan bring Johnny back to his mother, the officials decide let the reserve remain open.'] ["The film takes place during the 1960s space race between the United States and the Soviet Union.

After the dog is treated by a vet, Julie takes him home while trying to find its owners. A rapist breaks into her house and tries to attack her, but the dog protects her so she decides to adopt him, against her boyfriend's  wishes. Unbeknownst to her, the dog was trained by a white racist to attack any and all black people on sight. It sneaks out of the house one night and kills a black trashman in an attack. Later, when Julie takes the dog to work with her, it attacks a black actress on the set. Realizing something is not right with the dog, Julie takes him to a dog trainer, Carruthers , who tells her to kill the dog. Another dog trainer named Keys , who is black himself, undertakes re-educating the dog as a personal challenge. He dons protective gear and keeps the dog in a large enclosure, taking him out on a chain and exposing himself to the dog each day and making sure he is the only one to feed or care for the dog. The dog manages to escape, and kills an elderly black man in a church, after which Keys manages to recover him, and opts not to turn the dog in to the authorities, but to continue the training, over Julie's protests. He warns her that the training has reached a critical point, where the dog might be cured or go insane. He believes that curing the dog will discourage white racists from training dogs like this, though there is no indication in the story that this is any kind of national problem . After a lengthy time, it seems as if the dog is cured, in that he is now friendly towards Keys. Julie confronts the dog's original owner, who has come to claim him, and who presumably trained him to attack black people. She angrily tells him the dog has been cured by a black man in front of his grandchildren, who only know the dog as a loving family pet. As Julie and Keys celebrate their victory, the dog brutally attacks Carruthers, who is white, and whom the dog had not previously shown aggression towards--no explanation for this is given, but the implication is that the dog's programming has somehow been reversed, though that was never Keys' intention. To save his employer's life, Keys is forced to shoot the dog, and the film ends with the image of his body lying in the center of the training enclosure."] ["The film is told through the perspectives of Timon and Pumbaa who watch their side of The Lion King in a cinema, occasionally stopping the footage to talk with one another.

Back at the CIA, Agent Buckwhiler and Deputy Director Reynolds reveal that, in the wrong hands, the beacon can change the axis of power in the world, so they send two agents, Robert Wheeler and Vaughn Archer, down to Australia to retrieve the beacon. Department Director Ansell also secretly hires an operative of his own, Jo Buckley, to go and retrieve the beacon before Wheeler and Archer, so Ansell can take Reynolds\' job. In Australia, the crocodile that swallowed the beacon lives in a river next to the house of Brozzie Drewitt, an obnoxious cattle station owner who is taking it in her own hands to kill the crocodile for preying on her cattle. Because of this, the Department of Fauna and Fisheries send one of its workers, Sam Flynn, to Drewitt\'s house. Sam attempts to convince Brozzie to hire some professionals to relocate the animal, instead of having her kill it, which is illegal. Despite Flynn\'s words, Brozzie attempts to kill the crocodile later that night, only to fail. Meanwhile, the Crocodile Hunter Steve Irwin and his wife Terri are filming a documentary about the "less-lovable of Australia\'s wildlife" when they are hired to by Flynn to relocate the crocodile that has been bothering Brozzie. Steve successfully gets the crocodile in his boat. Wheeler and Archer are nearby using GPS technology to track the beacon. When the two agents see Steve and Terri zoom past them in their boat with the crocodile who swallowed the beacon on board, they are convinced that the Irwins have the beacon. They call up the CIA, who believe the Irwins plan to use the beacon to pay for a multi-million dollar expansion to Australia Zoo. Steve and Terri board up the crocodile in a crate and put it in the back of the truck to drive to a new river system. Wheeler and Archer follow them from behind in a Jeep, and when Wheeler hops on the top of the Irwins\' truck, Steve believes them to be poachers who are after the crocodile. Steve climbs up on the roof and, after a brief fistfight, manages to knock Wheeler off the truck. When the Irwins reach the river, Steve opens the crocodile\'s crate and discovers that the crocodile had defecated. In the poop, Steve sees a shiny metal object  which he mistakes to be a misproperly discarded children\'s spinning top toy. Steve and Terri successfully get the crocodile in the river, but Wheeler and Archer show up again in a boat, determined to get the beacon. Jo Buckley shows up in an ultralight and throws sticks of dynamite down on Wheeler and Archer\'s boat, destroying it and knocking the two agents in the river. Steve believes that he and Terri are caught up in the middle of a "poacher war" and, not wanting the dynamite to hurt the newly relocated crocodile, gets a rope out of the boat and lassoes the aircraft, causing it to crash in the river and seemingly kill Buckley. It turns out Buckley did indeed survive and she swims to shore to inform Ansell via a phone call that she failed. Ansell informs Buckley that he is currently on the run from the CIA and the police for hiring her for the mission. He is successfully found by police, ending the phone call. Due to Wheeler and Archer\'s failure to retrieve the beacon, the CIA decides that it is time for drastic measures and they call up President George W. Bush in the White House to request permission to use military helicopters to fly to Australia and get the beacon. Steve is ending his documentary by throwing the beacon in the air, when the military helicopters arrive. Steve hands them the beacon revealing that the whole predicament was a misunderstanding, and, in return, the CIA send Wheeler and Archer to work at the zoo as volunteers. Brozzie herself becomes a volunteer as well, for the Department of Fauna and Fisheries.'] ["The film begins in the home of the Newtons, where George, Alice, their three children, and Beethoven are all well adjusted to living together. Early on, Beethoven meets Missy, a female St. Bernard whose owners are attempting to settle a divorce. Regina, who is seeking $50,000 in the settlement, has retained full custody of Missy, planning to transfer her to Brillo, her future ex-husband, once the divorce is finalized. With Beethoven's help, Missy escapes from Regina's condo and the St. Bernards fall in love. Missy has four puppies who are discovered at the same time by Regina and two of the Newton children. Regina reclaims Missy and, angry about the puppies, plans to get rid of them even if it means killing them. The janitor who first found Missy and the puppies suggested that, as the puppies look to be pedigree St. Bernards, Regina might be able to sell the puppies and make a lot of money. Thinking Regina plans to drown the puppies, Ted and Emily carry them home in a box and hide them from George, who they do not think wants four puppies to deal with. Angered by the puppies' disappearance, Regina plans revenge. The three children, Ryce, Ted, and Emily, take it upon themselves to feed and care for the puppies, even getting up in the middle of the night and sneaking out of school to do so. Eventually, George and Alice discover the puppies; George, angry at first, reluctantly agrees to keep the puppies until they are mature. At this point, the puppies are presumably 8–10 weeks old, the children give them the names Chubby, Dolly, Tchaikovsky, and Moe, and George re-experiences the ordeals of dealing with growing dogs. Facing significant financial difficulty, the family is offered a free stay in a lakefront house at the mountains owned by one of George's business associates. Beethoven and the puppies, somewhat calmed down, go along on the family vacation. Ryce attends a party with friends where she is exposed to vices of teen culture such as binge drinking and getting locked in her former boyfriend's bedroom against her will. Beethoven tears the house apart, removing Ryce from potential danger. Regina and her new boyfriend, Floyd, are staying in a location unknown to Brillo, coincidentally near the Newtons' vacation residence. The Newtons go to a county fair with their dogs and the children persuade George to enter a burger eating contest with Beethoven. George and Beethoven win, much to the disappointment of the crowd. By happenstance, Regina and Floyd were at the fair and had left Missy behind in their car. Missy escapes from the car with Beethoven's help while Regina sneaks up behind the children and snatches the four puppies from them. Beethoven and Missy run into the wilderness, followed by Regina and Floyd. The Newtons follow, eventually catching up with Regina, Floyd, Beethoven, Missy, and the puppies. Floyd threatens to drop the puppies in the river below and George says the situation does not have to get ugly. Floyd pokes George in the chest with a stick, but Beethoven charges into the stick, ramming it into Floyd's crotch. He loses his balance, Regina grabs his hand, and they fall over the cliff into a pool of mud, which breaks, thus being swept away in the river. Five months later, Brillo visits the Newtons with Missy who overheard what happened at the mountains, revealing that the judge in the divorce had granted him full custody of her and awarded nothing to Regina after throwing her claim out and she and Floyd are sent to jail for their crimes. The puppies, almost full grown by then, run downstairs to see Missy as the film ends."] ['The movie starts with a dad checking on his two kids before school.

At the next obedience class, Michelangelo leaves everyone in astonishment, by finishing the entire new obstacle course, while the sergeant is announcing about the course. Meanwhile, Beethoven ruins a dinner party, when Nigel tries to kidnap him. A therapist points out to Mrs. Sedgewick that the reason "Michelangelo" is acting this way is because he is the first one exhibiting "symptoms".

Meanwhile, Mr. Newton is concerned about "Beethoven", and starts acting out to get "Beethoven" to act out again too. He drinks toilet water, chases the mailman, etc. Michelangelo ends up catching on, and turns into a perfect clone of Beethoven.

Tyler receives a baptism of fire into bush life with a trip by bush plane piloted by an odd, adventurous bush pilot named Rosie . After landing at the destination, Rosie leaves Tyler and his gear in the middle of a subzero Arctic nowhere. Unsure of where to start, Tyler\'s indecision quickly imperils him until he\'s rescued by a travelling Inuit named Ootek , who builds a shelter for him. Alone, Tyler\'s days are divided between research and mere personal survival, while nights are fraught with anxiety-born nightmares of wolf attacks upon him. He soon encounters two wolves--which he names George and Angeline, who have pups--and discovers they seem as curious of him as he is of them, slowly disspelling their mutual fears. He and the wolves both begin social exchanges, even urine-marking their territories, producing trust and respect between them. A person of procedure, Tyler soon discovers the simple, blunt arctic is indifferent to his sense of order: weather extremes, ranging from cold snow to warmer heavy rains, compromise his shelter, his paperwork duties, his research. Complicating matters further are an invasive horde of arctic mice: they\'re everywhere, frustrating him and the wolves, yet the wolves seem to cope with the madness by eating the mice, which Tyler emulates in his own bizarre way to see if an animal can survive on mice alone. Another Inuit named Mike  encounters Tyler, sent by Ootek for companionship. Mike knows English and Inuit, translating between Ootek and Tyler, with Ootek\'s responses to Tyler usually being simply translated by Mike as "He says: \'good idea\'". Ootek, the elder, is content and curious, while Mike seems not only more reserved but unhappy with the Inuit way of life, confessing to Tyler his own social apprehensions, including that of his deteriorating teeth. Tyler soon discovers that Mike is a wolf hunter, killing for pelts. Also, Tyler demonstrates a trick he\'s learned to Mike and Ootek: by playing certain notes on his bassoon, Tyler can give a fair imitation of a wolf howl, calling other wolves in. Fall nears, and Tyler hears that the caribou are migrating south, which will provide an opportunity for him to study the concept his superiors want to confirm; however, it also provides another bonding occasion between Tyler and the wolves as he helps drive caribou towards the pack, which soon takes a caribou down. Having gained the wolves\' trust, Tyler takes a bone and samples the marrow, discovering the dead caribou to be diseased; it confirms the wolves, true to Inuit lore, are not the perceived ruthless, savage killers but rather Nature\'s instrument for keeping the caribou strong. Tyler encounters Rosie nearby with two hunter-guests, making plans to commercially exploit the area\'s resources. Rosie\'s lot has improved, having moved up to a nicer Pilatus Porter turboprop bush plane on floats. Rosie insists on flying Tyler out, who defiantly refuses; Rosie then offers to extract Tyler from his research campsite in two days, the time it will take him to hike back. Tyler is alarmed at the realization that Rosie has already been to his camp. Tyler returns to the base to find things very still. He ventures into the wolves\' territory and goes into their den, only to find the pups cowering in fear. Rosie plane approaches outside. Believing that Rosie killed George and Angeline, Tyler goes out, angrily shouting at Rosie to leave. Rosie continues his approach until Tyler starts firing his shotgun at him. Rosie grimaces, then takes off. Tyler goes to his camp to find Mike resting, preparing for his final hike home. Mike\'s nervous demeanor causes Tyler to suspect the truth: it was Mike, not Rosie, who shot the wolves. Without saying it directly, Mike confirms Tyler\'s suspicions, revealing he has new dentures , saying "This thing that\'s happening is bigger than you. It\'s a question of how you survive it. Survival of the fittest." He leaves, hiking for home. Some time later, Tyler goes to a high point at the base and plays the wolf call on his bassoon, bringing in other wolves in George and Angeline\'s pack. The pups are quickly absorbed into the pack, and will live to fight another day. Tyler reflects sadly on his time here, and how he may have helped bring the modern world to this place. The narration implies that Tyler will eventually return to civilization and recover from his experiences here. Ootek has returned, and he and Tyler break camp and trek across the fall tundra enjoying each others\' company, along with the words of an Inuit song: "I think over again my small adventures, my fears. Those small ones that seemed so big. For all the vital things I had to get and to reach. And yet there is only one great thing, the only thing: To live to see the great day that dawns and the light that fills the world."'] ['{{plot}} At a satellite base in Northern Germany, a worker named Freidrich , delivering secret codes finds a Cocker Spaniel puppy outside his office.

A suspicious barn fire is followed by the theft of the horse. From the point of view of Ishak , the sheik who took him, this is property retrieval; the horse was originally his, and the Black\'s name is Shetan. Although he learns that the horse is being returned to the sheik\'s kingdom in the Moroccan desert, Alec goes after the sheik, stowing away in a plane to Casablanca. In Morocco, after being found on the plane, Alec is taken to the American embassy, where the police plan on sending him home. At the stables, he makes some friends who disguise him as a local Casablancan. They take him to a man named Kurr , who is very interested in the horse and the sheik, and allows Alec to go with him and his companion. But after getting a flat tire, they abandon Alec in the desert. He is found by the driver of another truck and given a ride. Aboard the truck, he meets Raj , who tells him the Black will probably compete in "The Great Race." The two become friends and travel across the desert on foot with Meslar , Raj\'s friend and mentor. Then a rogue tribe kidnaps Meslar, and Raj and Alec defend themselves against the harsh elements. After running out of water, they collapse from dehydration but recover when they find a river. Raj\'s tribe discovers them, welcoming Raj home and Alec to the tribe. Raj takes Alec to the outskirts of Ishak\'s home, and he reunites with the Black. While attempting to retrieve the horse, Alec is apprehended by Ishak\'s men. He pleads his case to Ishak, who is sympathetic but will not give up the horse. He plans to race the Black in the "Great Race" with his granddaughter Tabari  as jockey. Alec insists the Black can win the race only if he, not Tabari, rides him. Denied the position, he coaches Tabari on riding the horse, but the Black throws her off. A rogue tribe led by Kurr then captures the Black and Alec and takes them away. Later, Alec escapes with the Black. As they flee, Alec discovers that Meslar is alive and being held prisoner. He gives Meslar his pocket knife to help him get free of his bonds. Alec and the Black escape and go back to Ishak\'s home. As a reward for the safe return of the horse, Alec is allowed to ride him in the race. On the day of the race, Alec reunites with Raj, who is also competing, and they begin their run across the desert along with the other riders. The rogue tribe\'s rider tries to kill Alec, but he and the Black escape. Alec discovers that the rogue rider pushed Raj off his horse, and he brings Raj\'s mount back to him. They race against the rogue rider until Meslar appears and spooks the rider\'s horse, unseating him. Suddenly, Kurr shows up in his truck and chases Raj and Alec, shooting at them. However, he takes a wrong turn and the truck crashes into a ditch. Alec wins the race, then pleads with Ishak to allow Raj to keep the horse that he rode, despite the condition that the winning rider\'s sheik is allowed to keep any horses that he wants. Ishak grants the reprieve, which allows Alec to repay Raj for his kindness. Meslar returns with Kurr, his riding companion, and the rogue rider as his prisoners, and they are taken to face judgement. Although Ishak gives the Black back to Alec, he decides to leave him in Morocco, where he feels he is more at home.'] ['Young Tomás ([[John Bell  is an orphan, harassed and ridiculed by the other children in his orphanage for his timidity and stuttering.

The attackers are led by a boy who styles himself as "General Luc" and has a reputation for being bossy. The defenders are outnumbered and led by Marc, who owns a dog named Cleo. They also have the genius boy Francois on their side. Francois designs a massive snow mobile of total destruction and other shaitic. Elaborate snow fortress, and Marc\'s group constructs it. Luc arrives with his army, wearing makeshift armour and wielding wooden swords. They attempt to scale the walls with a ladder, but Luc is injured in the battle and orders a retreat. They regroup and stage a second, more covert attack, but they are spotted and beaten back again with snowballs soaked in paint. Luc counters by attacking a third time, this time with his army dressed in garbage bags as protection from the paint. They overwhelm the fort\'s defences, and Marc and Francois escape via toboggan through a secret tunnel. The two groups meet and agree to have one final battle to determine the winner. Luc shows up for the final siege with an even larger army, having recruited additional children with chocolate. They also possess new weapons such as slingshots and a snowball cannon. Luc orders them to charge, and despite being slowed by barricades, they eventually breach the fortress walls and engage in melee combat with the defenders. Marc\'s dog Cleo comes after her owner, and one of the fortress walls collapses, killing her. The war ends, as both sides help bury her. The song at the end of the movie is performed by Nathalie Simard.
