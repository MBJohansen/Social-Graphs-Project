['Set in the second half of the 22nd century, the film depicts Mars as a planet that has been 84% terraformed, allowing humans to walk on the surface without wearing pressure suits. The Martian society has become largely matriarchal, with women in most positions of authority. The story concerns a police officer, Melanie Ballard , second in command of a small team alongside Sergeant Jericho  sent to pick up and transport a prisoner named Desolation Williams . Arriving at the remote mining town where Williams is being held, Ballard finds virtually all of the people missing. She learns that the miners had discovered an underground doorway created by an ancient Martian civilization. When the door was opened it released "ghosts," disembodied spirits which possessed the miners. Violence ensues, as the possessed miners commit horrific acts of death and destruction, as well as self-mutilation. With their team leader Helena Bradock  murdered, Ballard must fight off the attacking miners, escape the town, and destroy the ghosts, if possible. Unfortunately, her intentions are complicated by the fact that killing a possessed human merely releases the Martian spirit to possess another human. The team eventually decides to blow up a nuclear reactor to try and vaporize all of the ghosts. At several points in the film Sergeant Jericho shows a romantic interest in Ballard, mostly unreciprocated. Ballard\'s crew along with survivors who manage to gather in the jail are eventually wiped out by the miners after many fierce battles and events , leaving only her and Williams after Sergeant Jericho and the other remaining officers and the two operators of the train are killed upon returning from a brief retreat to finish the fight. Not wanting the authorities to blame the massacre on him, he handcuffs Ballard to her cot and escapes from the train, leaving her to return home and deliver her report, which is received with skepticism by her superiors. While Ballard recuperates at a hospital, the released spirits, who weren\'t destroyed after all, attack the city. The end scene sets the movie up for a sequel as Williams returns to team up with Ballard to fight the possessed.'] ['Paul  is a projectionist in a Detroit theater who is reading about the 16th century disappearance of the Roanoke Colony when the lights suddenly go out in the theater. He finds that all the staff and patrons have mysteriously vanished, leaving only their clothes and non-biological parts behind. He comes across a security guard who is holding a flashlight. As Paul had a headlamp on for his reading they deduce that people holding sources of light are protected against whatever dwells in the darkness. The guard\'s flashlight goes out, and he vanishes. As Paul investigates, his head lamp goes out as well. The following morning, news reporter Luke  wakes to find that there is no power in the building. After descending from his apartment, he notices that the doorman is missing and the paper is still the previous day\'s edition. People have completely vanished from downtown streets, now littered with abandoned cars and pieces of clothing. He heads to the news station to find his girlfriend, and it is later revealed that he discovered a recording which shows his girlfriend vanishing on air when the lights go out. The only thing he is able to recover is her ring. Three days pass, and Luke is alone trying to scavenge flashlight batteries or other sources of light. He briefly encounters a man who is taken by the darkness, before coming across a bar being powered by a backup generator. The bartender\'s young son, James , allows Luke to enter, followed soon after by another survivor, Rosemary . Rosemary proves distant due to the trauma of her baby disappearing during the blackout, while James is convinced that his mother is at a church down the street and will soon return. They hear a man outside, and see Paul, who has mysteriously ended up under the lit sign of a bus stop across the road. Luke leaves the safety of the bar to recover him and Paul reveals that he had been taken by the darkness, but the headlight that he had on had activated and he had found himself in the street three days later. Due to Paul\'s massive concussion, Rosemary says that they need to find a hospital, and Luke suggests going to Chicago, where he saw a recording of a man just before the power went out at the news station three days prior. Paul tells them about the mystery of the Roanoke Colony where over a hundred settlers disappeared overnight, and they seem to be experiencing the same sort of occurrence. He tells them that the word "CROATOAN" was found carved into a tree at the site of the empty colony when the next ship arrived. With the generator running down due to extended use, they realize it is only a matter of time before the power goes out on them. Luke comes up with a plan to take one of the nearly dead trucks on the street and feed power to it with the generator. He and Rosemary leave to obtain one, nearly getting caught in the darkness when the vehicle breaks down and they lose the light. Rosemary hears a baby crying in the dark, ignoring Luke\'s warnings that it is the darkness trying to trick her, she is lured under a solitary street light, and the lamp goes out taking her with it. At the bar, James goes to get Paul some water, and the drain on the power causes the lights to flash out. Wearing a glow-stick necklace, James is safe, but Paul vanishes from the pool table on which he is lying. Luke manages to push a truck back to the bar, and he escapes with James use the generator to get the truck started. As they pass the church up the block, James gets out to find his mother. Luke leaves, but after a conflict of conscience, and seeing the word "CROATOAN" carved into a sign hanging off a bridge, he returns, using the high beams from the truck to fend off the darkness. When Luke gets out of the truck to get James, the car battery dies and Luke too disappears. As James cowers under the glow of candles, which begin to go out, he pleads with the darkness "I exist." and all but one candle goes out. James wakes to daylight and sees the last candle had been burning all night. A little girl, Briana , appears and insists that James is sleeping on her bed, but urges him to stay with her. She shows him her flashlight, which is solar powered, allowing it to stay on all night without having to search for new batteries. As they leave the church, they encounter a police horse eating spilled apples on the ground and decide to take it to Chicago. As the sun sets on the children leaving the city, the camera pans to the bar, casting the shadows of Luke, Paul and Rosemary watching the two leave as the darkness falls. As it gets dark, Briana\'s light comes on, ensuring their protection against the darkness as they begin their journey.'] ["The film revolves around the attempts of writer Thad Beaumont to kill off his pseudonym, George Stark.

Fifteen years earlier, Barker had been falsely charged and banished by the corrupt Judge Turpin , who had lusted after his wife, Lucy . At Mrs. Nellie Lovett\'s  meat pie shop on Fleet Street, he learns that Lucy poisoned herself with arsenic after Turpin raped her. Todd\'s teenage daughter Johanna  is now Turpin\'s ward and, like her mother before her, is the object of Turpin\'s lust. Todd vows revenge, reopening his barber shop in the upstairs flat after Mrs. Lovett returns his old straight razors to him. While roaming London, Anthony spots Johanna in an upstairs room of a large house singing to her birds, and a beggar woman tells him her name. Anthony is instantly smitten with her, and Turpin invites him in, only for Turpin\'s associate Beadle Bamford  to throw him out. Though Bamford warns Anthony that he will be punished if he is seen there again, the sailor becomes convinced that he and Johanna are meant to be together. During a visit to the marketplace, Todd denounces a fraudulent hair tonic by faux-Italian barber Adolfo Pirelli , and humiliates him in a public shaving contest, winning £5 and gaining the attention of Beadle Bamford. Todd becomes impatient while waiting for Beadle Bamford to arrive at his shop; Mrs. Lovett consoles him when Pirelli and his boy assistant Tobias Ragg ([[Ed Sanders  arrive. Mrs. Lovett keeps Toby occupied downstairs, while in the parlor Pirelli reveals himself to be Todd\'s former assistant, Davy Collins, and threatens to reveal Todd\'s secret to Beadle Bamford unless Todd gives him half his earnings. Instead of giving Pirelli a payoff, Todd beats him with a boiling kettle. He then stuffs Pirelli in a trunk to hide him from Toby, later slitting his throat upon realizing that he is still alive. After receiving some advice from Beadle, Turpin, intending to propose to Johanna, pays a visit to Todd\'s parlor to groom himself. Todd shaves Turpin while preparing to slit his throat; before he can do so, however, they are interrupted by Anthony, who bursts in and reveals his plan to elope with Johanna before he realizes Turpin is there. Turpin leaves enraged, vowing never to return. His chance at revenge missed, Todd swears revenge on the entire world and vents his murderous rage upon his customers while waiting for another chance to kill Turpin. He is indiscriminate about his killings, believing that he is punishing the corrupt aristocracy for their exploitation of those below them, while saving the lower classes from their misery. Mrs. Lovett becomes his willing accomplice, suggesting they dispose of the bodies by baking them into pies to improve her business. Todd rigs his barber\'s chair with a pedal-operated mechanism, which deposits his victims through a trap door into Lovett\'s bakehouse. Meanwhile, Anthony begins to search for Johanna, who was sent by Turpin to Fogg\'s insane asylum upon discovering her plans to elope with Anthony. The barbering and pie-making business prospers, and Lovett takes in Toby. With both of the shops being such a success, Mrs. Lovett informs Todd of her plans to move to the seaside. Anthony finally discovers Johanna\'s whereabouts, and under advice from Todd, he poses as a wig-maker\'s apprentice, who are allowed into asylums to collect hair for wigs, thus providing him the access he needs to rescue Johanna. Todd comes up with a new plan to lure Turpin back, and has Toby deliver a letter to him telling him where Johanna will be brought when Anthony frees her. Toby has become wary of Todd and tells Mrs. Lovett, unaware of her role in the crimes: he promises to protect her, loving her as a surrogate mother. Beadle Bamford arrives at the barber shop, informing them that neighbors complain of the stink coming out of the chimney. He is murdered by Todd, and Mrs. Lovett informs him of Toby\'s suspicions. The pair search for Toby, whom Mrs. Lovett has locked in the basement bakehouse to keep him out of the way. Toby is nowhere to be found, having hidden in the sewers after seeing the Beadle\'s body drop into the room from the trap door above, as well as finding a toe in a pie. Meanwhile, Anthony frees Johanna and brings her to the shop in disguise, while locking an asylum staff-member in a cell, where it is implied the inmates kill him. In Todd\'s shop Johanna hides herself in a trunk in a corner of the room while Anthony finds a coach. The insane beggar woman who has been pestering Todd, Lovett and Anthony throughout the film makes her way into the shop seemingly searching for the Beadle. As Todd enters, she claims that she recognizes him. Just then, Turpin\'s voice is heard. Todd quickly slits the beggar woman\'s throat and deposits her body through the trap door. As Turpin enters, Todd explains to him that Johanna had repented, and offers a free shave. Todd reveals his true identity to Turpin and stabs him in the neck numerous times before finally slitting his throat and dropping him through the trap door. As Johanna peeks out of the trunk, Todd spots her and prepares to slit her throat as well, not recognizing her as his daughter. Upon hearing a scream from Lovett, he is distracted. He tells Johanna to "forget my face", and leaves her alive in his shop. Todd runs to the basement, where he discovers that the beggar woman was his wife Lucy, whom he had believed to be dead based on Lovett\'s account of the poisoning. Todd realizes that Lovett knew Lucy was alive, and she attempts to convince him that she misled him for his own good, confessing she loves him. Todd pretends to forgive her, waltzing maniacally with her around the bakehouse before hurling her into the open furnace and locking her in. He returns to Lucy and cradles her dead body in his arms. Having witnessed the death of the only mother he has ever had, a vengeful Toby emerges from the sewer, picks up the discarded razor and slits Todd\'s throat. The film ends with Toby walking away as Todd bleeds to death over his dead wife.'] ['Maggie O\'Connor\'s  life revolves around her job as a nurse at a busy New York hospital, until one rainy night, her sister Jenna  abandons her newborn autistic daughter, Cody, at her home. Maggie takes Cody in, and she becomes the daughter she never had. Six years later, Jenna suddenly re-appears with a mysterious new husband, Eric , and abducts Cody . Despite the fact that Maggie has no legal rights to Cody, FBI agent John Travis , an expert in ritual murder and occult-related crime, takes up her case when he realizes that Cody shares the same birth date as several other recently missing children. Cody, it soon becomes clear, is more than simply "special." She manifests extraordinary powers that the forces of evil have waited centuries to control, and her abduction sparks a clash between the soldiers of good and evil that can only be resolved, in the end, by the strength of one small child and the love she inspires in those she touches.'] ['The story opens with a robed, profusely bleeding "God" disemboweling himself, with the act ultimately ending in his death. A woman, Mother Earth, emerges from his remains, arouses the body, and impregnates herself with his semen. Becoming pregnant, she wanders off into a vast and barren landscape. The pregnancy manifests in a fully grown convulsing man whom she leaves to his own devices. The "Son of Earth" meets a group of faceless nomads who seize him with what is either a very long umbilical cord or a rope. The Son of Earth vomits organic pieces, and the nomads excitedly accept these as gifts. The nomads finally bring the man to a fire and burn him. "Mother Earth" encounters the resurrected man and comforts him. She seizes the man with a similar umbilical cord. The nomads appear and proceed to rape her. Son of Earth is left to mourn over the lifeless body. A group of characters appears, carry her off and dismember her, later returning for Son of Earth. After he, too, is dismembered, the group buries the remains, planting the parts into the crust of the earth. The burial site becomes lush with flowers.'] ["The beginning starts with the Masterson family being murdered. The mother puts away a bloody knife, leaves a baby to drown in the bathtub with the water running, writes a note, and then shoots herself in the mouth with a pistol. Twenty years later, ghost hunter Carter Simms is offered $5,000 to stay a weekend in the Masterson house to investigate paranormal activity. The owner of the house also hires help for Carter, which include Colin Green as the videographer and Yvette Sandoval as a journalist. Together they set up equipment to help find and investigate any evidence of ghosts or paranormal activity. The group is then joined by Mary Young Mortensen, a young member of the Mastersons' church. She claims she was also sent by owner of the house to assist in the investigation. She also states that she is there to protect the reputations of the Mastersons because they were great members of their church. The group stays in the Masterson house for three days. Several mysterious things happen: the room temperature in the master bedroom lowers dramatically in a short period; a chair moves on its own; a gunshot and mysterious voices are recorded and some ghostly figures are recorded on video. By the beginning of day three, Colin gets a call from the owner of the house and it turns out Mary Young Mortensen was never supposed to be at the house; so Carter forces Mary to leave. Later that night, nothing much is happening, but the group reviews a video tape and sees a figure in the guest house. As they are going to investigate the guest house, we flash to a scene where Mary is on a radio talk show concerned about the people out to discredit the good name of the Mastersons. She convinces herself she needs to stop them and returns to the house. Mary then begins killing all members of the group, writes a note, and commits suicide much like the mother did in the opening scenes of the movie. It turns out Mary was the small child left by the mother in the opening scene. She was rescued before she drowned and apparently adopted by the first officer to arrive on the scene. As Mary is preparing for her suicide, she tells the sordid story of the Mastersons, involving the imprisonment, rape and torture of her mother who eventually became pregnant with her. The birth of Mary caused Mrs. Masterson to kill her family and Mary's mother. As the movie ends, it switches to a scene where Carter is seen looking at and in to a infrared camera. It turns out she is now a ghost in the house, unable to leave along with the other ghosts."] ['Centuries ago, the Aztec empire of Mexico was conquered by the Spanish conquistadors. Horrified by their religious practices, the Spaniards set out to convert the native population to Catholicism, effectively declaring war upon the Aztec religion. According to an ancient prophecy, the Aztecs and their religion will return to dominance in a time known as the Sixth Sun. While attempting to illegally cross the United States-Mexico border, young orphan boy Juan Diego is singled out by a fellow traveler, a strange old man known only as "Old Indian" claiming to know the way. The old man leads the boy to an old Aztec shrine dedicated to the god of death, Mictlantecuhtli. Explaining that they must give thanks to Tezcatlipoca, the god of sacrifice, Old Indian proceeds to carve a symbol of the god in to Diego\'s hand. Declaring the boy\'s blood to be pure, the Old Indian dies in the throes of invocations of Nahuatl, abandoning the boy in the desert. Ten years later, 21-year-old Diego has made a home for himself in East Los Angeles. He shares an apartment with his best friend Zak and is in love with Maria, niece of Padre Somera of the local mission which dates back to the Cortés era. However, Diego and Maria\'s relationship is strained both by his haunting encounter with Old Indian and the devout Padre\'s disapproval of the young man\'s sympathy towards Aztec beliefs and mythology. Anticipating a local Dia de los Muertos festival, Diego begins to feel the call of something powerful. He dresses as an undead Mariachi, clad in black with the traditional markings to give himself a skeletal appearance. En route to the celebration, the forces of the Aztec underworld cause Diego\'s car to crash, ending his life. Diego awakens in the Aztec afterlife of Mictlan where the god of death sacrifices him to Tezcatlipoca in a ritual where his heart is torn from his chest with the aid of an obsidian blade. He is then sent back to the land of the living exactly one year after his death. Diego, selected long ago by the Old Indian, is the sacrificial priest in service to Tezcatlipoca. In order to fulfill the prophecy of the Sixth Sun, Tezcatlipoca requires three human sacrifices, each symbolizing the Catholic Church that wiped out the old gods over five hundred years ago. And Maria, being the direct descendant of the Somera family is at risk. Armed with the power to take life or restore it, Diego must struggle against the very gods who created him in order to save the woman he loves.'] ['{{plot}} Dr. Joe Darrow and wife Dr. Emily Darrow work at a well known hospital in Chicago. While she specialises in pediatric oncology, he is the head of the emergency room. Occasionally, Emily takes trips to Venezuela to help the native people who are unable to afford healthcare. At nearly seven months pregnant, she was needed by the people in Venezuela. Joe disapproves of her going and insists she stay home in case she delivers the baby. In spite of how her husband feels, she heads to the Amazon area without him. The weather takes a turn for the worse where she is located and the entire village is evacuated. In the midst of evacuation, the bus in which Dr. Emily and the people were on is hit by a landslide, rolls off the road and plunges into the river below. Joe tries his best to function as normal, but he does not take time to grieve his wife\'s death. He returns to work as if nothing has happened. One night he is awakened by his wife\'s dragonfly paper weight that falls to the ground and rolls across the room. His wife always had a passion for dragonflies. She has a birthmark on her shoulder which resembles a dragonfly. Before his wife died, they had promised one another to look after the other\'s patients if something were to happen to either one of them. A few nights later, he falls asleep on the pediatric oncology floor. While there, one of his wife\'s patients is brought in by the medical staff, unconscious. The staff tries to revive him, but are having little success. He hears the child calling his name over and over, "Joe, Joe, can\'t you hear me? Joe." Naturally, he follows the staff to confirm if what he is hearing is real. All the monitors on the child show no heartbeat. Finally, the child responds to their treatment, and his heart begins beating. The following afternoon, he returns to the child and questions him. The child asks him if he is "Emily\'s Joe" and tells him she sent him back to tell Joe something. All over the room are drawings of a curvy cross. He asks the boy if he knows what it is, but the boy replies that he doesn\'t know. The boy said that he had a near death experience, and when he was clinically dead, saw all that was going on inside the hospital room. Then, the boy said, he saw a light, and there was a woman standing there. She showed him an image of Joe, and told him he had to go back. The boy then suddenly points at the picture of the wavy cross symbol he drew, saying, "This is what I saw at the end of the rainbow." Later, while passing by another child\'s room, Joe sees the same drawing and the boy immediately knows who Joe is and tells him that he must "go to the rainbow" then points to the symbol on the wall. When Joe asks the boy if he knows what it means, he too does not. Still no one understands or can explain what it means. When he arrives at home, his parrot  mysteriously goes into a rage. The parrot knocks out the light and breaks a pot. Joe spots something outside and when he goes to the window, he sees a dragonfly flying. There is no light around, yet it still flies. He also briefly sees Emily. Later, when he comes back to look at the mess in the kitchen, he sees the same wavy cross symbol drawn in the spilled soil on the floor. Days pass by, and Joe still does not know what is taking over his life. His neighbour and longtime friend, Miriam Belmont, tries to bring him back into reality, to no avail. The breaking point in his life occurs at the hospital. He is alone with a clinically dead patient , when he believes his wife speaks through the patient. Joe tries to stop the surgical procedure, and security is called in to arrest him. Miriam bails him out of jail on special conditions. He decides to sell his home and go on vacation. While packing away his wife\'s belongings, the lightbulb in the room burns out. When he returns with a new bulb, all the belongings he had packed away are suddenly back in their original places. He believes he is losing his grip on life, and in desperation he runs out the front door and pleads for help. He enters his kitchen where one of his wife\'s maps has blown open. On the map he sees the mysterious curvy cross symbol. He calls a friend who tells him the wiggly cross is the map symbol for a waterfall. He then sees a photo of his wife posing in front of a waterfall with a rainbow behind her created by the sun\'s rays hitting the mist; he then realizes what the boys meant about a rainbow. He decides he has to go there. He takes a trip to the South American village where his wife spent her last days. Somehow, he believes if he could find out where the accident took place, he might get closure. Joe\'s pilot, Victor, takes him to the makeshift cemetery and he looks at the victims\' graves. Joe asks his native guides if they know where his wife is buried, they start arguing with each other that he should be brought to the village. Joe\'s attention then shifts to the village and he runs off to it. He then comes to a cliff and sees the bus, which had never been removed from the river and remains near the scene of the accident. Joe then jumps into the river and enters the semi-flooded bus, but this seems to cause the bus to shift and it moves further downriver, flooding as it goes until it\'s completely submerged. Joe is trapped inside when one of his legs gets jammed under the seat. At first he fights to escape, but calms down when a bright glow fills the bus and his wife appears to him. She reaches her hand out and they connect. The events of her final hours flash before him. He sees that she survived the initial accident and was pulled to safety by nearby Yanomami villagers. He is then suddenly rescued out of the bus by Victor. Determined to reach the village, Joe runs to it, alarming Victor who says they need permission first. Reaching it, he\'s surrounded by angry native men holding weapons. He holds up a photo of his wife. A native woman walks up to him and begins speaking to him, saying that they couldn\'t save her body but they saved her soul. Perplexed, he follows her into one of the huts, and inside is a female infant in a basket. The child his wife was carrying had survived the accident. Immediately tears begin to flow from his eyes. The woman shows him a birthmark on the child; it is in the shape of a dragonfly on the inside of her ankle. As he embraces his daughter, he drops to his knees and begins to sob, realizing what his wife was trying to tell him. The film ends with Joe back in the United States, playing with his daughter who is now a toddler, having the same wavy blonde hair and who is the very image of his wife.'] ["Although this film is a remake of 1962's Carnival of Souls, it bears little resemblance to the original aside from the ending.

A couple\'s young son, Nic, falls from a window to his death on the snowy ground below while his parents  passionately make love. Chapter One: Grief: During Nick\'s funeral, the wife collapses. The other mourners gather around her, their faces blurred. Spending the next month in the hospital, in and out of consciousness and with little concept of time, she awakens crippled with grief. Her husband, a therapist, is skeptical of the psychiatric care she is receiving and takes it upon himself to treat her with psychotherapy. After a less-than-fruitful period at home, during which she tries to free herself from the pain of her child\'s death and dependence on psychiatric drugs, he decides to try exposure therapy. In an isolated cabin in the woods  where she spent time with Nick the previous summer while writing a thesis on Gynocide, he learns that her greatest fear centers on the structure and the surrounding vegetation. During the journey to Eden, while she sleeps, he encounters a deer which shows no fear of him. As the deer turns to leave he sees a dead fawn hanging halfway out of the womb. Chapter Two: Pain : The couple continue towards the cabin. Upon encountering a foot-bridge, she is overcome with fear. She hesitates and then sprints across the bridge and into the woods, leaving him to follow after her. During sessions of psychotherapy she becomes increasingly grief-stricken and manic. The environment surrounding the cabin also becomes increasingly sinister- acorns pelt the cabin like rapid gunfire, he awakens to find his hand covered in swollen ticks, and at the conclusion of this chapter he comes across a self-disemboweling fox which utters the words "chaos reigns." Chapter Three: Despair : He finds his wife\'s thesis studies- pictures of witch-hunts and a scrap-book filled with articles and notes on misogynist topics. Her writing becomes more frantic and illegible as the pages go on. It is revealed that, while writing her thesis, she came to believe that all women are inherently evil. He is repulsed by this and reproaches her for buying into the gynocidal beliefs she had originally set out to criticize. She asks him to hit her during sex. At first he resists, but when she flees into the woods and begins masturbating underneath a large tree he chases after her and half-heartedly complies. While they make love numerous hands are seen emerging from the roots of the tree.  He goes on to study Nick\'s autopsy report which states the bones in both of the child\'s feet were oddly deformed. The doctors at the time did not assign any importance to this fact as it was unrelated to the child\'s death. Finding numerous photographs of Nick in which his boots are on the wrong feet, he becomes increasingly agitated. This bizarre revelation has sinister undertones regarding his wife, who had been alone with the boy at the time the pictures were taken. At this moment she attacks him and accuses him of planning to leave her. She disrobes, mounts him, and then unexpectedly crushes his testicles with a block of wood. While he is unconscious from the pain, she goes on to masturbate him until he orgasms, ejaculating blood. Then, to prevent him from leaving, she drills a hole through his leg and bolts a heavy grind-stone through the wound. She tosses the wrench she used under the cabin where he cannot find it. He wakes up, finds himself alone, and drags himself outside. He hears her screaming for him, so he drags himself into a fox-hole to hide. As she searches for him he finds a crow buried alive in the fox-hole. The crow starts cawing loudly and repetitively, which lets her find his hiding spot. He beats the crow over and over, but it will not die. She finds him and tries to pull him out. She is unsuccessful and goes on to retrieve a shovel to inflict more pain while he lies in the fox hole, now partially buried alive. Chapter Four: The Three Beggars: Several hours pass. Night falls, and she apologizes to him, weeping profusely. She tries to find the wrench to unbolt the grind-stone, but cannot locate it. With a joint effort they are able to drag him back inside the cabin. He asks her if she wanted to kill him and she answers "not yet", adding cryptically that "when the three beggars arrive someone must die." There is a flash-back to an alternate view of the prologue in which she sees what was about to happen to Nick and does not act. It is unclear whether this is meant to be reality or merely an imagined vision symptomatic of extreme guilt. She then takes a pair of scissors and severs her clitoris while masturbating, letting out a tortured scream. During the night the couple are visited by the crow, the deer, and the fox. Hail beats against the roof of the cabin. Earlier it had been revealed that women in Ratisbon had been accused of witchcraft and had been known to have the power to summon hailstorms. The crow is heard making the same cawing sound beneath the floorboards of the cabin. Breaking through the floor he frees the bird and discovers the wrench. At this moment she stabs him in the back with a pair of scissors, but he is still able to remove the grind-stone. She stops fighting him after noticing a change of look in his eyes. He strangles her to death and burns her body on a funeral pyre outside the cabin. Epilogue: With background music again from Lascia ch\'io pianga, he makes his way from the cabin, eating wild berries, as the three beggars look on. Upon reaching the top of a hill he looks down to see hundreds of women ascending towards him, their faces blurred.'] ['Yoshioka, an experienced detective, investigates the murder of an unknown woman in a red dress.

While one claims to be a witch out of persuasion from the church, one doesn't deny it and curses the priest. He kills them by hanging and implores the guards to pull them back up for a ritual that will make the so-called witches never come back to life, but the guards refuse, claiming them to be dead enough. Afraid that they would come back, the priest returns late at night alone and performs the ritual to prevent the bodies from coming back to life. While successfully completing the ritual for the first two of the bodies, the third one, who happens to be the one who claimed to be a herbalist, takes on a demonic appearance and kills the priest. Later, in the 14th century, Teutonic Knights Behmen von Bleibruck  and Felson  are engaged in a crusade, taking part in several different battles throughout the 1330s and eventually taking part in the Smyrniote crusades. After witnessing the massacre of civilians during the 1344 capture of Smyrna, the two knights choose to desert the Order and the crusade and return to Austria. While traveling through Styria, they encounter the grotesque sight of people infected with the Black Death and soon discover that the Holy Roman Empire has been swept by the plague. Behmen and Felson enter the medieval town of Marburg, the German name for Maribor . The two try to conceal their identity as deserters, but are revealed as knights by the crest on Behmen's sword. He and Felson are then arrested. They are taken to Cardinal D'Ambroise , who is infected with the plague. The Cardinal asks the knights to escort an alleged witch suspected of causing the plague to a remote monastery where an elite group of monks reside. These monks are capable of determining if the girl is truly a witch. If she is found guilty, the monks know a sacred ritual that can cancel her powers and stop the plague that is devastating Europe. The two knights agree under the condition that she will be given a fair trial and that the charges of desertion against them are dropped. The Cardinal agrees and they set out accompanied by a priest Debelzeq ; Kay von Wollenbarth , a young altar boy who wants to become a knight like his deceased father; Eckhart , a knight whose family were killed by the plague; and the well-traveled swindler Hagamar ([[Stephen Graham  who is serving as their guide to the monastery in return for a pardon.

Eckhart volunteers to watch the witch for the first night. After a while, Debelzeq comes to relieve Eckhart, who decides to remain with him. He tells Debelzeq about his daughter Mila, who resembled Anna. When Eckhart gets up to leave, Anna becomes hysterical at the prospect of being left alone with the priest. She attacks him and grabs his key to the cage. She escapes and flees toward a nearby village. The search for her leads the group to a mass grave, where Eckhart has visions of his dead daughter. Running after the visions, he impales himself on Kay's sword and dies. When they recapture her, the tearful Anna explains that she only ran away for fear of Debelzeq. However the group becomes less trusting of Anna. The group manages to cross a rickety rope bridge, during which Anna saves Kay from falling to his death by grabbing him with one hand, showing an unnatural strength. The group enters the dark forest called Wormwood, where Hagamar attempts to kill Anna so the group can go home, only to be stopped by the others. Anna appears to summon wolves, who chase the group and kill Hagamar. An enraged Behmen tries to kill Anna, but is stopped by Debelzeq and Felson, who point out that the monastery is in sight. Arriving at the monastery, the men find all of the monks have been killed by the plague but locate the Key of Solomon, an ancient book filled with holy rituals used to defeat evil. The men confront Anna, with Debelzeq beginning to perform a ritual used on witches. However, as Anna begins precisely recounting Behmen's past actions during the Crusades, Debelzeq comes to the realization that she is not a witch, and begins frantically performing an exorcism. However, the demon that is possessing Anna reveals itself and melts the metal of the cage. The demon effortlessly fights off the knights, but when Debelzeq throws a vial of holy water on it, it flies out of sight. As the men search for the demon, they come to the realization that it isn't trying to escape, but trying to destroy the book so that nothing can stop it. When they find a room where the monks were writing copies of the book, the demon appears, destroys the copies and possesses the dead monks' bodies to use as weapons.

The trial begins with the calling of several medical experts by the prosecutor, Ethan Thomas. One expert testifies that Emily was suffering from both epilepsy and psychosis. The defense contests that she may have actually been possessed, though Bruner is careful never to say that in so many words. Indeed, Bruner explains that Emily was suffering from something that neither medicine nor psychology could explain, and that Moore as well as her family realized this and tried to help in another way. Several flashbacks show how this began. In a flashback, Emily\'s ordeal is shown. Alone in her dorm room one night, at 3:00 AM, Emily notices a strange burning smell coming from the hallway. When she checks on it, she sees the door open and shut by itself several times. When she goes back to her room, she sees a jar of pencils and pens move by itself. Additionally, her bedclothes roll themselves down and a great weight seems to press down on her, a force which also proceeds to choke her. Through these episodes, she wonders if they are really happening or if they are just hallucinations. She suffers more visions, is hospitalized, and diagnosed with epilepsy. She is given anti-seizure medications, which she claims do not work. Her visions continue, as do her severe bodily contortions. She leaves school and returns to live with her parents. She and her parents become convinced she is neither epileptic nor mentally ill, but is possessed by demons. They ask for their local parish priest to be called in to perform an exorcism, and the Church agrees. The prosecution argues that all this could be explained by a combination of epilepsy  and psychosis . As the trial proceeds, Bruner begins to experience strange occurrences in her apartment at 3:00 AM, including strange smells and sounds. Moore warns her that she may be targeted by demons for possibly exposing them. Later in the film, he explains that 3:00 AM is the "devil\'s hour," which evil spirits use to mock the Holy Trinity. Significantly, it is the opposite of 3:00 PM, traditionally taken to be the hour at which Jesus died. Seeing that the prosecution is putting up a seemingly solid medical case, Bruner decides to try to show that Emily may have actually been possessed. She calls in Dr. Sadira Adani, a professor in anthropology and psychiatry, to testify about various cultures\' beliefs about spiritual possession. Adani quotes Carlos Castaneda\'s A Separate Reality as means to understand the subject, and suggests that Emily was a hypersensitive. Thomas objects, and dismisses the testimony as pseudoscience. Dr. Cartwright, a medical doctor present during the exorcism, comes forward to reveal an audio recording made during the rite. Moore is then called to the stand to testify. The recording is played, and the film then flashes back to the exorcism. It is performed on Halloween night, because Moore believes it might be easier to draw out the demons on that night. Emily breaks her ties and jumps out a window, running into a barn. They follow her, and inside the barn, they are subjected to such phenomena as unnatural gusts of wind and demonic screams and voices. The demon inside Emily refuses to name itself after repeated demands from the presiding Father, but finally reveals contemptuously that there are not one but six demons. They go on to identify themselves in dramatic fashion, naming themselves one after another in dual voices from Emily. They identify themselves as the demons who possessed Cain, Nero, and Judas Iscariot, as well as the demons Legion, Belial, and Lucifer himself. Each manifests himself in corresponding native language: Hebrew , Latin ("Ego sum qui , ancient Greek , German  and Aramaic  consecutively. Emily then finally utters in English "And I am Lucifer, devil in the flesh". Bruner calls Moore back to the stand the next day. He reads a letter that Emily wrote before she died. In the letter, Emily describes another vision she had the morning after the exorcism. She walks out of the house and experiences a Marian apparition, in which she is told that although the demons will not leave her, she can leave her body and end her suffering. However, the apparition goes on to say that, if Emily returns to her body, she will help to prove to the world that God and the devil are real. Emily chooses to return, concluding the letter by saying: "People say that God is dead. But how can they think that if I show them the devil?" She then receives stigmata, which Moore believes is a sign of God\'s love for her. Thomas counters that she could have incurred the wounds by self-injury. Father Moore is ultimately found guilty; however, on a recommendation from the jury, the judge agrees to a sentence of time served. Bruner is offered a partnership at her firm, but she refuses and instead, she resigns. She goes with Moore to Emily\'s grave, where he has put a quote  from the second chapter twelfth verse of Philippians on her grave: "Work out your own salvation, with fear and trembling."'] ['Scott stars as Dr. John Russell, a composer living in New York City who moves cross-country to Washington state following the deaths of his wife and daughter in a traffic accident while on a winter vacation in upstate New York.

Andy tries to get the doll back by sneaking into Shelton\'s room, but Shelton catches him in the act. Upon realizing the doll has vanished, Shelton suspects it stolen and forces all the cadets to do exercises in the courtyard as punishment. Andy tries to warn Tyler about Chucky, but is initially unheeded. At one point, Chucky lures Tyler into playing hide-and-seek in Cochran\'s office, where he attempts to possess the boy again. However, they are interrupted by DeSilva and, moments later, Cochran himself. When the cadets leave, Cochran is confronted by a knife-wielding Chucky. The resulting shock causes Cochran to suffer a fatal heart attack.

However, Chucky secretly replaces the paint bullets of one team with live ammunition. When the simulation begins, Chucky accosts Tyler, then threatens the boy when he refuses to take part. Tyler stabs Chucky with a pocket knife and flees, trying to find Andy. Chucky then attacks DeSilva and holds her hostage, attempting to lure the teams into fighting each other to save her. Chucky forces Andy to exchange DeSilva for Tyler. Suddenly, the red team descends upon the area and obliviously opens fire with their live rounds. Shelton is killed in the crossfire. Amidst the chaos, Tyler makes a quick getaway, but before giving chase, Chucky tosses a live grenade at the quarreling cadets. Recognizing the danger, Whitehurst bravely leaps on top of the grenade and sacrifices himself to save the others. With no time to mourn his friend, Andy heads off in pursuit of Chucky, with DeSilva close behind. Eventually the chase leads the group into a haunted house at a nearby carnival. Ronald tries to get a security guard to help him, but Chucky kills the guard off screen and kidnaps Tyler. In the ensuing melee, Chucky shoots DeSilva in the leg, leaving Andy to fight Chucky alone, once again. When Tyler is inadvertently knocked out, Chucky seizes the opportunity to possess him, but Andy intervenes, shooting him several times.

As the claw advances to attack Chase, Heather screams waking up in her bed with Chase, during an earthquake in Los Angeles. After the earthquake dies down, Chase has a couple of scratches, which are the very same as he had received in the dream.

The children, Anne  and Nicholas ([[James Bentley , have an uncommon disease, xeroderma pigmentosa, characterized by photosensitivity, so their lives are structured around a series of complex rules designed to protect them from inadvertent exposure to sunlight. The new arrival of three servants at the house &mdash; an aging nanny and servant named Mrs. Bertha Mills , an elderly gardener named Mr. Edmund Tuttle , and a young mute girl named Lydia  &mdash; coincides with a number of odd events, and Grace begins to fear that they are not alone. Anne draws pictures of four people: a man, a woman, a boy called Victor, and an old woman, all of whom she says she has seen in the house. A piano is heard from inside a locked room when no one is inside. Grace finds and examines a "book of the dead," which shows mourning portraits taken in the 19th century of recently deceased corpses. Doors which Grace believes to have been closed are found mysteriously ajar. Grace tries hunting down the "intruders" with a shotgun but cannot find them. She scolds her daughter for believing in ghosts &mdash; until she hears them herself. Eventually, convincing herself that something unholy is in the house, she runs out in the fog to get the local priest to bless the house. Meanwhile, the servants, led by Mrs. Mills, are clearly up to something of their own. The gardener buries a headstone under autumn leaves, and Mrs. Mills listens faithfully to Anne\'s allegations against her mother. Outside, Grace loses herself in the heavy fog, but she miraculously discovers her husband Charles , who she thought had been killed in the war, and brings him back to the house. Charles is distant during the one day he spends in the house, and Mrs. Mills is heard telling Mr. Tuttle, "I do not think he knows where he is." Grace later sees an old woman dressed up like her daughter. Grace says, "You are not my daughter!" and attacks her. However, she finds that she has actually attacked her daughter instead. Anne refuses to be near her mother afterward, while Grace swears she saw the old woman. Mrs. Mills tells Anne that she too has seen the people, but they cannot yet tell the mother because Grace will not accept what she is not ready for. Charles is stunned when Anne tells him the things her mother did to her. He says he must leave for the front and disappears again. After Charles leaves, Anne continues to see things, including Victor\'s whole family and the old woman. Grace breaks down to Mrs. Mills, who claims that "sometimes the world of the dead gets mixed up with the world of the living."  One morning, Grace wakes to the children\'s screams: all of the curtains in the house have disappeared, as Anne had said they might. When the servants refuse to help look for them, Grace realizes that they are somehow involved. Hiding the children from the light, she banishes the servants from the house. A series of loud noises from the upper storey of the house follows this event. That night, Anne and Nicholas sneak out of the house to find their father and stumble across the hidden graves. They find that the graves belong to the servants. At the same time, Grace goes to the servants\' quarters and finds a photograph from the book of the dead and is horrified to see that it is of the three servants. The servants appear and follow after the children, who make it back into the house just as Grace emerges to hold off the servants with a shotgun. They then say that they had died of tuberculosis more than 50 years before. The children run upstairs and hide, but are found by the strange old woman. Downstairs, the servants continue talking to Grace, telling her that the living and the dead have to learn to live together. Upstairs, Anne and Nicholas discover the old woman is acting as a medium in a séance with Victor\'s parents. It is then that they learn the truth: the real ghosts are none other than Anne, Nicholas, and their mother, who is believed to have killed them in a fit of psychosis before committing suicide. Grace loses her temper and supernaturally attacks the visitors by ripping and throwing pieces of paper that lay on the table. However, the visitors are only able to see the paper ripping of its own accord, further confirming Grace and her children are indeed the ghosts. The truth finally clear to Grace, she breaks down with the children and remembers what happened just before the arrival of their new servants. Stricken with grief for her missing husband and increasingly frustrated by living in isolation, she went insane, smothered her children with a pillow, and then, in shock after realizing what she had done, put a rifle to her forehead and pulled the trigger. When nothing happened and upon hearing the laughter of Nicholas and Anne, Grace assumed that God had granted her family a miracle by offering them a second chance at life. Grace and the children realize that Charles is also dead, but he is not aware of it. Mrs. Mills appears and informs Grace that they will learn to get along, and sometimes won\'t even notice the living people who inhabit their house. She also informs them that since the children no longer have their mortal bodies, they are no longer sensitive to light, and for the first time the children freely enjoy the sunlight coming through the windows. From the window, Grace and her children look out as Victor\'s family moves out.'] ["There are 666 portals on Earth that connect this world to the other side which are concealed from human beings.

Father August, the local preacher, calls the famous witch hunter Father Solomon to help them, but the townspeople decide to venture into the Wolf\'s lair to destroy it. They divide into groups, with one consisting of Peter, Henry and Adrian. Peter separates from them moments before the Wolf attacks and murders Adrian. However, it is cornered by the men and killed. Valerie finds Suzette mourning Adrian and figures out that he was her love. She also realizes that Lucie, being the older daughter, should\'ve been the first to wed and should\'ve been engaged to Henry, but could not as she was the illegitimate daughter of Adrian, making her Henry\'s half sister. The following day, as the people celebrate, Father Solomon arrives and reveals that, had they killed the Wolf, it would have returned to its human form as it is a werewolf, but what they slew was a common grey wolf. He also reveals that they\'ve entered the Blood Moon Week, an event that happens every 13 years, in which whoever is bitten by the Wolf is cursed to become one as well.

Valerie dreams that the Wolf is her Grandmother, who lives in a cabin in the nearby woods, so she goes to check on her. Father Solomon, having been cursed, is killed by the Captain. After retrieving Father Solomon\'s hand, Valerie rushes to her Grandmother\'s cabin, but is confronted on the way by Peter. Noticing that his hand is burned in the same place where the Wolf burned its paw trying to enter the church, Valerie assumes Peter is the Wolf and stabs him. Arriving at Grandmother\'s house, Valerie is horrified to find her dead, and learns that the Wolf is her father, Cesaire. He reveals that the curse was passed to him by his own father, and he intended to leave the village but wanted to take his children with him. He sent a note to Lucie pretending to be Henry to meet him at night so he could ask her to accept her "gift". However, upon confronting her, he couldn\'t communicate with her, and, realizing she was not his daughter, murdered her in a fit of rage. He then took revenge against Adrian, his wife\'s lover, and now wants Valerie to accept the curse. Valerie refuses, just as Peter appears and confronts Cesaire, who bites Peter and tosses him aside. Peter is able to throw an axe into Cesaire\'s back, distracting him. Valerie stabs Cesaire to death with Father Solomon\'s hand. Together, Valerie and Peter fill Cesaire\'s body with rocks so he can never be found and dumps the body in the river. Peter departs in order to learn how to control his curse, vowing to return only when he\'s able to ensure Valerie\'s safety. Valerie narrates that Henry found his courage and honor protecting the village, her mother finally accepts that her husband will never come home, and the village continues to live in fear even though the wolf never returned. She then moves to her grandmother\'s house, leaving her old life behind. In an alternative cut of the ending Valerie is seen holding a baby when Peter arrives. This is possibly his child but the scene was cut for unknown reasons. The last scene shows Valerie outside the cabin on a full moon. She hears a slight growl, turns around and sees the wolf.'] ["Kristen , Joey , and Kincaid  have been released from the Westin Hills Asylum and are now living normal lives and attending high school.

She has also found herself a boyfriend, Rick , a martial arts enthusiast who is also Alice's brother. Kristen begins to have bad dreams and feels as though Freddy has once again come back from the dead. During one of her nightmares, she pulls Kincaid and Joey into her dream as she explores the deserted Elm Street house. The boys try to convince her that Freddy has not come back, and puts her hand on one of the furnaces, showing that the boiler room is empty and cold. Kincaid's dog Jason then jumps out of the boiler and bites Kristen's arm. Kristen wakes up and discovers the bite marks on her arm; while Kincaid wakes up and sees blood dripping from Jason's mouth. In school the next day, Kincaid and Joey confront Kristen about pulling them into the dream. Kincaid wakes up one night and finds himself locked in the trunk of an old junked car. When he opens the hood, he realizes that he is in the same salvage yard that Freddy's body was buried in. Kincaid spies his dog, Jason, digging and urinating fire in the ground nearby. Freddy then resurrects from the ground and goes after Kincaid. After Kincaid unsuccssessfully tries to kill him by knocking a pile of junked cars down on him, Freddy traps and kills Kincaid. Later that night, Joey finds a naked woman swimming in his water bed, but Freddy bursts out seconds later and kills him. The following day at school, Kristen is concerned when her friends fail to show up for class. She confides to Alice about nightmares. Kristen hits her head and passes out when she discovers both of her friends were killed, being attacked by Freddy but revived in time. After she learns of the deaths of Kincaid and Joey, Kristen goes to the actual Elm Street house, with Rick, Dan, and Alice. Rick tells Dan the story of Freddy, and Alice reveals a part of a rhyme by the name of The Dream Master. Alice suggests to Kristen that she is in control of her own dreams. However, Alice also looks down at the ground and sees something, a sidewalk chalk drawing of the house, that only Kristen has been able to see. Clearly, she senses something. At home that night, her mother secretly slips a sedative into her drink to forcibly put her to sleep. Kristen replies angrily to this, and runs upstairs in fear. She quickly falls asleep. On Alice's advice, she tries to convert nightmares into pleasant dreams. At first this works, and she proceeds to dream about a sandy beach vacation spot. While she meets a child named Alice creating a sand castle in her dream, Freddy appears and ruins everything, eventually taking Kristen to his boiler room. It is explained that Kristen is the last child from Elm Street, and Freddy needs her help to get more children. Freddy taunts her long enough to make her scream for Alice. Alice appears suddenly in the boiler room and Kristen tries to get her to wake up but to no avail. Krueger attempts to kill Kristen's friend in front of her, but she jumps in front of Alice, and Freddy throws Kristen into a furnace and collects her soul along with the other Dream Warriors. Before Kristen dies, she sends her power to pull people into her dreams, to Alice's body. Alice awakens immediately, realizing that Kristen is in danger, and she and Rick both quickly make their way to Kristen's house. Outside, they see flames coming from Kristen's room, and they are too late to save her. As Alice tries to understand what has happened, and exactly who Freddy is, her friends begin to die. The next day at school, while taking a test, Alice falls asleep in class and accidentally pulls Sheila into her dream where Freddy is waiting.

Alice awakens, only to discover Sheila having an asthma attack. Sheila then dies after her inhaler ultimately fails. Later, Rick finds himself fighting an invisible Freddy and seems to win when he knocks his glove off. The glove stirs and soon launches at Rick and stabs him in the stomach. After every death, including Kristen's, Alice picks up new talents and traces of the former owner's personality. She also picks up the dream powers of the children who have died. She is obviously Freddy's supernatural opposite, albeit too weak to truly conquer or even resist him yet. After Rick's funeral, Alice teams up with Dan Jordan, who was one of Rick's closest friends.

The couple is on the verge of their first wedding anniversary, and though they are happy, the thorn in the side of their relationship is Ryan\'s brother Roman . Where Ryan comes across as an honest and sweet man, Roman is the direct opposite. Roman is moody and violent, particularly with his casual girlfriend Casey , and Jess is terrified of him, particularly as she met Ryan through Roman when she represented him in court on an aggravated assault charge. When Roman overhears Jess and Ryan discussing their plans to send him to a halfway house, he packs his bags and leaves in his car. Jess calls Ryan, worried about what the impulsive Roman will do, and Ryan quickly heads home in his car. As the brothers cross the Golden Gate Bridge, they crash into one another and are both seriously injured. Jess goes to the hospital and learns that both Roman and Ryan are in comas. Casey arrives and shares a few words with Jess, who promises to keep her updated. Later, Jess gets her mail and finds one of Ryan\'s weekly handwritten love letters. After several weeks, Roman suddenly awakens--but he immediately claims to be Ryan, begging Jess to believe that he is her husband returned to her in his brother\'s body. He implies that something supernatural happened when their bodies were revived side by side on the road, but cannot explain the phenomenon. Jess is initially doubtful and hostile towards Roman, believing that he is disoriented from his head injuries, and she employs Casey\'s help in trying to get him to regain his memories. However, he maintains that he is Ryan, continually offering romantic gestures and recounting specific memories private to them. Eventually, after a year passes, once he accurately recalls the story behind a certain photograph of the two of them, she believes that he is truly her husband and they resume their romantic life. Despite the disapproval of Jess\' co-workers and a harsh reaction from Casey, who still believes that he is actually Roman, Jess and Ryan fall back into their former happy marriage, although Jess is still hesitant to turn off the machines keeping Ryan\'s body alive. They are both soon thrilled by the news that Jess is pregnant. Casey goes missing, but when the police question them, Ryan merely says that she was "troubled." Jess notices a discrepancy in a necklace that Ryan gave her before his accident, but brushes it aside until she discovers the original necklace hidden in a picture frame. She then discovers that the box in which she kept all of Ryan\'s many love letters and photographs has been broken into, and she realizes that Roman has in fact lied to her, having previously studied the pictures and letters to learn the details of their marriage to impersonate his brother. When she confronts him, he quickly grows violent with her, saying that he did it because he loved her and knew they were meant to be together, saying that she must have sensed that it was him all along, and it is revealed that he murdered Casey because of her suspicions. As Roman and Jess fight, Ryan, in the hospital, experiences a seizure. Jess finally manages to stab Roman with a pottery knife, and he dies as the doctors work on Ryan. Later, at the hospital, Jess learns that her baby sustained no injuries from Roman\'s attack and that Ryan managed to pull through his episode, and she sits by his bedside, promising to wait for him and start their life over once he returns to her.  There is a 30 minute alternate ending on the DVD that fundamentally reconstructs the narrative. This ending is similar to the Korean original. Jess and Roman/Ryan decide to turn off Ryan\'s machines, and he dies and is cremated. Rather than being murdered by Roman, Casey merely moves away. Jess realizes that Roman has lied to her by reading Ryan\'s love letters, but decides to feign ignorance and continue their life together, apparently appreciative of the fact that he so desperately wanted to change for her, echoing the theme of "change is choice" as stated in earlier scenes.'] ['Simon Cable wakes up in a hospital bed, confused and disoriented.

Jonesy sees Duddits beckoning him to cross the street, but as he does so Jonesy is hit by a car. His injuries heal with mysterious speed and 6 months later he is able to make the group\'s annual trip. Jonesy and Beaver meet a man lost in the forest named Rick McCarthy . He is very ill so the group lets him rest inside their cabin nearby. Military helicopters fly over the area and announce that the area will be quarantined. Jonesy and Beaver return to the cabin to find a deceased Rick in the bathroom, the room covered with moss and gore. A large worm tries to escape from the bathroom after being excreted into the toilet by Rick before he died. Beaver attempts to trap the creature under the toilet lid, but the lamprey-like worm, with multiple rows of razor-sharp teeth, kills him. Jonesy escapes from the cabin but runs into a large alien called Mr. Grey, who possesses Jonesy\'s body. Nearby, Henry and Pete crash their vehicle as they nearly avoid running over a frostbitten woman from Rick\'s original hunting party. Henry walks for help while Pete stays with the woman. She dies and also excretes a worm, which Pete barely manages to kill. Mr. Grey then captures Pete, but Jonesy telepathically warns Henry to stay hidden. Henry returns to the cabin to find Beaver dead and the worm that killed him now laying a group of eggs. In order to kill all of the alien larvae he sets fire to the cabin. Meanwhile, a military unit led by Curtis , seeks to contain everyone exposed to the aliens. Curtis sends Owen  to lead an air strike against the aliens crashed spaceship. The aliens use telepathy to distract the pilots, but the four Apaches and Curtis\' Little Bird massacre most of the aliens with miniguns and missiles.

Sheriff Aaron Whitaker  is called in. The victim\'s temperamental brother Lawrence Burrifors ([[Geoffrey Lewis  arrives at the crime scene and jumps to the conclusion that the girl\'s lover committed the murder, a man whose very name her brother does not know. The town\'s Dr. Drutan  examines the body and pronounces the girl died of a severe blow to the head caused by a human hand. The sheriff continues to investigate the crime and interviews people who knew the victim. Local residents have a variety of theories, including the belief she was killed by wild dogs. A posse soon forms to track down the wild dogs with little success. Burrifors continues to insist the killer to be his sister\'s mysterious lover while the sheriff, in turn, is suspicious of him. The girl\'s sick and dying father Hugh Burrifors , interviewed by the sheriff, warns him of the "Loug Garog". The sheriff does not understand the French term and local Cajun residents are unable to interpret it. The sheriff\'s investigation soon takes him to the plantation home of the wealthy Andrew Rodanthe  and his sister Louise . They are the last of a local family dynasty with a history stretching back over a century. Andrew, who the sheriff suspects had an affair with the victim, claims to have been suffering an attack of malaria the night the girl was killed. The sheriff, suspicious of the temperamental brother Lawrence after he assaults the town doctor , soon arrests him and puts him in jail. While there, the full moon rises again and Lawrence and the sheriff\'s deputy are killed in a vicious attack as the steel bars of the cell are torn from the wall. With the town\'s terrified residents turning into an angry mob and the sheriff now without assistance, Andrew Rodanthe volunteers to become deputy. Andrew and the sheriff return to Hugh Burrifor\'s house and discover the old man has created a voodoo potion that gives off a vapor meant to repel the "Loug Garog". Rodanthe inhales the potion and goes into what appears to be an epileptic seizure. He is taken to the hospital. While there, Andrew\'s sister Louise tells the sheriff she can speak French fluently and would like to talk to Hugh Burrifor about the unexplainable term "Loug Garog". While speaking with the old man, Louise solves the puzzle. "Loug Garog" is a mispronunciation of "Loup-Garou". Translated into English the term means "werewolf". The next scene shows Andrew turning into a werewolf, revealing him to be the elusive killer. Transformed into a werewolf, Andrew violently escapes the hospital and becomes the subject of a man-hunt. Louise talks to Sheriff Whitaker about werewolf folklore. She reveals a family secret that her grandfather used to suffer from unusual spells of sickness, implying he was also a werewolf and Andrew\'s curse was inherited. Louise returns to her plantation home and is alone when Andrew, still in his werewolf form, quietly enters the house. A frightened Louise attempts to corner the werewolf in a burning barn and eventually shoots the creature with what she assumes are blessed bullets. The sheriff arrives on the scene in time to see Andrew return to his human form before dying.'] [' The film is set in an unnamed Brazilian small town. Zé do Caixão , the local undertaker who disdains religion and emotion and who believes the only thing that matters is the "continuity of the blood" , is looking for the "perfect woman" to bear him a superior child who will be immortal. Since his wife Lenita has been found to be unable to bear children, Coffin Joe begins to make advances with Terezinha, the fiancée of Joe\'s friend Antonio. Terezinha scolds him by telling him that Antonio is the only man in her life. During a Catholic holiday, Joe kills his wife Lenita  by tying her up and having a venomous spider bite her. The local authorities cannot find a clue to arrest him and he remains free to do whatever he wants. Some days later, Coffin Joe is invited by Antonio to visit a local gypsy who will tell the fortune of Antonio\'s marriage with Terezinha. The gypsy reveals, however, that there is going to be a tragic disaster, and the two will never get married. Joe, in response, calls her a fraud and states that the supernatural is a hoax. She warns him not to mock the supernatural forces, lest they make him pay. That night, Joe and Antonio go to Antonio\'s house, where Antonio tells Joe that he really didn\'t believe the witch\'s words, and that he expects to marry Terezinha and have a happy life together. Fulfilling the witch\'s prophecy, Coffin Joe brutally bludgeons and then drowns Antonio in a bathtub. Once again, the police can find no evidence to directly implicate Joe with the crime. He proceeds with his plan to seduce Terezinha by purchasing a canary for her, which she accepts. Suddenly he starts to touch her against her will. Terezinha tries to resist, and Coffin Joe savagely beats her into a helpless state and rapes her. Finally able to speak, Terezinha curses him for his brutality, saying she will kill herself, then return to take his soul to hell. Joe laughs at her, but the next day she is found hanging in her home. To his surprise, she doesn\'t blame him in her suicide note. Meanwhile, the village\'s Dr. Rudolfo begins to suspect Joe for the recent outbreak of violent deaths that has occurred. When Joe becomes aware of the doctor\'s suspicions, Coffin Joe appears at Dr. Rudolfo\'s home, gouges his eyes with his long fingernails and sets him on fire. Time passes, and Coffin Joe remains unpunished for his crimes. On the Day of the Dead he meets Marta, a young woman who is visiting her relatives, and decides to choose her as his next perfect woman. Joe escorts Marta home late at night, only to be confronted by the gypsy who predicted the doom of Antonio and Terezinha. She tells Joe that his soul shall be claimed by the ghosts of those he murdered and Satan at midnight. Joe threatens the gypsy, but after leaving Marta at her destination, he is soon visited by ghostly apparitions that test his courage. Realizing he cannot face the apparitions, Joe runs away, and coincidentally arrives at the mausoleum where Antonio and Terezinha were buried. Finally at the edge of his sanity, Joe opens the coffins to prove to himself his victims are really dead, but instead sees that their eyes are open, as if they are still alive, faces crawling with maggots. Some time later, the villagers come to the mausoleum after hearing Coffin Joe\'s blood-curdling screams and find him lying on his back, horribly disfigured, his eyes bulging open similar to the eyes of the two corpses. At that same time, the bells of the local church ring, announcing the stroke of midnight.'] ["Norman Taylor , a psychology professor lecturing in belief and superstition, discovers that his wife Tansy  is practicing witchcraft. She insists that her charms have been responsible for his academic career, despite him being the youngest and newest among his colleagues, and his well being. A firm rationalist and angry at her superstition, Taylor forces her to burn all magical objects in the house. Almost immediately things start to go wrong: A female student accuses him of violation, her boyfriend threatens him, and an unseen menace tries to break into their home. Tansy, willing to sacrifice her life for her husband's, almost drowns herself and is, as the film suggests, only saved in the last minute by Taylor giving in to the practices he despises. Later, Tansy attacks him with a knife, but he manages to disarm her and lock her in her room. Her limping walk during the attack gives Taylor a hint where to find the person responsible for his ill luck. He identifies university secretary Flora Carr , wife of a colleague whose career stalled in favour of Norman's, as the perpetrator. Flora has his home, where Tansy is still locked in, go up in flames.

The parents notice a stranger stalking them over the course of a few weeks, and discover, over lunch with him, that his name is Elliot Hoover , and that he is convinced their daughter is a reincarnation of his daughter Audrey Rose, who died in a fiery car accident, along with his wife, two minutes before Ivy was born. Hoover had come to believe this through information given to him by two clairvoyant psychics. Bill asks a friend of his, an attorney, to hide in their apartment to hear Hoovers full story to build a case against him, but when Hoover speaks Audrey\'s name out loud, Ivy hears him from her room and enters an altered state where she cannot be calmed down without the assistance of Hoover. In this state, she bangs her hands on a window and becomes burned, which Hoover says is a result of his daughter\'s experience of being burned alive in the car. Janice is afraid of Hoover but is also concerned for her daughter, while Bill is hostile to Hoover and demands he stay away. Ivy continues to be disturbed by nightmares which keep getting worse. Hoover appears at their home during one of her nightmares, and at the request of the mother Hoover is able to calm Ivy down by calling to her as Audrey Rose, but is arrested for allegedly briefly abducting her to his recently rented upstairs apartment. The film then moves forward some months to an ongoing trial, where Hoover is attempting to persuade a jury that his actions were necessary to grant his daughter\'s spirit peace. The trial has become a worldwide phenomenon, with a Hindu holy man giving an explanation of reincarnation as testimony. Hoover testifies in court that after his daughter\'s death, Hoover had traveled to India and become a believer in reincarnation and Hinduism. Janice comes to believe Hoover\'s story, and testifies as much, but Bill does not, and has their lawyer request Ivy be hypnotized to show she is not a reincarnation of Audrey Rose.

The last scene is Janice writing a letter to Hoover thanking him for transporting Ivy/Audrey\'s ashes to India, and indicating this is with her husband\'s permission, who she says has started to accept what she and Hoover believe to be true. The movie closes on a quotation from the Bhagavad-Gita:  "There is no end. For the soul there is never birth nor death. Nor, having once been, does it ever cease to be. It is unborn, eternal, ever-existing, undying and primeval..."'] ['A family driving through the U.S. state of New Mexico discover an old ghost town, Weaver, and stop to take snapshots. Patrons at an estranged diner, in a lobotomized or brainwashed state, claim to not have heard of Weaver, although a gas-station attendant warns Jim Henley to "stay on the pavement". Henley, his wife Patty, his son Matt, along with Matt\'s friend Ethan and sister Kate make their way to the ghost town, discovering mysterious symbols and a human-sized dry skin on a wall, also discovering a video tape, which reveals previous visitors were taken by an unseen force, ending with a girl running from the unseen threat. The car, an SUV, is disabled and the family is forced to spend the night in one of the abandoned buildings. The unseen person/force steals their car, along with a flashlight and Jim\'s sweater. The next day, the family discovers the car has been stolen. Deciding to split up, Kate, Patty, and Matt remain in the building while Jim and Ethan set out for the diner. Ethan is attacked by a snake in the desert, but it only bites his wallet. Jim and Ethan also discover a large expanse of glass in the middle of the desert - a plaque in the centre of which reveals it to be a 1948 neutron bomb test site called, naturally enough, "Ground Zero". Ethan vanishes when walking just ahead of Jim over a ridge, and Jim runs off to a nearby car graveyard glimpsed in the distance, where many stolen vehicles, including his SUV are parked in the same fashion as the symbol on the wall. Meanwhile, Patty goes to use the bathroom, notices someone watching her, but falls through rotten boards into a mine shaft. Patty hears growling sounds from below, and climbs further up, discovering many stolen items including a familiar sweater. Matt and Kate search for Patty until Matt finds her, climbing down the mine to help her. The source of the sound, one of the unseen stalkers seen only from 1st person camera movement, makes its way faster to Patty and Matt, however before it can do anything, Patty shoots at it with a gun, though no body is discovered and it is uncertain whether it was harmed. Jim rescues them in the SUV after evading another one or more of the mysterious creatures attempting to prevent him recovering a battery for the car from the vehicle graveyard, only for their way out of Weaver to be blocked by a seemingly driverless school-bus and truck, forcing Jim to drive them both through a clapboard outbuilding to escape. They stop to use a telephone at the diner, but it is useless. Jim and Matt spot a dust cloud moving in their direction from the vicinity of Weaver. Jim visits Sheriff Richards in the nearby town of Two Wells, telling him about Ethan\'s disappearance, the town of Weaver, where the townspeople vanished without a trace, and the unseen beings attacking them. The Sheriff denies all knowledge of the town, but while he is away, Jim is pulled aside by an old inmate named Lester, who gives him a possible explanation, telling him the town does exist and the unseen force is possibly the mutated, deformed offspring of the townspeople, reminiscent of The Hills Have Eyes, who refused evacuation before the bomb was dropped, or the spirits of Indians interred in a burial ground under the town, also mentioning Area 51, although telling Jim aliens are not necessarily the explanation for the unseen forces in Weaver - whether this is anything to do with the truth or simply the ramblings of a madman is never made clear. Kate finds the girl from the video apparently alive, working at the local Dairy Queen, though by the time the family return to confirm this she\'s \'gone off-shift\' and is nowhere to be seen. The family stays at a motel, after the Sheriff agrees to search for Ethan the next day. Kate senses one of the beings watching them from the window, prompting them to decide to leave at once. Sheriff Richards, as a possible sacrifice and exchange, or because of his revelation to Jim, takes Lester to the desert, lights a fire, and leaves him for \'the beings\'. Jim and Patty take Matt and Kate, attempting to flee, but are stopped by the Sheriff, who first attempts to dissuade them from leaving and eventually tells them that he found Ethan. The four of them pick up Ethan, Jim seeing Lester\'s empty cell. Meanwhile, as the five of them flee, Ethan tells them he fell and does not remember anything else, while Matt questions the events. As Jim is distracted, the car hits what appears to be an animal, possibly possessed by the Indian spirits, or one of the unseen mutants, causing the SUV to flip over. The viewpoint of one of the unseen creatures makes its way to the wrecked car, only their screams being heard afterwards. Six Months later, Jim is now the gas-station attendant, while Patty works as the waitress in the diner, all of them in the same lobotomized state as the other members of the town of Two Wells, New Mexico. After Kate has served Sheriff Richards at the diner, the film ends with Kate feeding one of the crows as several bikers turn up at the diner, very possibly to begin the cycle all over again.'] ["David Ash , an American professor, has entered into the field of parapsychology and has spent a majority of his life disproving the existence of ghosts. He was motivated by the untimely death of his twin sister, Juliet, for which he blames himself. In 1928, he receives an invitation from the Mariell family to investigate the alleged hauntings at their home, Edbrook House. At the train station, he is met and is immediately smitten by the beautiful Christina Mariell , who informs him that she and her brothers actually hired him to try to calm the fears of their aging nanny. Christina believes that due to her declining mental health since their mother's death, Nanny Tess  has convinced herself that Mrs. Mariell's ghost returns every evening to haunt Edbrook House. As David begins his investigations, he becomes aware of a presence in the house which goes against everything he believes. This strengthens his determination to expose the paranormal activities as nothing more than a hoax perpetrated by younger brother Simon ([[Alex Lowe . His initial ideas regarding the afterlife are shaken by the increasingly vivid visions of his dead sister Juliet, freely prowling the halls or grounds of Edbrook. Unable to sleep from the strange nightly disturbance, David begins to hallucinate, causing him to start questioning the state of his own sanity and to seek the aid of Dr. Doyle , the local psychiatrist. Further complicating the investigation is Christina's continuous flirtation with David, a distraction he gladly welcomes. However, older brother Robert  is adamantly against their friendship, and is revealed as having an incestuous relationship with Christina. When David decides to finally leave Edbrook, he asks Christina to come away with him. Although she refuses, they engage in a passionate kiss and end up in bed together. In the morning when David wakes, the wind is gusting through the house, which is now cloaked in black drapes and littered with fallen leaves. He searches for Christina but instead sees his twin sister's ghost, who leads David to a cemetery. Juliet calls his attention to a specific tombstone which states that Robert, Christina and Simon Mariell all died in a fire at Edbrook in 1923.

They are called to England by a potential client, sight unseen. At first they hesitate since both are already booked to do work for someone in Los Angeles, only a few days post. Suddenly they get a phone call that their local customer has had a fatal accident, which seems awfully coincidental to Pete. Nonetheless, he tags along with Maggie to work for their latest client, who has prepaid Maggie\'s airfare. Arriving in England, Maggie and Pete get into a country road accident, one that involves their motorcycle and a vintage limousine belonging to Jason Mountolive , a moribund and reclusive multi-millionaire . Apologizing for their unfortunate mishap, this independently wealthy Englishman invites the twosome to stay at Ravenhurst: his rambling country estate. But this is no setback; it was Jason himself who arranged Maggie\'s trip here, ostensibly to do interior decorations for Ravenhurst.  Once installed at Ravenhurst, Maggie and Pete get acquainted with Jason\'s five  beneficiaries, including "...a million-dollar prostitute, a star-maker, a nation-killer, a woman whose lust runs cold as graveyard snow..." In other words, various European luminaries who are "beholden" to Jason for helping them with their careers... and with occasional run-ins, public scandals, et al. All five have been summoned to Ravenhurst in a fashion much like Maggie\'s, because Jason is about to die; in fact, he is wasting away upstairs as they speak. Maggie is astonished to hear this; Jason seemed vigorous, almost youthful, when she and Pete first met him.  Jason receives visits from those who have come to see him; indeed, their benefactor lies dying in a sterilized chrome-and-glass-styled bedroom which is equipped with various life-support machines. He calls Maggie to his bed, which is shrouded by white curtains so she cannot see Jason\'s face. Then his hand, which suggests that of a monster, abruptly reaches out and puts a ring on her finger, a ring emblazoned with the Mountolive family crest. After Jason dismisses her, Maggie rejoins the other five guests, who all wear like rings. She tries to remove the ring, but it has grafted itself to her finger. Shortly thereafter, the European guests proceed to die via increasingly mysterious and gruesome means. Maria, despite being an excellent swimmer, somehow becomes trapped under the surface of Jason\'s indoor pool and is drowned. Recording-studio executive Clive Jackson  gets a chicken bone lodged in his throat during dinner and perishes during a botched tracheotomy, although he was having ham and pate but no chicken. Karl Liebnecht , a German military-surplus dealer, is cremated by a massive tongue of flame which spews dragonlike from Ravenhurst\'s fireplace yet leaves the rest of the room he is in untouched. A mirror in Barbara\'s bedroom explodes, impaling her with glass shards like a pincushion, then reforms itself without a crack. Jacques, a hotelier, tries to kill Maggie and Pete because he suspects them of engineering these inexplicable deaths. Just as he gets the drop on them, his shotgun jams and backfires into his face, blowing him off Ravenhurst\'s roof. Amid these bizarre tragedies, Maggie and Pete discover - via newspaper clippings - that their fellow guests were each accused of murder, public-property destruction, or worse... yet never paid for their respective crimes. Maggie also discovers that Jason\'s mother was Lady Margaret Walsingham, while his father was the Lord of Mountolive; both their families were heavily into black magic and witchcraft. Lady Margaret and her husband were burned at the stake for heresy, although their son survived. Maggie realizes that she is Jason\'s great-granddaughter, and has been lured to England accordingly, albeit under false pretenses. Maggie is now the last remaining "seal-bearer," the heir to Jason\'s "Legacy" : ostensibly the Walsingham-Mountolive financial empire, which the other five  beneficiaries ran for him; but also the sinister powers which he used to sacrifice them to the Devil. She returns upstairs to Jason\'s room. With his strength and breath running out, Jason confirms that he was responsible for killing all the other guests. He prepares to pass his Satanic abilities and knowledge on to her, with instructions to choose six heirs of her own; when the proper time comes, Maggie will bring about the deaths of all except one who will inherit the powers of Satan. Pete forces his way into the room and attempts to halt said ceremony by short-circuiting Jason\'s life-support system. But Maggie and the Legacy have already claimed each other; she is now Lady Margaret, with the entire household staff of Ravenhurst at her beck and call.  Maggie selects Pete as her first beneficiary, or "seal-bearer." She gives him a Ravenhurst crest-ring which, sure enough, grafts itself to his finger and the cycle begins anew.'] ['The film starts with a man tied to a ceremonial table. Another man then kills him with ahammer to the face. A journalist, Carmen , is having problems with her relationship with her boyfriend, Marcus  who is a photographer. Carmen never seems to stop thinking about work and tends to ignore him. Carmen asks her boss to allow her to to investigate the disappearances of several tourists in the fictional Polish village of Alvania . The last person to go missing was Eric Taylor , the man killed at the beginning of the film. She also mentions that the luggages of all the missing tourists end up being found all around Eastern Europe. Her boss isn\'t interested in another missing persons case, saying that people go missing all the time and does not give her permission to go. Instead, he would rather have her investigate why a farmer\'s bees go missing. Carmen and her intern Sara  visit Eric\'s mother, Laura. Laura tells them that she has tried to get the help of both the Polish and the American Police. However, they are unwilling or too busy to help her. Carmen asks Laura if Eric\'s luggage has been returned to her. Laura says that it has and Carmen borrows Eric\'s journal. Later in her home while reading Eric\'s journal, she has a dream of Eric with bloody eyes who tells her "leave me alone". Carmen, wanting to mend her relationship with Marcus as well as her job, urges him to come with her and Sara to Alvania. Upon reaching Alvania, they find the village people to be secretive, unfriendly and unwelcoming, just as described in the last entry in Eric\'s journal. Although English is taught in the villages\' school, not all the villagers know how  to speak it. They see a man named Henryk butchering a pig then find a girl named Lidia picking flowers and approach her. They show her a picture of Eric and ask if she has seen him. The girl reacts at the site of Eric in the picture but is hesitant to answer. Before she even can, Henryk calls to her and sends her off. Carmen, Sara and Marcus explore the village. They notice that the villagers treat their religious leaders like royalty. They then spot a strange dense area of fog which seems to be concentrated only in one portion of the forest, also mentioned in Eric\'s notes. They are threatened by Henryk and the villagers and told to leave the village when they attempt to move toward the fog. Leaving the village initially, Carmen tells Marcus that they should go back and investigate the fog. Marcus initially disagrees and insists that they leave. Carmen manages to convince Marcus to return by admitting her editor knows nothing about the trip and that her career will be over if she returns with no story. They leave their car and walk into the forest where they eventually find the area with the fog. Carmen, Sara and Marcus find it strange that the fog seems to never move and is quite dense, therefore preventing Marcus from taking pictures of anything inside the fog. Sara enters the fog and disappears into it. Carmen and Marcus wait for Sara to return but after awhile, they lose their patience. Marcus insists that they leave but they can\'t leave Sara behind. Carmen enters the fog to find Sara. Moments after she enters the fog, Sara somehow gets out and is found by Marcus. Sara appears scared and unfocused. Carmen seems to have gotten lose in the fog and comes across a statue of a demon holding a heart. Carmen takes a picture of it. As she moves to the side of the statue in order to take another picture, the statue turns its head to face Carmen. The statue\'s eyes bleed and the \'heart\' in its hand start to beat. This frightens Carmen. As she backs away from the statue, she find herself out of the fog and is found by Marcus and Sara. Sara and Carmen talk about seeing the statue, both a bit disoriented, also having heard strange whispering voices. As they make their way back to their car, they come arcoss Lidia who claims to know the whereabouts of Eric and takes them to a hidden sacrificial shrine, where they discover the bodies of people  that the village people have executed. Each body has a metal mask deeply embedded on its face, making it look as though the villagers are cultists and are practicing some kind of ritual black magic on the tourists who come to Alvania. Marcus, Sara and Carmen notice that Lidia is gone and finds the door to the shrine barred. Luckily, Marcus is able to open it but they are suddenly surrounded by the villagers and flee, hiding in a nearby barn. They are found and struggle to escape but one of the villagers knocks out Carmen. Henryk shoots Sara\'s leg with a crossbow. The villagers knock her out with chloroform but not before she sees the one of the villagers\' face turn into a demon. Marcus runs into the forest and is chased by Henryk. Henryk catches up with him. Marcus fights Henryk but the latter gains the upper hand and knocks him out with chloroform. As they wake up, they see Henryk talking to Lidia. Lidia walks off and the villagers bring them back to the entrance of the sacrificial shrine where the head of the village\'s church, Arkadiusz, decides to sacrifice both Sara and Carmen. Sara and Carmen are taken inside the shrine while Marcus is led away by two villagers and is forced to dig a grave at gunpoint. After one of them leaves, Marcus uses the shovel to disarm the remaining villager with the gun and knock him unconscious. He takes the gun and runs off to rescue Sara and Carmen. At the shrine, cultists strip Carmen and Sara and don them with ceremonial gowns. The Cultists place Sara on the same ceremonial table where Eric was killed while Carmen is placed in a prison cell. The Cultists secure her arms, legs and head. They then deeply lacerate her arms and sever her Achilles\' tendons. While this is being done to her, she sees the faces of the Cultists and Arkadiusz turn into demons. The same mask they found on the corpses is placed over Sara\'s head. It has two spikes inside of it which are meant to pierce Sara\'s eyes and embed the mask on her face. Arkadiusz takes a sledgehammer and uses it to embed the mask on Sara, executing her in the process. One of the Cultists looks at Carmen and she sees that the Cultist\'s face become that of a demon as well. They bring her out to be sacrificed but Marcus rescues her. He locks the Cultists in the shrine and he and Carmen make their escape. They enter a villager\'s house to steal the keys to a truck. Marcus sees a woman, Emilia, and her son, Dariusz, in the kitchen. The woman calls for her husband, Aleks, but is unable to do anything since Marcus still has the gun. Marcus asks them for the keys to the truck but they can\'t understand English. When they see Carmen, Emilia expresses fear and panic. Marcus takes the family to their living room and ties up the couple. While Marcus tries to get them to give him the keys, Carmen starts to experience voices. She sees the objects in the room shake. She sees Daruisz turn into a demon. She sees Emilia and Aleks turn demonic, untie themselves and crawl on the floor. Marcus turns to Carmen and he too has becomes a demon. But in truth, all of them are still human—Emilia and Aleks are still tied up and none of them are even looking at her. Carmen hides in another room where she continues to see and hear things. Dariusz, who understands and speaks English, leads Marcus back to the kitchen and gives him the truck keys. Not wanting to risk Dariusz going out and calling for help, Marcus also ties him up. The boy begs for Marcus to let them go and warns him that Carmen is evil since she has seen the statue. Carmen is then possessed by a demon while she is alone in the room and lets out a very loud shriek. The cultists, who have gotten free and are looking for Carmen, hear the shriek and are alerted of Carmen\'s location. Marcus hears Carmen calling out to him. He enters the room she went inside through a door from the kitchen. As he enters the room, another door leading back to the living room closes. Marcus hears Aleks and Emilia scream in fear and pain, followed by footsteps going to the kitchen. Marcus then hears Dariusz screaming. As he looks out from the door, he sees the boy being dragged away. The door then closes and Dariusz\'s screaming stops. The door leading to the living room slowly opens. He goes to the living room and finds the entire family brutally killed. A possessed Carmen then jumps on him and pins him on the floor. Just as she is about to kill Marcus, she is confronted by the cultists. She kills several of them. Arkadiusz fights back with prayers and holy water. He calls for the mask but the Cultist holding the mask is stunned in fear, giving the possessed Carmen the opportunity to impale Arkadiusz. Carmen turns her attention back to Marcus. Before Arkadiusz dies, he passes on his duties to Henryk. Henryk chants prayers while splashing Carmen with holy water. Henryk stabs Carmen. The prayers weaken her, allowing Henryk to slowly set on her on the floor. Two more Cultists help. They impale Carmen\'s hands and pin her to the floor. Henryk calls for the mask and this time, the Cultist holding the mask complies. They position the mask over Carmen\'s face while Henryk readies the sledgehammer. However Carmen stills struggles and the mask can\'t be properly placed over her eyes. Marcus now realizes what is going on and understands why it was necessary to kill Sara and Carmen. Sara and Carmen saw the statue which is why the villagers had to kill them but not Marcus. The cultists weren\'t sacrificing anyone. They were trying to prevent demonic possessions from taking place. Knowing this, Marcus helps out Henryk and the others by holding Carmen\'s head still. With the mask now in place, Henryk readies the sledgehammer to embed the mask. Carmen returns to normal and asks Marcus for help but Marcus knows it is just a trick. Henryk sends the sledgehammer down and embeds the mask on Carmen, killing her. Marcus then looks at Henryk and the remaining men, wondering what will happen to him since he knows too much. One of the villagers asks Henryk on what they will do with Marcus. In the end, Marcus is set free by the villagers. Henryk offers to have one of the village\'s men take him to where he needs to go. Marcus looks over to the forest where the fog is seen. Not really knowing what is really inside the fog, he asks Henryk about it. He is told that the fog and the statue are a curse left long ago to the village that cannot be undone. The devilish statue is shown once more and the screen goes black.'] ['Rosanna Arquette stars as Martha Travis, a medium who hosts a touring clairvoyant show with her alcoholic father Walter  where she helps members of the audience make contact with deceased relatives.

They later reconstruct her body and send it to Takaishi Yamamura , Sadako\'s uncle, who takes it on his boat and later casts it into the bottom of the ocean. Mai Takano , Ryuji Takayama\'s assistant, continues to search for answers in regards to his sudden death. She meets a reporter named Okazaki , while looking for Ryuji\'s ex-wife Reiko Asakawa , who is investigating the cursed tape in Reiko\'s stead. Okazaki, still searching for a person who has actually seen the tape with their own eyes, tracks down and interviews a girl named Kanae Sawaguchi . Although she has not yet seen the tape, she agrees to sell him a copy for ¥20,000. Upon giving the tape to Okazaki, Kanae admits that she watched the tape and begs him to watch it to spare her life. However, Okazaki is too afraid to watch it. Okazaki and Mai visit a mental hospital to see Masami Kurahashi , a friend of Tomoko Oishi\'s who saw her killed. Masami is now mute and refuses to leave her room, due to the TV in the lounge area which she has developed an immense phobia of. While there, they meet a university classmate of Takayama\'s, Dr. Kawajiri , who is a prominent paranormal researcher and recognises that Sadako Yamamura\'s lingering hatred resides within the tape and can be transferred to people such as Masami. Determined to remove Sadako\'s spirit from within Masami, who has become imbued with psychic powers after watching the tape and can projects its images onto nearby TV sets, he arranges a risky experiment based on his theories involving energy transfer. The experiment requires Masami to attempt to drain Sadako\'s energy out of her by projecting the images onto a blank tape. Mai warns Masami not to participate, but the experiment goes ahead. Images begin to appear on the TV when there is a massive energy surge and Masami collapses in her chair. Mai takes the opportunity to grab the tape and destroy it. Mai finally meets up with Reiko Asakawa and her son Yoichi , both of whom have been in hiding out of fear from the authorities. Yoichi, having watched the tape, begins exhibiting psychic abilities and has become mute. Meanwhile, Kanae Sawaguchi\'s body is discovered. While trying to erase the footage of Kanae\'s interview Okazaki finds that the tape won\'t erase, and the tape sticks, Kanae\'s face on the screen slowly turning into a ghostly hair-covered face like Sadako\'s. The grinning Kanae comes closer to the screen and Okazaki is seen to scream. Despite trying to keep the Asakawas\' whereabouts hidden, Mai informs the authorities after seeing Kanae\'s body, who close in on Reiko and Yoichi. At the police station, Mai utilizes her limited psychic abilities to tell Yoichi to flee. Yoichi regains his voice and alerts Reiko. They escape, but Reiko experiences a vision in which her late father appears. He tells her that "the child you carry with you isn\'t Yoichi anymore". Reiko is killed by a truck while experiencing the vision. The police arrive and Yoichi focuses his killing intent on one of the detectives for a moment, before Mai interrupts and whisks Yoichi away.

Mai is taken to the River of Offering by Takaishi, and upon returning to the inn she and the doctor see a vision of Shizuko in a scene from the video tape, caused by Yoichi. The next day, Dr. Kawajiri sets his equipment up next to a pool of fresh water which serves to sap Sadako\'s energies from Yoichi with Mai as a channeler. The process suddenly becomes chaotic when Yoichi\'s powers awaken. Takaishi, seeing Sadako\'s coffin in the pool, swims out towards it and is killed while yelling "Take me! End this with me!" The doctor commits suicide by electrocution under Sadako\'s influence, which also kills the nurse trying to stop him. Mai runs to Yoichi before blacking out.

However, Tommy Jarvis, who killed Jason in self defense when he was twelve years old, is still haunted by his encounter despite having been released from the mental institute after an extended period of time. Intent on cremating Jason's body to rid himself of his demons, Tommy, and his friend Hawes, breaks into the cemetery containing Jason's grave. He and Hawes exhume Jason's casket, but before they can cremate the body, an infuriated Tommy begins stabbing it with a steel fence post. Unfortunately, the fence post acts as a lightning rod for an incoming storm, and a bolt of lightning brings Jason back to life. Jason rips Hawes' heart out and throws his body into the exhumed coffin while Tommy escapes. Tommy returns to the town of Crystal Lake, the site of Jason's killings, which has now been renamed Forest Green to distance itself from negative publicity. Tommy attempts to warn the town sheriff, Mike Garris, of Jason's return, but Garris, aware of Tommy's institutionalization, writes him off as mentally disturbed, and has him locked in a holding cell. Meanwhile, Jason begins a trek back to the lake that which was the site of his drowning as a child. En route, he encounters Lizabeth and Darren, a pair of summer camp supervisors, who are themselves headed to the lake to supervise the reopening of the summer camp. Jason attacks and kills them, leaving their bodies in the woods. The next morning, Sheriff Garris's daughter, Megan, who is slated to be one of the camp counselors, arrives with fellow counselors Cort, Sissy, and Paula, to report Lizabeth and Darren missing. Tommy cites their disappearance as evidence of Jason's return, but is met with hostility from everyone but Megan, who takes a liking to him. Sheriff Garris sends the counselors off to the campsite and then escorts Tommy out of town, and en route, Tommy flees to the cemetery to try to show Garris the open grave, only to discover that the groundskeeper, fearful of being implicated for digging up the grave due to his alcoholism, has covered the grave, and, consequently, Hawes's body, with dirt. Garris handcuffs Tommy and takes him to the city limits, warning him not to return. Meanwhile, a quintet of business people playing paintball in the woods are set upon by Jason, who kills them and steals their supplies. That night, Jason continues making his way back to Crystal Lake, in the process killing the grave digger and a nearby couple having a picnic. Cort meets up with a local girl, Nikki, and leaves the camp to have sex with her in the woods, but they end up in Jason's path, and are both subsequently killed by him. Sheriff Garris's Deputy finds the bodies including the corporate executives that were playing paintball, and believes that Tommy has killed them, living out a delusion of Jason's return. Tommy, meanwhile, has contacted Megan, having figured out a way to defeat Jason after having read books on monsters and folklore. He can be incapacitated by being trapped beneath the surface of the lake where he drowned. Megan attempts to bring Tommy back to the camp, but they are intercepted by one of Garris's roadblocks, and Tommy is arrested, and Megan is escorted back to the police station to await her father's return from the field. The police's attention on Tommy permits Jason to slip into the summer camp, where he kills Paula and Sissy, but refrains from harming any of the children. Megan and Tommy escape the police station and make it to the lake, where the pursuing police are forced to acknowledge Jason's return when he attacks them. Garris and his deputies briefly incapacitate Jason by shooting him with high caliber weapons, but Jason ultimately recovers and kills them all including Sheriff Garris by bending him in two. He then attempts to kill Megan, but is distracted by Tommy, who beckons to him from the lake. Seemingly remembering Tommy, Jason abandons Megan and wades out to the lake, where Tommy ambushes him with a chain attached to a large boulder. A fight ensues, during which both Tommy and Jason are knocked into the water, and as Tommy attempts to swim to the surface, Jason pulls him underwater and apparently drowns him. Megan swims out to save Tommy and is likewise attacked by Jason, but finally incapacitates him by ramming a motor boat propeller into his neck and jaw eventually breaking his neck. Back on land, Megan revives Tommy with CPR and the children celebrate. At the bottom of the lake, Jason floats, attached to the boulder, still alive but powerless to escape."] ['{{Plot}} In the prologue, Thomas Dagget  is about to be ordained as a priest of the Roman Catholic Church, but he is stricken by horrific visions of angels at war with each other. Several years later, Thomas, having lost his faith and abandoned the church, is a detective with the Los Angeles Police Department. Two angels fall to Earth: one, Simon , warns Thomas of coming events, before disappearing. The second, Uziel , tracks Simon down and attempts to kill him, but is killed himself. Investigating the disturbance, Thomas goes to Simon\'s apartment and finds an obituary for a recently deceased Korean War veteran named Arnold Hawthorne clipped from a newspaper in Chimney Rock, Arizona. More puzzling, Thomas finds a copy of a theology text that he himself wrote years ago. In Chimney Rock, Simon finds the veteran and removes the soul from the body. The medical examiner informs Thomas that Uziel\'s body is like nothing he has seen before: it has no eyes, no signs of bone growth, hermaphroditism, and the same blood chemistry as an aborted fetus. Among the personal effects found on the body is an ancient, hand-written Bible, which includes a Twenty-Third chapter of the Book of Revelation - a chapter that does not exist in any other version. Thomas translates the chapter and learns of a second war in Heaven, instigated by a group of angels who refused to accept God\'s elevation of man over all other creatures, including angels. The chapter includes a prophecy that a "dark soul" will be found on Earth that can be used as a terrible weapon. Unknown to Thomas, Gabriel  has arrived on Earth. Needing a human helper, Gabriel recruits Jerry , who has been trapped in a state of limbo ever since Gabriel prevented him from dying when he committed suicide. Jerry retrieves Uziel\'s belongings from the police station while Gabriel destroys Uziel\'s body in the morgue. After finding Hawthorne\'s obituary among Simon\'s possessions, Gabriel and Jerry head for Chimney Rock. Before Gabriel arrives, Simon befriends a little girl, Mary , and passes the soul on to her in order to hide it from Gabriel. Mary immediately falls ill and is taken care of by her teacher, Katherine . After finding Uziel\'s immolated body, Thomas decides to go to Chimney Rock. Just outside of the town, Gabriel and Jerry locate Hawthorne\'s body, but the soul is gone. Gabriel locates Simon by scent and confronts him at the school; Simon refuses to tell him where he hid the soul. Gabriel says Hawthorne\'s soul will end the stalemate, tipping the balance to whichever side possesses it. Simon chastises Gabriel for going against the word of God, and finally Gabriel kills Simon by setting him aflame and ripping the heart from his chest. Mary begins showing signs of being possessed by Hawthorne\'s soul. Meanwhile, Thomas arrives in Chimney Rock, examines Simon\'s remains, and questions Katherine. He searches Hawthorne\'s home and finds evidence of a court martial in which Hawthorne was accused of a number of war crimes, including cannibalism. Thomas visits a church to reflect and is shaken by a confrontation with Gabriel. Katherine arrives at school the next day to find Gabriel questioning the children. He leaves, and she rushes to Mary\'s home to find Thomas there. Mary\'s condition is worsening. Katherine takes Thomas to an abandoned mine where she saw Gabriel\'s car parked. Inside, they find angelic script on the walls and they experience a vision of a battlefield strewn with dead angels. Thomas and Katherine rush back to Mary\'s home. Gabriel and Jerry are there, and Gabriel is attempting to extract the soul. Thomas kills Jerry , and Gabriel is rendered unconscious when Katherine blows up Mary\'s trailer home by shooting a propane cylinder with Thomas\' gun. "Mary" informs Thomas that angels aren\'t immortal on Earth; they can be killed by tearing out their heart. Thomas frantically calls for Gabriel\'s "corpse" to be cuffed and taken into custody, but Gabriel easily escapes. Katherine, meanwhile, takes Thomas and Mary to a Native American site where a ritual is to be performed to expel Hawthorne\'s soul from Mary. Gabriel recruits another "assistant", Rachael , from the terminal unit of the ICU at a nearby hospital and threatens her with an eternity of living death unless she takes him to the site. That night, as Mary starts to undergo her exorcism, Katherine is confronted by Lucifer  himself. Lucifer tells Katherine that "other angels" have taken up this war against mankind, and since then, no human souls have been able to "meet their maker". He knows of Gabriel\'s plot to use Hawthorne\'s soul to overthrow the agents of Heaven, and he knows that if Gabriel wins, his "new" Heaven will ultimately devolve into another Hell, resulting in unwanted competition. The next day, Lucifer appears to Thomas and laments to him about the true nature of Hell &mdash; the absence of the divine presence &mdash; and then advises him to use Gabriel\'s lack of faith as a weapon against him. When Gabriel arrives, Thomas accuses him of being jealous of humanity, and asks him why he doesn\'t simply take his case to God; Gabriel mournfully reveals that God no longer speaks to him. The angel attempts to disrupt the ritual, but is stopped by Thomas, who kills Rachael and then runs over Gabriel with a truck, then beats him into submission with a tire iron. As the ritual continues, Lucifer appears and confronts Gabriel. He tells him the war is based on arrogance, which is evil &mdash; making it Lucifer\'s territory, not Gabriel\'s. Lucifer rips out a defiant Gabriel\'s heart and devours it. Once the tribal ancestors complete the exorcism. Hawthorne\'s soul is expelled from Mary and destroyed. With the threat eliminated, Lucifer asks Thomas and Katherine to "come home" with him, but they refuse. The film closes with Lucifer returning to Hell, and Thomas commenting on the nature of faith and what it means to truly be human.'] ["A Russian peasant family is eating dinner when a truck stops in the front yard. The father opens the door of the truck to find a murdered woman and two crying infants in the seat next to her. Forty years later Marie Jones has been summoned to Russia by a notary who claims to have found her long dead parents and the home they owned. As she climbs the steps to his office someone brushes past her. Marie arrives at the house where her mother died and is confronted by an old woman who insists that she should not go to the Kardinovsky farm, where Marie's parents lived. They are interrupted by Anitoly, Marie's guide, the only person willing to venture to the farm at night. The farm sits on an island and is only accessible by a bridge. Marie and Anitoly cross the bridge and stop a few yards from the house. Anitoly tells Marie to stay in the truck while he makes sure there are no animals blocking their path. Marie waits, and then sees what appears to be Anitoly ahead of her, but when she leaves the truck she finds herself alone. Shortly afterwards the truck's engine dies. Marie enters the house with a flashlight and begins investigating. She hears a bang and a child wailing from upstairs, but finds nothing. Marie enters a nursery, and sees, out of the corner of her eye, a woman walking past. When she runs into the hallway she sees the same woman enter another room. Marie follows and comes face to face with her doppelgänger who appears to be soaking wet. She runs out the house in time to see the truck leave. In a panic she chases it and falls into the river where she begins drowning. Marie wakes up in a much warmer and brightly lit room in the house. She meets Nikolai who explains that he is her brother and that he was summoned by the notary. Marie is sceptical, but when he takes her upstairs and shows her their cribs she realises he is being truthful. She tells him what she saw and he explains that seeing your double shows you how you will die. They meet Nikolai's doppelgänger, a bloody, ravaged body, and realise they have to leave the island. As they are ready to flee Nikolai falls through a hole in the floor and vanishes. In her parents' room, Marie witnesses events from the past as she watches her father stab her mother to death on their bed. Screaming, she turns to find her doppelgänger behind her. This time it catches her in the babies' room and seems to suck out part of her soul, leaving her gasping and disoriented. Marie flees the house, taking a boat to the other side of the river as her doppelgänger watches. As Marie runs through the forest, she finds herself before the house again. When she enters, she finds the dining room clean, as it must have been decades earlier. At the table, looking morosely at a birthday cake, is an injured Nikolai. He did not die, but merely fell into the basement. He tells Marie that they were not meant to leave the house. They were supposed to die with their mother and now, on the eve of their birthday, the house has called them to fulfill their destinies at midnight. When the clock strikes midnight, the entire house returns to the state it was in 1966, and they hear their father enter the house. Marie tries to intercept him, hoping to change the past, but Nikolai tells her that it has already happened; the only way to survive would be to escape in the past, where the house cannot touch them. When they try they are separated, and Marie ends up in the back of the truck as her father drives away with the infants, while Nikolai sees the form of his long lost love, Natalie. Marie's father stops at the barn, leaving one baby in a pig's pen for the boars, while he tries to drown the other in the boars' water tank. Marie's injured mother shoots her father in the head and grabs both babies, fleeing to the truck. Nikolai turns to see his lover is now his father and is attacked by the boars. Marie finds her father's now desiccated body in the barn, and is then pushed into a pseudo-past where she realises her father and the notary are the same person. She flees his office in the present and runs into her past self as she comes up the steps, and continues fleeing into the sunlight until she finds herself back in the house, this time between the past and the present, where the apparition of her father explains that he has always loved his children and his wife, and could not let them leave him. She runs from him and finds Nikolai's body being eaten by the boars. When her doppelgänger comes after her, Marie flees to the truck parked outside and drives away. Marie's father's voice comes over the radio, telling her to return and join the family he has created. The bridge that brought her there has been destroyed, and she plunges into the lake, drowning. The film ends with Marie's daughter, Emily, explaining that she knew her mother would never return. It has been months since she left for Russia and she has never had the desire to know what happened to her or her parents, breaking the cycle and leaving her abandoned."] ['{{Plot}} On March 17, 994., The Leprechaun is a thousand years old. Since that is his birthday, he can choose any woman to be his bride. He picks a young girl of the O\'Day family. The Leprechaun describes the girl he has chosen to O\'Day, but when O\'Day sees that the girl is in fact his daughter, he intervenes with "God bless you, my child" therefore denying the Leprechaun his bride, as the creature can marry any girl who sneezes three times, provided no one says "God bless you." The Leprechaun captures, tortures and tells O\'Day that he will marry his descendant in a thousand years time on St Patrick\'s Day, before he kills O\'Day, whose corpse is then discovered by his daughter. In present day Los Angeles, the Leprechaun has found a petulant sixteen-year-old girl named Bridget Callum, a descendant of the O\'Day bloodline, who is fighting with her boyfriend, Cody Ingalls. Cody, whose legal guardian is his uncle, Morty, frequently has to break their dates in order to support Morty, an alcoholic scam artist. The Leprechaun steals some whiskey and a gold tooth from a homeless man and a gold ring off the finger of Tim Street, a talent agent, who believes that the little man is some kind of performer. After all of this, he follows Bridget to her house, where a boy named Ian attempts to persuade her into letting him in; she refuses with a swift elbow to his ribs. The Leprechaun then creates an illusion that fools Ian into believing that Bridget is asking him to kiss her breasts, while in actuality, they are a pair of lawnmower blades that start up after Ian shoves his face into them. Shortly afterwards, Cody knocks on the door and apologizes, offering flowers, which causes Bridget to sneeze all over his shirt. The third time she sneezes, Cody begins to say "God bless you," but is unable to complete the blessing when the Leprechaun attempts to strangle him with a telephone cord. After a struggle, the Leprechaun grabs Bridget and disappears, losing one of his gold coins, which Cody soon finds. The police soon arrive, find Bridget missing, Ian badly injured, and a note from Cody at the scene, leading them to get an arrest warrant out for him. Cody returns to Morty\'s house and tells him what happened; Morty is convinced that he is crazy until the Leprechaun breaks into the house and they barely escape. Morty and Cody then go to a bar, which is filled with little people dressed as leprechauns, celebrating St. Patrick\'s Day. While there, Cody is given a piece of chocolate in a gold wrapper by one of the bar\'s patrons ([[Tony Cox . The Leprechaun appears and Morty challenges him to a drinking contest in honor of his wedding. While the Leprechaun downs whiskey, Morty is actually drinking soda and water. The Leprechaun eventually becomes extremely drunk, so much to the point he can barely speak properly or use his magic. He distracts Morty and Cody by turning on a jukebox with his powers, leading him to bash Morty in the head with a bottle to get away. He goes to a coffee shop, where he sobers up, and takes the time to murder a waiter ([[Michael McDonald  who was making jokes about his size and speech. Upon being asked for payment for the coffee, the leprechaun thinks the waiter wants to take his gold and kills him. Meanwhile, Cody and Morty break into the go-kart racetrack that Ian worked at since the office contains a huge safe on wheels made of wrought iron, the only thing that can harm the Leprechaun. Cody traps the Leprechaun inside, but Morty takes advantage of the opportunity to claim three wishes and locks Cody in a store room. His first is for the Leprechaun\'s pot of gold, which the creature causes to appear in Morty\'s stomach, grotesquely stretching it. Morty wishes for the Leprechaun out of the safe so that he can help him, and, for his third wish, asks for the pot of gold out of him. The Leprechaun cuts Morty\'s stomach open and pulls out the pot, killing Morty. Morty begs for help as he dies, but the Leprechaun laughingly says "love to, friend, but you\'re all out of wishes." Just then, as Cody breaks out of the store room, a security guard, who has responded to a silent alarm that Morty tripped, enters. The Leprechaun disappears, setting Cody up to take the fall for the brutal murder. Before he can arrest Cody, however, the officer is lured onto the track by the Leprechaun\'s impersonation of Bridget and is run over twice and killed by the little green man in his own custom go-kart. He attempts to kill Cody for his gold coin, but Cody realizes that as long as he holds it, the Leprechaun cannot harm him, leading him to run to the Leprechaun\'s lair to attempt rescuing Bridget. Before he can find Bridget, however, Cody is attacked by the skeleton of Willam O\' Day carrying out the Leprechaun\'s bidding. When he manages to fell the skeleton, he is encased in a tangle of tree roots. When the tree roots turn out to be an illusion, he finally stumbles upon Bridget in the Leprechaun\'s room with a gold collar on her neck. Suddenly, the Leprechaun corners Cody, demanding that he return his coin. Bridget, who has been picking at her collar with a broken awl, breaks off the collar, throws it at the Leprechaun\'s head, and runs. Cody follows. The Leprechaun dusts off his hat and pursues them both . Wherever Cody and Bridget run, they end up back in the same place. In their mad dash to find an exit, Bridget and Cody get separated. When they meet up again, Bridget convinces Cody to leave the coin behind on the supposition that the Leprechaun will stop chasing them if they give him what he wants. When Cody is reluctant to part with the coin, the only thing that is keeping the Leprechaun from harming them, Bridget turns on the charm and kisses him, so Cody hands her the coin. Bridget backs away and starts to laugh saying "You Lose!" in the Leprechaun\'s voice. The Leprechaun knocks Cody across the room and then goes after Bridget, intending to lead her to their wedding bed. Suddenly, Cody jumps up and shoves an iron crowbar through the Leprechaun\'s chest. As the Leprechaun begins to sizzle, Cody points out that the gold coin he gave him was actually the gold-covered milk chocolate that a St. Paddy\'s Day reveler had given him earlier. Together, Cody and Bridget run out of the lair, and the Leprechaun explodes behind him. In the final scene, Bridget asks Cody how he knew that the illusionary Bridget wasn\'t really her kissing him, and Cody informs her that her kisses are different. She then asks him whether he\'s going to keep the coin. "It\'s not worth it," Cody replies and tosses it on the ground.'] ['An American ballet student, Suzy Banyon , arrives from her flight in Munich, Germany on a stormy night to enroll in a prestigious dance academy in Freiburg.

Later that night, Suzy awakens to discover that she has been moved into a dormitory room against her wishes. The doctors then tell Suzy that she is to be "medicated" with a glass of wine daily. Suzy befriends Sarah after the two are roomed together. As Suzy and the rest of the students prepare for dinner, hundreds of maggots fall from the ceiling. The students are told this was due to spoiled food boxed in the attic. The girls are then invited to sleep in the practice hall overnight. During the night, Sarah identifies a distinctive whistling snore as that of the school\'s director, who is not due to return to the academy for several weeks. The next morning, Tanner orders Daniel to leave the academy immediately after his guide dog bites Albert. Later that night, Sarah overhears the teacher\'s footsteps and begins to count them whilst Suzy becomes irresistibly drowsy and falls asleep. Meanwhile, while Daniel and his guide dog cross a plaza within the city, Daniel senses a strange presence. Suddenly, his seemingly calm dog lunges at Daniel and tears his throat out, killing him.

The two girls search for Pat\'s notes in Sarah\'s room, but they appear to have been stolen. Suzy suddenly becomes drowsy and falls asleep before Sarah flees to the attic after hearing approaching footsteps. Sarah is chased by an unseen pursuer and, thinking she will be able to escape through a window into another room, falls into a huge pile of barbed wire. Becoming entangled, she struggles in anguish until a mysterious black-gloved hand of a dark figure appears and slits her throat. The following morning, Blanc and Tanner inform Suzy that Sarah has abruptly left the academy. Confused and suspicious, Suzy goes to meet one of Sarah\'s acquaintances, a psychologist named Dr. Mandel , who explains that the academy was founded by Helena Markos, a cruel Greek émigré who was widely believed to be a witch. Dr. Mandel\'s colleague, Professor Millus, then tells Suzy that a coven can only survive with their queen. Upon Suzy\'s return to the academy that night, she discovers that all of the students have gone to the theater. She overhears the footsteps Sarah identified before and follows them to Blanc\'s office. She suddenly recalls Pat\'s mumbling after discovering irises painted all over the walls of Blanc\'s office.

Frightened, Suzy then sneaks into another room, where she accidentally awakens a shadowy figure who reveals herself as Helena Markos. Helena then orders Sarah\'s nearby corpse to rise from the dead to murder Suzy. Suzy then stabs Helena with one of the room\'s decorative knives, which appears to kill her  and Sarah\'s reanimated corpse. Helena\'s demise causes the building to set alight. As the academy is slowly destroyed with the coven inside, Suzy manages to escape before the entire building catches on fire.'] ['The movie begins with the murder of a farmer by an elderly insane woman with terribly burned facial features. After stabbing the farmer and accidentally setting his barn on fire, the woman stumbles home to her family. The family, an older couple and a young teenage woman, argue about the best way to handle the situation and make vague references that the elderly woman may have killed people in the past. The scene then switches to the main character, a young man named Jodie who is on an open-ended car trip across America to find himself and discover whether or not he wishes to follow in his father\'s footsteps as a lawyer. Jodie stops at a small pond to have lunch and meets Melissa, the teenage girl from the previous scene. They banter briefly and she convinces him to come visit her family on their walnut farm, despite the intense distress this offer causes her parents. The young couple grows increasingly close, despite the frightening presence of the elderly woman and various clues dropped along the way that Melissa is, in fact, a 127-year-old witch and the birth sister of the elderly insane woman. When the old woman murders a deputy policeman in front of Jodie, Melissa confesses that she is a cursed witch and is possessed by Satan. Jodie refuses to believe this, so Melissa reveals in a dream-sequence that her sister was burned as a witch by an angry mob of villagers in the 19th century. Melissa was so distressed by the sight of her sister being burned at the stake that she offered her soul to Satan in order to gain the power to save her. Satan agreed and allowed Melissa to save her sister. Melissa was given eternal life and youth as a result of this bargain, but the gift was a curse as she watched her now-insane sister grow old and homicidal. The old woman tries to kill Jodie, but Melissa uses her powers to stop her and her sister dies in a fire that she started. Jodie eventually believes Melissa and has sex with her, effectively "freeing" her from Satan. Unexpectedly, however, she instantly ages to her "actual" age and Jodie must sell his soul to Satan in order to restore Melissa\'s youth and save her life. The movie ends with the realization that each are bound to Satan and that Melissa\'s attempt to save herself has only managed to draw Jodie into the evil contract as well.'] ['{{Plot}} In a Las Vegas pawn shop, a decrepit old man with one leg and hand shows up and pawns the shop owner Gupta with a statue wearing a medallion around its neck. The old man claims the statue is his good luck charm and warns Gupta to never touch the medallion it\'s wearing. Gupta cannot resist taking the medallion, so he removes it from the statue. Then a Leprechaun  suddenly springs to life from his statue prison, jumps on Gupta\'s back, and bites off a part of his ear, accusing him of being a greedy thief. Before he can cause him anymore harm, Gupta reveals that he is wearing a medallion that he found on the Leprechaun\'s then petrified body. The Leprechaun grabs his pot of gold and runs from it and hides in the basement, where Gupta traps him inside. The Leprachaun notices one gold coin is missing. Gupta then attempts to negotiate with the Leprechaun by allowing him to have half of the gold in exchange for the Leprechaun\'s freedom. Knowing he is being tricked, Leprechaun tosses the medallion aside. Gupta runs back upstairs to call for help, but is strangled to death by the Leprechaun via the phone cord. Meanwhile, college student Scott McCoy has just arrived in Las Vegas, but while driving on the streets, he notices a woman with car trouble. He stops and gives her a ride to the Lucky Shamrock Casino, where she works. Introduced as Tammy, Scott becomes immediately infatuated with her. While at the casino, Scott can\'t resist gambling, so he plays at the tables. He loses all of his money at the roulette wheel, so he goes to the local shop to pawn his watch, where he uncovers Gupta\'s lifeless body on the floor. While calling for police, Scott unknowingly finds and takes Leprechaun’s coin and is given one wish. The computer on the counter next to him states in folklore that one wish grants the mortal anything he or she desires and that it remains permanent if kept in possession by that mortal. After hearing this, Scott sarcastically wishes that he had a winning streak. After he leaves the shop , Scott strikes rich at the casino . He is later robbed by Loretta and Fazio, casino employees and then attacked by the Leprechaun. He is able to throw Leprechaun out of the hotel window, but in the process is bitten and some of Leprechaun\'s blood mixes with his. During his stay at the casino, Scott begins to undergo Leprechaun-like tendencies . In the meantime, Loretta and Fazio, along with the Lucky Shamrock\'s owner Mitch pass the coin around making wishes. Mitch wishes he could sleep with Tammy, Loretta wishes for a new body, and Fazio wishes that he were the greatest magician in the world. Leprechaun has survived the fall and one by one, he kills them off. When Mitch goes up to have sex with Tammy, Loretta steals the coin, and when it leaves the vicinity of the room, Tammy snaps out of the coin\'s spell. After she leaves the room, the Leprchaun enters, using magic to turn the television on. There is a very sexy woman who looks just like Tammy on the television and starts speaking Mitch\'s name. She comes out of the television and starts kissing Mitch. Mitch hears the Leprechaun on the television and looks up. When he looks back at the woman, she is actually a robot, which proceeds to electrocute him. Scott and Tammy spot the Leprechaun beside Mitch\'s body asking for the coin to be given back to him. Scott and Tammy subdue the Leprechaun and flee Mitch\'s room. Two casino workers walk in but are quickly killed by the Leprechaun. Outside the casino, Scott has begun to turn slowly into a Leprechaun himself from being bitten and must fight his urges. When Tammy takes him to the nearest hospital, Scott is promptly taken to the examination room. The doctors notice irregularity in both his skin and blood, due to Scott\'s transformation. Scott, now a tall Leprechaun, stands up from his stretcher, subdues the medical officials observing him, and starts wandering around the hospital sensing that his "brother" is somewhere in the building. Tammy, worried over Scott\'s condition, ventures into the empty hospital hallways to find him. Noticing a dead mortician, the Leprechaun captures her at the morgue and threatens to kill her if she doesn\'t tell him where Scott is. Before he can cause fatal harm to Tammy, Scott immediately appears and a showdown commences between the two. As they each use magic to subdue one another, Leprechaun warns Scott that his Leprechaun-like tendencies cannot be fought so easily and that he would eventually be drawn to the gold\'s power. Scott then informs him that Fazio is the one who has the coin, so Leprechaun strolls away in the stretcher and flips him off. Meanwhile, back in the casino, Loretta wishes for her 20-year-old body back. When confronted by the Leprechaun she tells him she doesn\'t have the coin anymore, the Leprechaun inflates her lips, chest, and buttocks. The inflated Loretta tries to escape via an open door but becomes stuck when she tried to squeeze her newly inflated buttocks through. She continues to grow larger before finally exploding. Shortly after, Fazio wished to be the best magician in the world. During his magic performance, however, Leprechaun shows up, and attempts to saw him in half. Leprechaun possessed an actual chainsaw at the time, and Fazio knew that Leprechaun was going to kill him. Fazio attempts to make another wish on the coin that he would be at Caesar\'s Palace, but to no avail since the Leprechaun informs him that he already made one wish and that it\'s pointless because he only gets one wish. Everyone in the crowd starts insisting they want the saw trick to be done, not knowing that there would be that much blood and gore. The whole crowd, in disgust, sees Fazio being killed on stage, they all screamed in fear. Tammy and Scott arrive and warn the people to leave for their own safety. The audience immediately leave, while Scott continues to battle with the Leprechaun. Still in Leprechaun form, Scott can\'t resist the pot of gold the Leprechaun leaves on the stage floor. Leprechaun promises Scott that if he takes the pot of gold, they\'ll share it, and Scott will be trapped forever as a Leprechaun. After hearing Tammy\'s pleas to not take it and that the Leprechaun\'s powers lie in his gold, Scott burns the gold, which in turn incinerates him. Scott morphs back to his regular self, and he and Tammy share a kiss and happily leave the casino together.'] ["In Ancient Egypt, there once reigned the malevolent Queen Aneh-Tet , who ruled Egypt with an iron fist, terrorising the populace and slaughtering her enemies.

At Hogwarts, headmaster Albus Dumbledore introduces ex-Auror Alastor "Mad-Eye" Moody as the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. In their first Defence Against the Dark Arts lesson, the students learn of the three Unforgivable Curses. The Imperius Curse causes absence of free will, the Cruciatus Curse causes unbearable pain, and the final curse, Avada Kedavra, causes death. Dumbledore announces that the school will host the Triwizard Tournament, in which one wizard from each of the three magical schools competes in three challenges. The champions are selected by the Goblet of Fire, a magical cup into which the candidates\' names are placed. Fred and George attempt to enter using an aging potion as no one under 17 can enter. This fails miserably. Cedric Diggory, a student from the House of Hufflepuff, is chosen to represent Hogwarts, Viktor Krum is chosen to represent Durmstrang Institute, and Fleur Delacour is selected to represent Beauxbatons Academy of Magic. The Goblet unexpectedly chooses a fourth champion: Harry. As Harry is underage and should have been ineligible to compete, Hogwarts teachers and students grow suspicious, and the feat drives Ron and Harry apart. The teachers want Dumbledore to pull Harry out of the tournament, but the four champions are bound by a magical contract and therefore Dumbledore has no choice and Harry must compete. For the first task of the Triwizard Tournament, each of the champions must retrieve a golden egg guarded by a dragon. Mad-Eye advises Harry to use his talent for flying to overcome the dragon. Harry enters the first task and summons his broomstick to retrieve the egg, which contains information about the second challenge. The students are soon informed of the Yule Ball, a Christmas Eve ball held during the Triwizard Tournament. Ron and Harry have trouble finding dates to the ball and when they find out that Hermione is attending with Viktor Krum, Ron becomes jealous. In exchange for previous aid, Cedric provides Harry with a clue that prompts him to open the egg underwater. With help from Moaning Myrtle, he learns that the second task entails the retrieval of "something precious" to each of the competitors from the nearby Black Lake, where there are mermaids. While preparing for the task, Neville Longbottom provides Harry with Gillyweed, enabling him to breathe underwater for one hour. Harry is the first to arrive at the location, and finds Ron, Hermione, Cho Chang and Fleur\'s sister, Gabrielle, in suspended animation. Finishing last after attempting to free Ron and Gabrielle, Harry is awarded second place for "outstanding moral fiber", behind Cedric. Following an exchange with Mad-Eye, Ministry official Barty Crouch, Sr. is found dead by Harry shortly after the second task. While waiting in Dumbledore\'s office, Harry\'s curiosity leads him to look into Dumbledore\'s pensieve, causing him to revisit one of Dumbledore\'s memories. He witnesses a trial before the Wizengamot in which captured Death Eater Igor Karkaroff, the current headmaster of Durmstrang, denounces a number of Death Eaters, including both Severus Snape and Barty Crouch Jr. While Dumbledore vouches for Snape\'s integrity, Crouch Sr. is horrified at this revelation and disowns his maniacal son, sending him to Azkaban. Upon returning to the present time, Dumbledore tells Harry that he is searching his memories for a clue as to why extraordinary events have taken place at Hogwarts since the start of the tournament. In the Triwizard Tournament\'s third and final task, the competitors are placed inside a hedge maze; their challenge is to reach the Triwizard Cup. Krum, acting under the Imperius curse, incapacitates Fleur and attempts to do the same to Cedric. Harry stops Cedric from attacking Krum, and the two run for the cup. When Cedric is trapped by vines, Harry frees him and the two claim a draw and grab hold of the cup together. The cup, which is a Portkey, transports the two champions to a graveyard where Wormtail and Voldemort are waiting for Harry. Wormtail murders Cedric, traps Harry, then performs a ritual that rejuvenates Voldemort, who then summons the Death Eaters  and bids them to witness a duel between their Dark Lord and his nemesis. As Harry, who is tortured by Voldemort, fights him, a connection called Priori Incantatem occurs between their wands. Harry\'s wand forces Voldemort\'s to disgorge the spirits of the people Voldemort has most recently murdered, including Harry\'s parents, Frank Bryce and Cedric. Harry is briefly protected by the spirits and escapes with Cedric\'s body  using the cup. Upon his return, Harry tells Dumbledore and Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge that Voldemort has returned and is responsible for Cedric\'s death. Mad-Eye leads a devastated Harry back to the castle, where his questions make Harry suspicious. Mad-Eye reveals it was he who put Harry\'s name in the Goblet, assisted Cedric and Neville in helping Harry, cursed Krum and so on. Dumbledore, Snape and McGonagall arrive and force Veritaserum, a truth-telling potion down Mad-Eye\'s throat. He reveals he is not Alastor "Mad-Eye" Moody and the real one is imprisoned in a magical trunk minus his magical eye and fake leg. The false Mad-Eye\'s Polyjuice Potion  wears off and he is revealed as Barty Crouch Jr., who shows a pulsing Dark Mark tattoo on his forearm meaning Voldemort\'s returned. Soon after, students and staff of Hogwarts, Durmstrang and Beauxbatons gather in the Great Hall to say farewell to Cedric. Dumbledore exhorts them to stand together against Voldemort, as the representatives from Durmstrang and Beauxbatons leave Hogwarts.'] ['David Niven plays the owner of a vineyard, who is called back to the estate when it falls on hard times.

As time passes it becomes clear that a blood sacrifice is expected to return the vineyard to its former glory.'] ['The film begins showing people using a ouija board in Morocco. Throughout the scene, something is seen from first person perspective coming at high speed towards the people. The main film begins with four housemates  deciding to go out and party. Also going to the party is Lucy , Webster, Joe  and Annie . As the night progresses, they all try to find the biggest buzz they can, until Spencer suggests a ouija board, saying it is the weirdest buzz he\'s ever had. The partygoers agree and participate, all placing their right index fingers on an upside-down glass with the alphabet and the words \'Yes\' and \'No\' written in a circle around the glass. Lucy tells them that under no circumstances should they remove their fingers from the glass early – otherwise the spirit they summon will not be able to return. At first, the glass moves slowly, spelling out \'DJINN\', but when Liam asks if it can predict the future, the glass sharply goes to \'Yes\'. It then proceeds to spell out \'ALL DIE\' and then Annie\'s name. Before the ritual can continue, however, Liam experiences visions similar to the prologue that causes him to run away. Annie goes to see him to check if he\'s alright, but Liam refuses to talk. Annie realises she has left her inhaler in the room that they used the ouija board in, and goes back to get it. When she gets there, she becomes frightened by noises. Eventually she sees something that the camera does not see, and it gives chase . Finding Liam nowhere and with her exits barred, she attempts to climb over a glass roof to safety, but the thing giving chase grabs her legs and she falls through the glass roof into the party below, dying instantly. As the camera pans out, severe burn marks are seen on her legs. The group are distraught by her death, but while Spencer goes to find some hash to calm himself down, Lucy goes back to her boat and does some research. She comes across a description of a djinn, explaining that it\'s made of fire. She learns that it can be banished by using lawful magic. She is suddenly disturbed by banging all around her, but it turns out to be a boatman who is telling her that the electrics are down. Lucy and Spencer go to the house where everyone else lives and discuss the events of the night. Lucy suggests to the housemates that they may have summoned a djinn, saying the burns on Annie are signs of this being true. The housemates are still skeptical, so they watch the tape they recorded of the \'summoning\' to check if anyone was pushing it. Soon after Liam freaks out in the video, however, the electricity in the house goes out. Webster and Spencer break into the landlord\'s flat  and find a hidden shrine of sorts to the Djinn with grisly photos and newspaper cuttings. It is also revealed that Liam\'s father, Paul Brennan, had been in the same predicament once  and killed his mother as a result. He pled insanity and was put in a mental hospital. Joe attempts to get information out of Liam about it the next day at college, but he gets angry and leaves. Stella also leaves soon after, and goes to the toilet where she is brutally murdered . Her body is discovered by a nearby student. Liam goes to see his father to get answers but it quickly descends into a row. When Liam mentions Becker his father shouts that he is there to protect Liam. Liam leaves without hearing this. Meanwhile, Joe and Webster sneak back into the house  to get the camera which recorded the ritual and Webster insists on watching it there. Joe goes to the kitchen to get a light for his cigarette. Meanwhile Webster is thrown into a panic by something on the film. He goes to look for Joe. In the hallway he turns the lights on and realises he is standing in a pool of blood. He runs for the front door which is locked, so he rushes back upstairs to get the keys. He has to hide under the bed as he is being chased by the djinn. While the djinn does not see him, it dumps Joe\'s dead body in the room - his throat has been slit. Webster silently exits the room with keys in hand but steps on a broken light bulb, alerting the djinn. He races back down to open the door, but the djinn catches up and kills him before he can succeed. Rob and Spencer return to Lucy\'s boat and tell her of Stella\'s death. Lucy demands that they perform the banishing ritual, so they return to the warehouse where the party was held. Liam attempts to catch up with them, but upon arriving at their boat, they have already left. Lucy, Spencer and Rob begin the ritual, but as they are performing it, a sudden burst of flame from the ouija board frightens them all off. Spencer runs off and tries to look around, but when he drops a large metal pole he alerts the djinn, who has already arrived, to his location. He hides in a cupboard. We then learn that the djinn has possessed Rob. The djinn walks off, making Spencer think he is safe, until he bursts into the cupboard from behind and kills Spencer. Liam enters the building, as does Mr. Becker, who is holding a petrol can. As Liam walks into the ritual room, Rob runs out, shouting "Liam, it\'s Becker, he\'s here!" but is interrupted by Becker who hits him with a bat and proceeds to douse him with petrol. Liam, thinking Becker is the djinn, runs in to save Rob, accidentally pushing Becker down some stairs. When he goes back to look Becker has disappeared. Later Becker reappears and Liam is about to kill him in revenge for Annie until Rob rushes in and stops him. Seconds later, Rob kills Becker in a panic when Becker attempts to choke him. They start to leave, Rob attempting to convince Liam there really was no djinn but Liam remembers Lucy and they go looking for her. Liam finds her hanged in the lift shaft. Rob reveals to Liam that he is the djinn, telling Liam that it\'s his turn as his father sent him somewhere terrible, so now Liam will know the pain that he has.

Six years later, the film introduces Liz Reynolds , a young woman with a psychic bond to Mike Pearson and the Tall Man that manifests in the form of prophetic nightmares. After she awakens from one, she looks at her dream journal, which includes drawings detailing characters and events from the first film; during this, she recalls a vision that picks up immediately where the first film ended: after the Tall Man\'s minions attacked Mike through his bedroom mirror, Reggie heard the commotion and ran upstairs to his aid. He tried to get a shotgun, but was attacked by Lurkers and had to flee, although he managed to surreptitiously snuff the pilot lights on the stove. Once upstairs, he dodged the Tall Man and rescued Mike, and the two dove out of the bedroom window to escape as the gas fumes reached the living room fireplace and destroyed the house. Following this, Liz pleads for Mike to find her, as she fears that when her grandfather dies, the Tall Man will take him. Having been institutionalized as delusional since the first film, Mike feels he can no longer ignore Liz\'s dream pleas, and fakes his recovery to obtain a doctor\'s release. At night, he returns to Morningside Cemetery to exhume bodies and is interrupted by Reggie who tells him that the attack at the beginning of the film never occurred. Mike reveals that the coffins he dug up are empty and urges Reggie to help him hunt the Tall Man down. En route to Reggie\'s house, Mike receives a vision of an impending gas explosion, and frantically tries to warn Reggie seconds before his house is consumed in an explosion, killing his wife Celeste, daughter Bonnie, and Aunt Marta. Mike\'s futile warning convinces Reggie that he is telling the truth and agrees to accompany Mike on his quest. They break into a hardware store at night and stock up on an abundance of supplies and tools to build weapons. They then travel the country roads, encountering abandoned towns and pillaged graveyards, as well as a few traps and apparitions the Tall Man has left. One of them is an apparition of a fully nude deceased young woman. The clues lead them to Perigord, Oregon. Meanwhile, Liz\'s grandfather has died and she accompanies her grandmother to the funeral with her sister Jeri, who leaves prematurely and mysteriously vanishes. While searching for her, Liz explores the mortuary and discovers an exhumed coffin, but before she can open it, the Tall Man surprises her and she runs away. The presiding priest Father Meyers  maddened with fear and alcohol withdrawal, desecrates the grandfather\'s body with a knife in a desperate attempt to thwart the mysterious occurrences he has witnessed. That evening, during a bout of drinking, the reanimated grandfather surprises him at his door and then spirits into the grandmother\'s bed before absconding with her. In the morning, Liz finds the empty bed and a funeral pin; the Tall Man psychically tells her to return at night if she wants to rescue her grandmother. Prior to their arrival in Perigord, Mike awakens to find that Reggie has picked up a hitchhiker named Alchemy  who eerily resembles the nude apparition. They find Perigord deserted and decrepit, and stop in an abandoned bed & breakfast before venturing out to the cemetery. Liz arrives at the mortuary to search for her grandmother, but is confronted by Father Meyers, who tries to rally her to escape with him but he is killed by a flying sphere. She encounters the Tall Man and discovers that her grandmother is now one of his Lurkers. As she escapes, she and Mike meet in the cemetery and return to the bed & breakfast, where they try to sleep. When a tripped alarm distracts them downstairs, the Tall Man captures Liz, knocks her unconscious and drives her away in his hearse. Mike and Reggie chase him in Mike\'s deceased brother Jody\'s car, but the Tall Man runs them off the road and the car explodes. At the crematorium, Liz slowly regains consciousness while being taken into the furnace room by the Tall Man\'s mortician assistants. She fakes unconsciousness by allowing the assistant to partially undress her and take her crucifix. She manages to fight off the mortician by sending him into an active furnace and escapes. Mike and Reggie break into the mortuary and venture into the embalming room. As Reggie pours hydrochloric acid into a tank of embalming fluid, Mike discovers that the Tall Man, having learned from his mistakes, has hidden his transdimensional portal  behind a heavy steel door. In lieu of a handle, there is a large round "keyhole" in the wall and Mike realizes that they must capture a sphere in order to access the room. They then split up to find Liz. Reggie searches the basement where he is attacked by a Graver, then four Lurkers; after a vicious fight, Reggie kills the giant Graver by cutting off his penis with a chainsaw and guns down the Lurkers. Mike saves Liz from a silver sphere but they are both attacked by the other mortician, who is defeated when the silver sphere pins his hand to a door and cuts off the hand in an attempt to escape another sphere. A golden sphere pursues Mike and Liz but instead kills the second mortician as he tries to catch them. Reuniting with Reggie, the three pry the mortician\'s severed hand off the door and carry the embedded silver sphere to the embalming room, where they insert it into the "keyhole" and open the metal door to the white room containing the portal. Reggie ignites the flamethrower to burn the building down, but the Tall Man surprises them, knocking Reggie down, throwing Mike into the portal, and carrying Liz to the embalming table. Reggie helps Mike climb back out, while the Tall Man prepares to embalm Liz alive with a giant probe; Mike pulls the silver sphere from the keyhole and attacks the Tall Man with it unsuccessfully. Liz gets free and stabs the Tall Man with the probe, and Reggie quickly activates the embalming machine, pumping the acid-contaminated fluid into him, causing him to melt. Reggie sets fire to the room and hallways and the trio are greeted at the back entrance by Alchemy, who has procured an abandoned hearse. They ride off with Mike and Liz in the rear compartment and Reggie and Alchemy in the driver\'s cabin. Reggie thanks Alchemy for coming back for them and tries to flirt with her until she gently plucks a section of hair and flesh from her head, revealing that she is not human. As Reggie screams, the hearse swerves wildly and Mike and Liz try to get out; the hearse stops and a bloody and battered Reggie hits the window before falling to the ground. As the hearse begins to drive away, Mike and Liz tell each other "this is just a dream" but the slot to the driver\'s cabin opens, revealing the Tall Man who tells them "No, it\'s not." Hands break the rear window and pull Mike and Liz through it, mirroring the ending of the first film.'] ['In a 1910 prologue, an unnamed missionary  was kidnapped by native Bokor  to be sacrificed under a full moon. The Bokor tied her between two posts, whipped her, then carried her to a stone altar where they decapitated her. The ceremony was interrupted, however, by soldiers who shot all the participants. Unnoticed in the melee, a Shedim  took possession of the woman. Years later, Professor Jonathan Grant  commanded a safari investigating the disappearance of elephants in West Africa. Amongst the explorers were a "great white hunter," Rod Carter , two blonde women , and a mulatto woman, Tunika . Elizabeth\'s father financed the expedition. They stumbled across the clearing where the natives had performed their Vodoun rituals, before being wiped out in colonial times. Carol decided to take some photographs of the altar for a magazine article. They decided to camp nearby. That night, Carol returned to the clearing to take some more atmospheric photographs. The former missionary, now dressed in leopard skins and with feline-like canine teeth/fangs, emerged from the surrounding jungle and subdued her. The long-dead Bokors, resurrected from their burial mounds, recreated the ceremony from the prologue. Carol was whipped and decapitated. The remaining Europeans searched for Carol the next day, but discovered only her camera. That night, Carol, now also dressed in leopard skins, joins the other leopard-woman. Together, they crept into the camp. The brunette killed Professor Grant and destroyed the photographs from Carol\'s camera which he had been developing. The distraught Liz had taken sleeping pills when no one could locate her friend, and was groggy when Carol appeared in her tent. "Elizabeth, it\'s me, your best friend Carol." "We thought you\'d been lost in the jungle..." "It\'s just as well. Come!" The two blondes left the camp and joined the other leopard-woman in the jungle. "You will be initiated immediately, and death will be abolished eternally!" Just as Liz realized what they were going to do, the two leopard-women plunged their fangs into her neck. In Liz\'s struggles, the original leopard-woman was knocked down and the choker she wore to fasten her neck together split. Her severed head rolled free and she perished as blood gushed from her neck. After another fruitless day of searching, Rod and Tunika made plans to depart. That night Carol was joined by the demon-possessed Elizabeth, also dressed in leopard skins, her new fangs gleaming in the moonlight. They abducted Tunika, took her to the ceremonial clearing and placed her on the altar, and used their sharp fingernails and fangs to bloody her. As they placed the leopard skins across her shredded flesh, Rod emerged from the jungle and shot them both. He tossed his ammunition belts into the ceremonial fire, and the random shots killed the resurrected Bokor. In the confusion, he picked up Tunika and carried her to a jeep. They made their escape, and Tunika told him she was "feeling much better already" in the breathy voice of the Shedim.'] [' In 1990, architect Frank Bannister loses his wife, Debra, in a car accident. He gives up his profession, letting his unfinished "dream house" sit incomplete for years. Following the accident, Frank gains the power to see ghosts and befriends three: Cyrus, a 1970s gangster, Stuart, a 1950s nerd, and the Judge, a gunslinger from the Old West. The ghosts haunt houses in the area to accumulate work for Frank\'s ghostbusting business; Frank then "exorcises" the houses for a fee. He does this for an old woman, Mrs. Bradley, who keeps her daughter Patricia locked in the house. Most locals see him as a con man. Frank cons local health nut Ray Lynskey and his wife Lucy, a physician. Ray dies of a heart attack not long after. An encounter with his ghost leads Frank to discover that an entity resembling the Grim Reaper is killing people and marking numbers on their foreheads that only the psychic can see. Frank\'s wife Debra had a similar number when she was found. Because Frank can see the numbers ahead of time he can foretell the murders, but this puts him under suspicion with the police, even Sheriff Perry, who is usually patient with Frank. He calls in FBI agent Milton Dammers. Highly paranoid, obsessive and disturbed from years of undercover work, Dammers is convinced that Frank is psychically responsible for the killings. Frank is captured and detained after the town\'s newspaper editor, Madga, is killed: she\'d published articles attacking him. Lucy investigates the murders and becomes a target of the Reaper. She is attacked while visiting Frank in jail, but they escape with the help of Cyrus and Stuart, who are both dissolved in the process. Frank wants to commit suicide to stop the Reaper. Lucy helps Frank have a near death experience by putting him into hypothermia and using barbiturates to stop his heart. Dammers abducts Lucy, revealing that he had been a victim of Charles Manson and his "Family" in 1969. In his ghostly form, Frank confronts the Reaper and discovers that he is the ghost of Johnny Bartlett, a psychiatric hospital orderly who killed 12 people 32 years ago before being caught, convicted and executed. Patricia Bradley, then a teenager, was accused as his accomplice. Lucy resuscitates Frank and visits Patricia, who is actually on friendly terms with Bartlett\'s ghost. Lucy and Frank trap Bartlett\'s spirit in his urn, which Patricia has kept. The pair make for the chapel of the now-abandoned psychiatric hospital hoping to send Bartlett\'s ghost to Hell. Patricia and Dammers chase them through the ruins. Dammers throws the ashes away, releasing Bartlett\'s ghost again before Patricia kills him. Bartlett\'s ghost and Patricia hunt down Frank and Lucy. Frank realizes that Bartlett\'s ghost, with Patricia\'s help, was responsible for his wife\'s death and the number on her brow. Out of bullets, Patricia strangles Frank, but Frank in spirit form rips Patricia\'s spirit from her body. Bartlett grabs Patricia\'s ghost, while Frank makes it to Heaven, where he\'s reunited with Cyrus and Stuart along with his wife Debra. Bartlett and Patricia\'s spirits are dragged to Hell. Frank learns it is not yet his time and is sent back to his body. Frank and Lucy fall in love. Lucy can now see ghosts as well. Frank later begins demolishing the unfinished dream house and building a life with Lucy. As for the ghost of Dammers, he\'s now riding around in the sheriff\'s car.'] ['The story begins with the Howards, a young, married couple living in New York. Craig , an unpublished writer, and Samantha , a school teacher, are desperate to have a baby. Their hopes are dashed when Samantha is diagnosed as infertile and the couple can\'t afford the medical treatments that might allow her to conceive. Just when it seems their dreams are impossible, the couple are given the opportunity to receive free treatments from a new, and relatively unheard of, fertility clinic. The Spiritus Research Clinic is in Lakeview, a small town two hours away, and they move to the clinic. It soon becomes clear something is amiss. In the laboratory where the couple\'s eggs and sperm samples are being mixed, the scientist takes a large, engraved metal needle and injects a red substance into Craig\'s sperm without the couple\'s knowledge. After the treatments, they are overjoyed when it is discovered Samantha is pregnant with twins. Earlier in the film, Craig was introduced at a party to book publisher Earl Sidney. Suddenly the publisher wants to publish Craig\'s book and offers Craig $100,000 as an advance. The pregnant Samantha begins feeling unusually painful scratching from the unborn twins. She is also suspicious of her husband\'s new business associate and friend. She feels ignored and distanced from Craig. Meanwhile, a hooded stranger begins stalking Samantha. Samantha becomes friends with a priest, Father Carlo. It is he who tells Samantha she is the unknowing victim of a pact with evil. The book publisher and the scientists at the clinic are connected to "The New Light of Dawn" church, a secret devil-worshiping cult. The red liquid injected into the Howards\' test-tube pregnancy was the Devil\'s DNA. The cult plans to kidnap the babies shortly after birth and raise them to eventually destroy mankind. Father Carlo tells Samantha to drink a poison that will kill the babies, but she smashes the glass against his face. The crazed priest is also the hooded figure that has been following Samantha and sets the motel room he had taken her to on fire. He then gets in a car and drives away towards the clinic, with the intention to destroy it. He crashes through one operating room to another until crashing into Dr. Leeds\' office.

With preparations for the celebration underway, the centennial is also marked by a series of ominous events; as the witching hour strikes and the date of the town\'s centennial begins, various odd phenomena begin to happen all over the sleeping town - objects move by themselves, television sets turn themselves on, gas stations seemingly come to life, and all the public payphones ring simultaneously. That same night, Father Malone, the town\'s alcoholic priest, is in his study in the church when a large piece of stone falls from the wall revealing a cavity. Inside is an old journal, his grandfather\'s diary from a hundred years earlier. Father Malone removes the book from the wall and begins to read. The diary reveals that in 1880, six of the founders of Antonio Bay  deliberately sank and plundered a clipper ship named the Elizabeth Dane. The ship was owned by Blake, a wealthy man with leprosy who wanted to establish a colony near Antonio Bay. During a foggy night, the six conspirators lit a fire on the beach near treacherous rocks, and the crew of the ship, deceived by the false beacon, crashed into them. Everyone aboard the ship perished. The six conspirators were motivated both by greed and disgust at the notion of having a leper colony nearby. Antonio Bay and its church were then founded with the gold plundered from the ship. A supernaturally glowing fog appears, spreading over the sea and moving against the wind. Three local fishermen are out at sea getting drunk when the fog covers their trawler. When two of them go on deck to investigate, they see a ghostly looking clipper ship pulling alongside their trawler. The mysterious fog contains the vengeful ghosts of Blake and the clipper ship\'s crew, who have come back on the hundredth anniversary of the shipwreck and the founding of the town to take the lives of six people: symbolic substitutes for the six conspirators. Two of the fishermen are attacked and slaughtered on deck, while the third is killed in the wheelhouse. At the same time, town resident Nick Castle drives down a country road and picks up a young female hitchhiker named Elizabeth Solley. While the two drive towards town, the radio and headlights of Nick\'s truck start to fail and all the windows inexplicably shatter. The following morning, local radio DJ Stevie Wayne is given a piece of driftwood, part of a board, that was found on the beach by her young son Andy. The wood is inscribed with the word "DANE". Intrigued by the object, Stevie keeps it and takes it with her to the lighthouse where she broadcasts her radio show from. Stevie sets the board down on top of a tape player that is playing, and while she is momentarily distracted, the board inexplicably begins to seep water. The water spreads and causes the tape player to short out. Suddenly, a mysterious man\'s voice emerges from the tape player swearing revenge, and the words "6 Must Die" appear on the wood before it bursts into flames. A shocked Stevie quickly extinguishes the fire, but then she sees that the board once again reads "DANE" and the tape player begins working normally again. After locating the missing trawler, Nick and Elizabeth find the corpse of Dick Baxter with his eyes gouged out. The other two fishermen are nowhere to be found. The body is taken to the local coroner\'s office to be examined by Dr. Phibes, who is perplexed by the body\'s advanced state of decomposition considering Baxter died only hours earlier. Whilst Elizabeth is alone in the autopsy room with Baxter\'s corpse, the body becomes momentarily re-animated. It rises from the autopsy table and grabs Elizabeth. As Elizabeth screams, Nick and Phibes rush back into the autopsy room, where they see the corpse lifeless again on the floor. However, it appears to have scratched the number "3" into the floor with the scalpel. Baxter was the third victim to die. While this is happening, Kathy Williams, the wife of one of the missing fishermen and one of the driving forces behind the town\'s centennial, and her assistant Sandy Fadel visit Father Malone to ask him to give the benediction at that night\'s ceremony. He reads to them from the journal and reveals to them how the town was founded on murder and their celebration would be honoring murderers which is something the two women do not want to hear. That evening, the Antonio Bay centennial celebration begins in the center of town. Kathy is told by the sheriff and Nick about her husband\'s disappearance, but insists on going on with her part in the ceremonies. At the same time, Dan, the local weatherman, calls Stevie at the radio station to tell her that another fog bank has appeared and is moving towards town. As they are talking, the fog gathers outside the weather station and Dan hears a knock at the door. Leaving Stevie on the phone while he goes to answer it, Dan is killed by the ghosts as Stevie listens in horror. As Stevie continues her radio broadcast, the fog begins moving inland and neutralizes the town\'s phone and electricity lines. Using a back-up generator, Stevie begs her listeners to go to her house and save her son when she sees the fog closing in from her lighthouse vantage point. Nick and Elizabeth hear this on the car radio and go to help. Meanwhile, at Stevie\'s home, her son\'s babysitter, Mrs. Kobritz, is killed by the ghosts as the fog envelops the house. The ghosts then pursue Andy, but Nick arrives just in time to save him and they escape. As the town\'s celebration comes to an end, Kathy and Sandy are driving home when they turn on the car radio and hear Stevie warning people about the dangerous fog that is sweeping through the town. Stevie advises everyone to go to the local church, which appears to be the only safe place. Nick, Elizabeth and Andy hear the same message and the group gather at the church. Once inside, they and Father Malone take refuge in a small back room as the fog begins to roll outside. Inside the room, Nick and Father Malone find a huge gold cross buried in the walls. The cross is made of the gold that was stolen from Blake and his people a hundred years earlier. As the ghosts of Blake and his crew begin to attack the church, Father Malone takes the gold cross out into the chapel. Knowing he is the offspring of one of the conspirators, Malone confronts Blake in an attempt to sacrifice himself and save everyone else. Back at the lighthouse, two of the ghosts try to attack Stevie. She climbs onto the roof, but the ghosts follow and trap her. Inside the church, Blake seizes the golden cross, which begins to emit an eerie glow. The church rumbles as the light emanating from the cross becomes brighter and brighter. Nick manages to pull Father Malone away from the cross only seconds before it disappears, along with Blake and his crew, in a blinding flash of light. The ghosts attacking Stevie on the roof of the lighthouse disappear as well, and the fog vanishes. Stevie gets back on air and warns the boats out at sea to watch out for the fog. Later that evening, Father Malone is alone in the church pondering why Blake did not kill him and thus take six lives. At that moment, the fog reappears inside the church along with Blake and his crew. As Father Malone turns to face him, Blake swings his sword at Father Malone\'s neck, decapitating him.'] ["Trelkovsky , a quiet and unassuming man, rents an apartment in Paris whose previous tenant, Egyptologist Simone Choule, attempted to commit suicide by throwing herself out the window and through a pane of glass below. He visits Choule in the hospital but finds her entirely in bandages and unable to talk. Whilst still at Choule's bedside, Trelkovsky meets Simone's friend, Stella , who has also come to visit. Stella begins talking to Simone, who becomes aware of her visitors. Initially showing some signs of agitation upon seeing them, Choule soon lets out a disturbing cry, then dies. It isn't clear which of the two has caused this reaction. Apparently unaware that Choule is now dead, Trelkovsky tries to comfort Stella but dares not say that he never knew Simone, instead pretending to be another friend. They leave together and go out for a drink and a movie , where they fondle each other. Outside the theatre they part ways. As Trelkovsky occupies the apartment he is chastised unreasonably by his neighbors and landlord, Monsieur Zy , for hosting a party with his friends, apparently having a woman over, making too much noise in general, and not joining in on a petition against another neighbor. Trelkovsky attempts to adapt to his situation, but is increasingly disturbed by the apartment and its tenants. He frequently sees his neighbors standing motionless in the toilet room , and discovers a hole in the wall with a human tooth stashed inside. He receives a visit and a letter from one Georges Badar , who secretly loves Simone and has believed her to be alive and well. Trelkovsky updates and comforts the man and spends the night out with him. Gradually he changes his breakfast habits like Simone and shifts from Gauloises to Marlboro cigarettes. Trelkovsky becomes severely agitated and enraged when his apartment is robbed, while his neighbors and the concierge  continue to berate him for making too much noise. He becomes hostile and paranoid in his day-to-day environment  and his mental state progressively deteriorates. He buys a wig and woman's shoes and goes on to dress up  and sit still in his apartment in the dead of night. He suspects that Zy and neighbors are trying to subtly change him into the last tenant, Simone, so that he too will kill himself. He has visions of his neighbors playing football with a human head, sees himself staring out of his own window and finds the toilet covered in hieroglyphs. Trelkovsky runs off to Stella for comfort and sleeps over, but in the morning after she has left for work, he concludes that she too is in on his neighbors' plot, and proceeds to wreak havoc in her apartment before departing. At night he is hit by an elderly couple driving a car. He is not wounded too seriously, but receives a sedative injection from the doctor due to his odd behavior—he perceives the elderly couple as landlord Zy and wife—after which the couple returns him to his apartment. A deranged Trelkovsky dresses up again as a woman and throws himself out the apartment window in the manner of Simone Choule, before what he believes to be a clapping, cheering audience composed of his neighbors. The suicide attempt, in fact, wakes up his neighbors, who arrive at the scene together with the police just in time for Trelkovsky to crawl up to his apartment and jump one more time. The end of the movie is enigmatic. Trelkovsky is bandaged up in the same fashion as Simone Choule in the same hospital bed, but we see his and Stella's own visit to Simone. Trelkovsky then lets out the same disturbing cry that Simone had screamed."] ['In their continuing journey to find the feathers that are the fragments of Sakura\'s lost memory, Syaoran, Kurogane, Fai D.

As the search for Jessica begins, the local police and Jessica\'s father Kenneth King  enlist Annie\'s help to see if she can come up with a possible answer. Annie is unable to produce a vision, largely due to the presence of Pearl Johnson , the local sheriff who looks upon Annie\'s trade unfavorably. Annie later receives a vision that Jessica has been killed and her body weighed down by a chain and thrown into a pond. She also sees a fiddle player in the vision, white lilies and a split-rail fence. She returns to Johnson with her findings, and with the information, Johnson decides to search a pond at the home of Donnie Barksdale , a violent alcoholic. Barksdale\'s battered wife, Valerie , gives her permission for the search as Donnie is away fishing. Donnie returns while the search is proceeding. As the police are ready to give up on the search they find the nude and chained body of Jessica King. Donnie is immediately arrested. During his trial for Jessica\'s murder, it is revealed that Jessica and Barksdale had an affair, and Jessica\'s reputation for promiscuity is exposed in open court. The case against Barksdale is strengthened when a scratch on his forearm is proven to have been perpetrated by Jessica during a confrontation at a local bar. Annie also takes the stand, and though her psychic testimony is ridiculed by defense attorney Gerald Weems , Donnie is eventually convicted and sent to prison. A subplot reveals other examples of Annie\'s "gift". Buddy Cole  harbors an intense hatred for his father, and consistently has fits of seemingly unprovoked rage, including incidents with Annie and with Donnie Barksdale. Buddy tries to explain to Annie why he hates his father but Annie is preoccupied and doesn\'t want to listen to the panicky and vulgar Buddy. He asks "If I look into a blue diamond, will I die?" but doesn\'t elaborate. Unable to understand the question, Annie shrugs Buddy off. Soon after, Buddy\'s hysterical mother calls Annie to come to the house as Buddy has snapped and has his father bound to a chair.

Later, Annie receives another vision saying that Donnie is innocent. She asks District Attorney David Duncan  to reopen the case. Duncan refuses, but Annie counters that she will reveal Duncan\'s own involvement with Jessica King, as Annie had caught them making out in the women\'s toilet while at a local dance. Duncan offers her money to keep quiet, but Annie refuses, still wanting justice for Barksdale. Annie tells Principal Collins that Barksdale is not responsible for his fiancée\'s death and that DA Duncan will not reopen the investigation. After driving out to the pond that night with Collins, Annie realizes that Collins is the murderer. He confesses to Annie that he was angry after he discovered that she was cheating on him. Collins attempts to kill Annie, knowing that she\'ll go to the police. Just as he is about to land a fatal blow with a steel flashlight, Buddy Cole shows up and knocks Collins out.

The two drive to the police station with Collins stowed in the trunk. Annie tells Buddy that he will have to return to the mental hospital, and he waits in the car while she goes inside to talk with Sheriff Johnson.

After the interview, Ayaka receives a phone call from the psychic, who warns her that Ayaka can no longer escape "it". She rushes to the psychic\'s house, and finds a library of journals and photos of the foreshadowing newspapers. Ayaka searches the house, and finds the psychic face-down, surrounded by more polaroids with one gripped in her hand. Ayaka tries to shake her awake and realised she\'s dead. She pries the photo from the dead woman\'s hand and stares in shock. She calls Hideki, whom she divorced a couple years before, to meet with him, but he refuses as he believes she\'ll call him insane again. As Hideki hangs up, a newspaper page slaps against his window. The article reveals that one of his students will be the latest victim of a serial killing that has been plaguing the city. Hideki rushes to save his student, but he\'s too late. Hideki meets Ayaka the next morning, and they agree to team up to investigate the Newspaper of Terror. Hideki admits he\'s been receiving premonitions, which increasingly frightens him. Ayaka takes Hideki to the house of Rei Kigata, whom she heard has been researching the Newspaper of Terror. When they arrive at the house, they find it abandoned with dust everywhere. In one room, they find a large stone water basin with shreds of paper on the floor. Some paper walls are written or partly burnt. They find and watch videotapes Kigata used to record his paranormal experiences. In the first video, made 12 years before, Kigata states that he "received" a message about a family dying in a gas explosion, which prompted him to warn the family. Newspapers next day didn\'t mention an explosion. Kigata then wonders the strange grey marks on his arms were the price for changing the future. He\'ll continue to record what happens to him. In the last video, marked "number 32", Kigata, covered entirely in dark grey, simply waves despondently at the camera, and wanders out of the room. Hideki and Ayaka leave the room in Kigata\'s direction and in the next room, they find a figure-shaped ash shadow across a wall and floor. As his premonitions become more frequent, Hideki wonders if he should warn the potential victims. Ayaka begs him not to as she doesn\'t want him to suffer Kigata\'s fate. She admits the truth to why she researched the Newspaper of Terror. They affirm their feelings for each other, and agree to continue investigating. At end of her working day, Ayaka\'s car refuses to start, which prompts her to take a train with her colleague Misato. As she leaves the car, she doesn\'t realise she\'s left her mobile phone on passenger seat. At the apartment, Hideki receives another newspaper front page, revealing a train derailment that will take 100 lives, and Ayaka is among the dead. Hideki calls her cell, which goes unanswered. He rushes to the train station and yanks Ayaka out of the train before the doors close. He hasn\'t the time to reach for Misato and he couldn\'t stop the train either. Hideki and Ayaka watches in despair as the train derails. At Misato\'s funeral, her mother mentions her daughter\'s face was torn off during the accident. Hideki and Ayaka decide to move in together. While packing, she notices dark grey marks on Hideki\'s arm. While sleeping, Hideki is haunted by the ghosts of people killed in accidents as predicted by the Newspaper of Terror. Soon he faces his worst nightmare: reliving the event that ends with his daughter Nana\'s death. His desperate desire to save Nana has him trying to manipulate the accident repeatedly until he figures out a way. He successfully unlocks Nana\'s seatbelt and pushes her out to Ayaka, and stays in Nana\'s place as a runaway truck hits the car. With Nana lying in daze nearby, Ayaka screams at the burning car with her husband stuck inside. Nana glances up as a newspaper page floats through the air. As it lands on the ground, we see a photo of Hideki on the front page.'] ['The story centers around Isaac Hendrix , a young college student studying law and a taxi-cab driver in New Orleans.

Inside the box they discover artifacts belonging to Mater Lachrymarum , the last surviving member of the Three Mothers; an ancient trio of powerful black witches. In particular, the box contains a magic cloak that, when worn by Mater Lachrymarum, increases her powers significantly. The urn is shipped to the Museum of Ancient Art in Rome, where Sarah Mandy , an American studying art restorationworks. Sarah is dating the curator Michael Pierce, a single father who is away from the museum that night. With help from the assistant curator, Sarah opens the box and finds the cloak, a dagger, and three statues representing the three witches. Sending Sarah to her office to retrieve tools to help her translate the text on the artifacts, the curator is promptly attacked by the demonic agents of Mater Lachrymarum. Sarah arrives too late to save her boss  and starts to flee the museum. Unfortunately, she is pursued by Mater Lachrymarum\'s familiar  and is only able to escape when a disembodied voice magically throws open a series of locked doors keeping her trapped inside the museum. Sarah tells the police what happened as she spends the night with Michael and his son. Michael visits the Cardinal who sent him the urn only to find out that, shortly after mailing the urn to him, he had a severe stroke and is now in a coma. An assistant of the priest gives Michael a piece of paper, which the Cardinal was writing on before collapsing. On it is scrawled the name "Mater Lachrymarum". As he leaves the hospital, a pair of witches observe Michael leaving the building. Back in Rome, chaos descends as a wave of mass suicides, murder, and violence engulfs the city. Sarah continues her own research only to be summoned by Michael to his apartment. The witches have kidnapped his young son and won\'t return the boy to him unless he stops his investigation. Sarah begs him to call the police  but Michael refuses to and instead opts to visit a local priest who is a trained exorcist. This goes badly for Michael; the two witches see him and he is soon captured and murdered, along with his son, whose body is cannibalized by the rapidly-expanding coven. However, before he is killed, Michael calls Sarah and begs for her to come and help him. As she makes her way through a crowded train station, Sarah is spotted by a gang of witches who, like so many other witches, have arrived in Rome in order to pledge their loyalty to Mater Lachrymarum. Pursued by the witches and the police, the disembodied voice from before instructs Sarah on how to magically make herself invisible. She uses this to avoid the police detective, though she is forced to kill a witch who catches and corners her on the train. At the priest\'s home, Sarah meets Marta, a fellow white witch and friend of Sarah\'s deceased mother. Realizing that Sarah\'s mother is the voice guiding her, Marta reveals details to Sarah about her parents. Her mother was a powerful white witch who dared to challenge and severely wound Mater Suspiriorum, the eldest and wisest of the Three Mothers. In response to this, Suspiriorum caused the fatal car crash that killed Sarah\'s parents. Though Mater Suspiriorum and her sister Mater Tenebrarum are now dead, their sibling Mater Lachrymarum has emerged from the shadows to bring about the second age of magic, with the fall of Rome as her coming out party. They talk to the priest, only for him to be killed before he can give the two a copy of a book that would explain Mater Lachrymarum\'s backstory to them by a patient of his. Escaping back to the city, Sarah goes to her own home but finds Mater Lachrymarum\'s goons waiting for her. She heads to Marta\'s house, but once again Mater Lachrymarum\'s minions strike and Marta and her lesbian lover are murdered. Fleeing, Sarah spots Michael, who takes her back to his apartment. Unfortunately, Sarah soon realizes that Michael is dead and that Mater Lachrymarum is animating his body in an attempt to kill her. As she burns her lover\'s still-animate body, the ghost of her mother intervenes one final time to grab Michael and banish him  to Hell. Sarah locates a powerful alchemist, who Marta mentioned as her only hope to learn how to fight Mater Lachrymarum. After being briefly paralyzed by the alchemist , the alchemist gives Sarah the only help he has in locating Mater Lachrymarum\'s dwelling. Sarah is given a copy of "The Three Mothers" to read, and from this  Sarah finds Mater Lachrymarum\'s lair; a now run-down and disrepaired mansion. At this point, she is joined by one of the police detectives hunting her and the two go into the catacombs to find Mater Lachrymarum. However, the two become separated, and the detective is tortured alongside the alchemist and his assistant, who dies after his arm is chopped off by one of Mater Lachrymarum\'s minions. Sarah is caught and brought before Mater Lachrymarum, who offers Sarah up to her cannibal followers but makes the mistake of removing her cloak. Sarah, having healed the detective\'s wounds, grabs the cloak and tosses it into a nearby fire. This causes the mansion to collapse as a pillar falls and impales Mater Lachrymarum. With the Mother\'s followers crushed as the caves collapse, Sarah and the detective laugh in horror and shock as they reach the surface, as they realize that the threat of the Three Mothers has been defeated once and for all.'] ['The prologue shows a church in Guatemala in which two men, Ben Mears and Mark Petrie, are filling small bottles with holy water.

After a large crate is delivered to the Marsten House one night, an increasing number of the townsfolk begin to disappear or die in strange circumstances. Both Mears and Straker are initially the main suspects as they are new in town, but it becomes clear that the crate contained Straker\'s mysterious business partner, Kurt Barlow, an ancient master vampire who has come to the town after having sent Straker to make way for his arrival.

Detecting a Cruise ship close by, the ship alters course as ghostly voices shout in German, "Battle Stations! Enemy in sight!" Aboard the cruise ship, the prickly Captain Ashland  is making his final voyage, attended by his replacement, Captain Trevor Marshall , who has brought along his family. Outside, the freighter heads right for them, blasting its horn, and despite Ashland\'s best efforts, collides with the cruise ship, sinking it. The next morning, a handful of survivors, including Marshall, his wife Margaret , their children Robin and Ben, a young officer named Nick , his love interest Lori , the ship\'s comic Jackie , and a passenger, Mrs. Morgan , are adrift on a large piece of wreckage. Ashland surfaces nearby, and is brought aboard barely conscious. Later, the survivors come upon the black freighter, unaware it is the ship which attacked them. Finding a boarding ladder slung from the stern, they climb aboard, but not before the ladder plunges into the sea as the officers try to climb it with the injured Ashland. When all are finally aboard, Jackie tries to rally the survivors with humor, but a cable seizes him by the ankle, and he is lifted and swung outboard by one of the ship\'s cranes, which lowers the thrashing comic into the water before cutting him loose, to be swept astern and lost. Shocked, the survivors explore the corridors of the empty, echoing vessel, finding only cobwebs and 1930s memorabilia. Hatches open and close by themselves and lights go on and off while a swinging block knocks out Nick, who is exploring above deck. Meanwhile, a delirious Ashland hears a disembodied voice speaking to him in German, telling him "This ship has been waiting for you...It is your new ship....Your chance has come!" The others finally set up in a dusty bunk room, and break up to retrieve supplies and the injured Captain. Finding a record player and a movie projector that play by themselves, the survivors come to believe the ship is somehow alive. While watching the projected film , and eating a canister full of candy, Mrs. Morgan becomes grotesquely deformed and stumbles back to the bunk room, where a German-speaking Ashland strangles her. Now awake, and apparently under the ship\'s influence, Ashland dons a German naval officer\'s uniform and announces he is the captain. Marshall and Nick make a horrific discovery: the ship was once a Nazi prison ship, and the ghosts of its victims and crew are still aboard. They both decide to escape, but are thwarted when the ship\'s two lifeboats lower into the sea by themselves and drift away. Despairing, the survivors are further taunted by Ashland, who tosses Lori overboard. Marshall and Nick are attacked by the piercing whine of the ship\'s electronics as the projector now shows films of Adolf Hitler. Nick lunges at Ashland, but instead plunges into a net holding skeletal remains, and Ashland drowns him. Marshall manages to stab a gloating Ashland, apparently killing him and stopping the ship. Searching below, Marshall finds a life raft in a freezer full of the frozen bodies of downed airmen and sailors, but as the children are jumping overboard, Margaret is captured by a resurrected Ashland and is trapped in a chain locker. Marshall is knocked out by Ashland, but awakens in time to find Margaret, who has escaped from the locker. Captain Ashland attempts to shoot the escaping Marshall family with a German rifle, but ran out of bullets. He tossed away the empty gun in frustration to find others ways to destroy the Marshalls. Meanwhile, the ship detects another cruise liner and begins to give chase, ignoring Ashland, who wants it to run down the Marshalls\' raft instead. Trying to re-take control of the ship, Ashland storms into the engine room, but is pushed into the steering gear and crushed. His agonized screams echo through the ship, joining those of its earlier victims. Above, the Marshalls rejoice as the freighter turns and steams away. After drifting for some time, they are spotted by a search helicopter and rescued. Afterwards, the Death Ship is shown steaming along at full speed, ghostly voices once again announcing "Enemy in sight!" in German. It heads for another passenger ship, and the sounds of the collision are accompanied by the triumphant blasting of its horn.'] ['Five teen friends after stealing for a store end up in a gothic cemetery.

The Catholic Church became involved, and she has since been in a Catholic psychiatric hospital in Rome. The film shows a news story and police investigation showing the three members of the clergy whom she murdered. Her daughter, Isabella, learned of the murders from her father, who died three days after telling her. Twenty years later, Isabella  is in the process of filming a documentary about exorcisms and, to find out more about her mother, she visits a school in Rome. She meets two priests, Ben  and David . Ben and David take Isabella with them on an exorcism performed on Rosalita . They bring along medical equipment to determine if it\'s possession or mental illness. Rosalita attacks the crew after spouting out obscene remarks in different languages and accents. She calls Isabella by her name, despite not knowing her. Eventually, they get her under control. When Isabella goes to visit her mother, Maria, in the asylum, she finds that her mother speaks in different accents and has paintings all over the walls. She has inverted crosses carved into her arms and her bottom lip. Maria tells Isabella that killing a child is against God\'s will, then lets out an ear-shattering scream. Isabella tells David and Ben that she had an abortion years ago and her mother had no way of knowing that—another sign that showed possible possession. As the crew prepares to perform an exorcism/analysis on Maria, David worries about losing his job, since the Church does not authorize exorcisms without undeniable proof that the patient is indeed possessed. During the procedure, Maria mentions knowing what Ben did in the past, as well as Isabella\'s child. She breaks free of her restraints and sends Ben flying into the door, also knocking David to the ground. The doctors rush in shortly after. After analyzing the data from the video and audio files, they present the evidence to the Church. David shows many signs of stress, as Ben plays the audio files over and over, listening to the part where Maria says "I know what you did". Ben then finds that there are four different demons speaking in unison in a different clip. David is to perform a baptism at his church, in which Michael tags along to record. The service starts without incident until he holds the baby to start the Immersion Baptism. He then mutters some lines from the Bible and starts forcefully submerging the baby in the holy water, staring blankly at the camera. The crowd of people rush up to save the baby as he passes out. Soon after, Ben finds David at home with blood all over his forearms, eyes rolled back into his head, much the way Maria was during the exorcism. The police arrive, and though it doesn\'t show on film, David somehow acquires an officer\'s handgun and holds it in his mouth. Ben tells him to fight it, but he begins to weep, reciting The Lord\'s Prayer, stopping; forgetting the last few words. He laughs and then shoots himself. Just then, Isabella begins having a seizure. Ben hysterically comes to the realization that Isabella is possessed. As they wait in the hospital, nurses rush into the emergency room and find a nurse on the floor, blood spewing from her neck as other nurses fight to restrain Isabella. Ben and Michael drag Isabella into the hallway and restrain her. They leave with Isabella in a car, heading to get help for a potential exorcism. While Michael drives, Isabella speaks of also knowing the horrible act Ben committed, scaring Ben. She then tries to strangle Michael and Ben is able to pull her off before Michael loses control of the car, but not before she breathes into Michael\'s mouth. He instantly shows signs of possession, and acceleration can be heard as Michael speeds into oncoming traffic, headlong into another car. The camera goes black, and cuts in with short sequences of chaos, most likely of Michael, Isabella and Ben flying through their car windshield, leaving the outcome unknown. After the screen finally cuts to black and the credits start rolling, a title card is shown informing that the case of the Rossi family is still unresolved, followed by another title card directing viewers to a website  "for more information on the ongoing investigation."'] ["Killer Nun  was produced in Italy. It features Anita Ekberg as Sister Gertrude, who is recovering from neurosurgery, although her Mother Superior  dismisses Sister Gertrude's fears about rushed recovery. Unfortunately, soon enough, it becomes clear that Sister Gertrude's fears were legitimate, as the hapless nun spirals into psychosis and addiction to morphine and heroin at the geriatric hospital where she works. As well as initiating a lesbian affair with Sister Matthieu , Sister Gertrude expels concerned Dr Patrick Roland  from the hospital, and a reign of terror is initiated, in which Sister Gertrude inflicts humiliating calisthenics on one group of elderly inmates, stomps on an elderly woman's dentures, reads gory hagiographic details of the lives of tortured saints to her hapless charges and is judged to have thrown an elderly man engaged in sex with a nurse out of a window. As if this weren't enough, Sister Gertrude goes into a nearby town, picks up a man at a bar, and has impersonal heterosexual sex as well. Finally, the Mother Superior is convinced that she must do something about the aberrant behaviour of Sister Gertrude... but is she really the perpetrator of murder, or is someone trying to frame her?"] ['The movie opens with Betty, an affluent suburban housewife and modern-day witch , planning a dinner party. The main dish is to be Timmy , a young boy whom she had captured earlier and chained up in her pantry. To stall her from stuffing and roasting him, the boy tells her three horror stories from the book "Tales from the Darkside".  In the first segment, Michael McDowell adapts Arthur Conan Doyle\'s short story, "Lot No. 249". A graduate student, Bellingham , reanimates a mummy and uses it to take revenge on a pair of crooked college students, Susan , and Lee (played by [[Robert Sedgwick  who conspired to cheat Bellingham out of a scholarship. Their actions \'framed\' him for theft from a museum, which results in his expulsion from the college. In vengeance for his master, the reanimated corpse kills both in rather gruesome ways, each by a step of mummification . After discovering the cause, Susan\'s brother Andy  kidnaps Bellingham, and burns the parchment and mummy that was the cause of it all. It is later discovered that Andy had burned the incorrect scroll, as the reanimated corpses of Susan and Lee, resurrected by Bellingham, close in on Andy in his dorm room.  In the second tale, George A. Romero adapts a Stephen King short story . It is the story of Drogan, a wealthy elderly man (played by [[William Hickey , who uses a wheelchair, and hires a hitman, Halston , for one of the strangest jobs of his career: kill a black cat, which Drogan believes is murderously evil. Drogan explains that there were three other occupants of his house before the cat arrived: his sister, Amanda , her friend Carolyn , and the family\'s butler, Richard Gage . The cat was adopted by Carolyn and Amanda, who ignore Drogan\'s claim that he can sense that the cat is evil. Drogan claims that one by one, the cat killed the other three: first it tripped Amanda, causing her to fall down a flight of stairs; then it clamped on to Carolyn\'s face until she suffocated; and finally, after Gage managed to capture the beast and tried to drive it to the vet to have it put down, it scratched his face, causing Gage to get into a fatal car crash. And each death committed by the cat occurred at midnight. Drogan believes that he is being punished because his pharmaceutical company killed 5,000 cats while testing a new drug. Halston doesn\'t believe the story, but is more than willing to eliminate the cat since Drogan is offering $100,000. Halston soon discovers that the cat is extremely difficult to kill after he tries to kill it several times. Armed with a gun he tries shooting the cat, but instead shoots the clock when startled by the chime. Eventually the cat kills the hitman, forcing itself down his throat and into his stomach. Drogan returns and finds the hitman\'s body on the floor. The clock that was shot by Halston is able to start ticking again, striking midnight. Awakened by the chime, the cat climbs out of the hitman\'s mouth and jumps at Drogan, which causes him to have a fatal heart attack.   The third and final segment is written by Michael McDowell and based on yuki-onna, a spirit or yōkai in Japanese folklore or more specifically Lafcadio Hearn\'s version in Kwaidan: Stories and Studies of Strange Things. In the story, a despondent artist named Preston  witnesses a gruesome murder by a gargoyle-like monster. The monster gets Preston to swear to never speak of what he saw in exchange for a promise to spare his life. After making the promise, Preston meets a beautiful woman named Carola . Preston marries Carola, they have two kids, and Preston has a revival of his art career. But Preston was still tormented by guilt about his silence, and started reconsidering the promise he made to the monster. Preston then tells Carola about that night ten years ago when they met after he had witnessed the killing of a man by a monster which he sculpted to show her. After releasing a heartbroken screech, Carola reveals herself to be the very same creature he made the promise with, lamenting that the promise Preston made to the monster had been broken. As such, she reverts to her previous form, and their children transform into similar monsters as well. Within the shock and despair of such revelations, Preston is killed at \'her\' hands, and she escapes through a skylight with their children. The final scene shows that the gargoyle and children have turned to stone upon a building ledge, staring down at Preston\'s body in remorse.  As Betty makes preparations to cook Timmy, he trips her by throwing some marbles on the floor. Betty slips and falls on her butcher\'s equipment, stabbing herself in the back. Timmy releases himself and pushes her into her own oven. The film ends with Timmy helping himself to a cookie and breaking the fourth wall by asking us: "Don\'t you love happy endings?"'] ['Young violin prodigy Valerio is summoned to study at an exclusive music academy.

Frank is the one driving the car. Her boyfriend, Brad  also there, and so as her mother Laura  and her younger brother Richard . Frank decides to drive through an unknown shortcut using a secondary road, where horrific events follow his family. While driving on the unknown road, Frank falls asleep and almost crashes into another car going in the other direction. Whilst driving, Frank sees a woman in white  with a baby in the surrounding forests. He drives back but finds that the woman is not there. However, while he is looking in the forest, the Woman in White appears at Frank\'s window. He asks her if she is fine as it is apparent that she is in shock after some kind of accident. She is wounded on her forehead. He asks Brad to check if he can use his mobile phone to call 911 but these is no signal on the network. He invites her to have a ride on their car because on the way they had spotted a cabin not far from their location now. But that means someone should give his seat for the woman, and ultimately Marion ended up giving her seat to the woman as she was suffering from traveling sickness and decides to walk to the cabin house. The rest of the family on the car, try to talk to the woman, but she does not respond and they assume she is in shock. Frank then stops at a roadside cabin. Richard leaves to go and masturbate in the woods, and Frank and Laura enter the cabin, leaving Brad alone with the woman in the car. She starts to talk to him, then reveals that her baby is dead. Brad screams and Frank and Laura rush back to the car, only to find that the woman and Brad have disappeared. While the rest of the family are looking for him, Marion, still on her walk, sees Brad in the back window of a black hearse which slowly drives by. Marion runs to her parents to tell them that Brad has been taken, and they go after the car. However, they are forced to stop again because they go over a bump in the road. They find out that the bump is Brad\'s dead body and Marion faints upon seeing his gruesome state. The others carry her into the car and start driving again. Laura announces that her watch stopped at 7:30 P.M., and that all of the other clocks they have also stopped at that time. Richard seriously suggests the possibility of alien activity, but his idea is dismissed. The family then sees a black baby carriage in the road and they stop. Richard gets out to investigate, and plays a joke on his parents, peering in the carriage and pretending that something in there is eating him. Frank and Laura start fighting and Richard tries talking to Marion, who is in shock and does not respond. Richard realizes that the carriage is back in the road and tells his parents, who assume he is playing another joke. Frank moves the carriage once more and resumes driving. He and Laura begin another heated argument, and Marion suddenly announces she is pregnant. This is followed by Richard confessing that he is doing drugs. On their next stop, Richard heads into the forest to smoke and encounters the Woman in White. They begin to kiss, but the woman suddenly rips Richard\'s lower lip off. While fixing the car, the family see Richard in the back of the same slow, black car from before and run after it. Realizing this is fruitless, they start to chase after the vehicle in their own car, but encounter yet another bump in the road. They stop and see that it is Richard\'s burnt dead body. Laura, devastated, reveals that Richard was not Frank\'s son, but was the result of an affair she had in the past. Nevertheless, they put the body in the back of the car, Frank stating that Richard was still his son. Back on the road, Laura begins to show signs of insanity, acting childishly and even drawing a picture of Brad\'s dead body. Frank sees a sign for a destination called "Marcott". He believes this is a naval base, and that they are on a military road which does not appear on the map. In the car, while Laura is sleeping, Frank tells Marion about a story from his childhood: A family in a car encountered a little girl with a school book on the side of the road. They picked her up, but while they were driving, they heard a scream in the back of the car and saw that the girl had disappeared. All that was left was her school book and that book had the last name "Rose". They remembered that everyone in the Rose family had died in a car accident. Frank thinks this connects to their situation, but Marion dismisses his story as folklore. When Laura awakes, she has to vomit, so they stop the car again. She sees a gun in the car, which was going to be a Christmas present for her "gun-obsessed" brother. In her childish, confused state, she believes that the gun is a toy and threatens her husband and daughter with it. Frank angers her by telling her that Richard is dead and she must accept reality, so she shoots him in the leg. However, Marion cleans the wound and they go on the road again with Marion now driving. Laura claims she can see faces outside of the window, but that they all "look so sad". She sees a friend of hers who is dead, and tells Frank to stop the car so that she can see her. Frank refuses, so Laura opens the car door and jumps out. Frank and Marion stop and see that Laura is taken by the hearse. Frank shoots at it, causing it to stop. Laura stumbles towards them. She says she is fine but that her head hurts. Feeling it, she realizes that the back of her skull is split open. She then starts rubbing her brain and relives a night with Allen, the man she had an affair with, and her telling her father she made the cheerleading squad before dying. Frank, distraught, closes her eyes and puts her in the back of the car. Marion and Frank think it is hopeless. Frank puts the gun to his chin, but Marion stops him and they begin to drive on the road again. On their way to Marcott, Frank explains to Marion that Alan was a friend of his back in Detroit. He tells her that Alan had come to him for advice about a married woman he had been having an affair with, wanting to know whether or not to continue with it. Frank encouraged him, reminding him he only lived once. The last time Frank saw Alan was when he told him that the married woman  wanted to end the affair because she now had a little girl  Be the coolest Grandfather ever. This wipes out the possibility that it was all a dream, but the road-sweeper throws the note in with the rest of the garbage.'] ["A teacher moulds the character of children. She is our 2nd mother.

Se-ho, Eun-young, Sun-hee, Dal-bong, and Myung-ho each resent her for different reasons. Se-ho and Eun-young, who were the president and vice-president of their class, are planning on getting married. They remember the time they were belittled by their teacher for being poor. Sun-hee, skinny and beautiful, was made fun of by the teacher for being obese during her years in high school. Dal-bong, who had dreamed of becoming a baseball player, becomes handicapped due to severe corporal punishment. Myung-ho was sexually abused by his teacher. She also used to lock her deformed son {who wore a bunny mask} in the dark basement while the other children made fun of him. Myung-ho's mother, who filed a complaint, was dismissed as a psychopath. As the night of the reunion continues, the students start to die from the hands of a bunny-masked killer. See-ho is killed when the killer stuffs pieces of cutter into his mouth and applies hot water from the teapot. Eun-young is killed when her eyes are stappled, Dal-bong is killed when the killer stuffs black ants into his body and smashes his head with a baseball bat. During the movie, the bunny-masked killer is assumed to be her deformed son, coming back for revenge. As the plot thickens, Sun-hee tries to take revenge on Mrs. Park but fails when Mi-Ja appears and both have a short fight and ends when Mi-Ja throws Sun-hee down a cliff injuring her head and apparently cut in half by the big rocks, the masked killer turns out to be Jung-won, a shy boy who was humiliated in class because he defecated in his pants.

At the end of the movie Mi-Ja lures all her classmates to the reunion and poisons them all. Everything that had supposedly happened to her classmates, actually happened to her. Instead of living terrible lives, as Se-ho had said earlier, they all went off to lead successful and happy lives. In fact, they did visit Ms. Park every year as a class reunion, because they thought of her as a good teacher. At the end of the movie, Mi-Ja kills herself after confronting Ms. Park, who tried to save her but fails due to her health.

Adams himself is actually traumatized by the death of his own daughter. His arrogance and insistence on being right leads him to locking the police away from a suicidal patient named Cheryl and attempting to talk her down himself, only to have Eriq La Salle\'s character Barnett inexplicably appear on the rooftop and reveal jarring truths about Adams, leading to the patient\'s suicide. The death calls a halt to the documentary, and Adams prepares to leave, satisfied that he had discovered the secret behind Barnett\'s real identity, having found and spoken to his mother.

Just before he leaves, Barnett\'s mother arrives and asks him to take a fruit basket to her son, whom Adams has had locked away in solitary in a 24-hour straitjacket as a menace to himself and other patients. The mother asks Adams if he believes in God, and he says no. When he opens the door we see Barnett inside the room in the straitjacket, but while still at the doorway Adams is distracted by an orderly , and when he looks into the room it is empty. He looks out into the hallway at Barnett\'s mom, who takes off her wig revealing a bald head. He chases her around a corner and finds that Barnett\'s mom is now totally Barnett in women\'s clothes. He chases him further and stumbles into a bedroom where he finds himself, bleeding, dying or dead, apparently having killed himself over his daughter\'s death. He then realizes that he is now in a library, and looks around to see the administrator Dr. Delazo sitting on a throne as the devil surrounded by the patients and staff, all horribly transformed, including the recent suicide. The devil says, "Checkmate." Adams tells the assembly that he knows this isn\'t real, and that he knows who he is. The administrator/devil asks him who is he? Adams says he\'s a good man.

Bierce then wakes up and talks to a local bartender about his intentions to join Pancho Villa's revolutionary army. He joins a stagecoach transporting a newlywed couple, John and Mary Newlie, who are traveling to Mexico to preach Christianity. Meanwhile, Johnny Madrid, a dangerous local outlaw, escapes from the gallows and kidnaps his hangman's beautiful daughter, Esmeralda; he receives assistance from Reece, a young woman who wants to become Madrid's apprentice as an outlaw. With the hangman and a local posse on their trail, Madrid meets with his gang who later rob Bierce's stagecoach because of Reece's belief that Bierce holds an invaluable object. The object turns out to be the manuscript for Bierce's new book. Reece is eventually responsible for leading the hangman and his men to Madrid after they free her from a deadly contraption implemented by the outlaw. As night falls, all parties coincidentally seek shelter in an isolated inn that also serves as a whorehouse. The establishment is run by a group of vampires who are led by the high priestess, Quixtla, who targets Esmeralda. All of the hangman's men and the remnants of Madrid's gang are killed by the vampires. Mary is bitten by a vampire and John is revealed as a fraud who only married Mary for her father's money. Meanwhile, Reece's background is revealed and it is discovered that she is an outlaw who killed her entire family. Esmeralda is exposed as a half-human, half-vampire princess, Santanico Pandemonium , and the daughter of Quixtla. Madrid, Bierce, the hangman, Reece, John, Esmeralda, and a few patrons manage to escape into the dungeons beneath the building. Mary attacks John but he manages to kill her but shows regret for tricking her. A patron turns into a vampire following an earlier bite and attacks the group, killing some of them before he is killed. Eventually, the various humans work together to survive the vampire attack, but they are eventually captured. Esmeralda transforms into the vampire princess. Johnny manages to break from his bonds and free the others. Reece and John are killed by the vampires. Esmeralda turns the Hangman into a vampire, but he kills Quixtla before the change is complete, allowing Johnny and Ambrose to escape. As the film ends, Esmeralda screams for Johnny not to leave her. Johnny somberly looks away and joins Ambrose's quest to join Pancho Villa's army. As they leave, the camera zooms out to show the Mayan temple behind the building that house the vampires, a callback to the first movie. After the credits roll, part of the alternative ending is shown; Ambrose is revealed to have told this story to someone in a bar. The listener refuses to believe in vampires. Ambrose offers proof and proceeds to turn into a vampire himself and kill the listener. The original cut showed a completely different outcome of the last fight, Madrid being killed by Esmeralda after a last shot showing Bierce fighting a horde of vampires, who eventually overcome him. The ending was likely changed to keep the running theme of only two heroes making it out alive from the vampire den."] ['In England, Professor Harrington  approaches Dr. Julian Karswell , the leader of a satanic cult, promising to call off an investigation of the cult if Karswell will call off "what he has started". Karswell says that he will do all that he can. After learning that a parchment given to Harrington has disintegrated, he ushers Harrington out. After Harrington arrives at his home, a demon materialises in the woods and approaches Harrington. Fleeing in his car, Harrington crashes into a telegraph pole, which apparently causes falling power lines to electrocute him. Dr. John Holden  arrives in England to attend a convention where Harrington had intended to expose Karswell\'s cult. Holden is informed of Harrington\'s death and that the only link between it and Karswell\'s cult is an accused murderer, Rand Hobart , who has fallen into a catatonic stupor. While Harrington\'s collaborators consider the possibility of supernatural forces, Holden rejects the idea as superstition. Following Harrington\'s notes, Holden visits the British Museum\'s library to examine books on witchcraft. A book Harrington requests is discovered to be missing. He is approached by Karswell, who offers to show Holden his own copy at his mansion. At Harrington\'s funeral, Holden meets the dead man\'s niece, Joanna , who provides him with Harrington\'s diary. The diary reveals Harrington\'s increasing fear of Karswell\'s power. Holden remains sceptical, but goes with Joanna to Karswell\'s mansion the next day.  There, Holden and Karswell mock one another\'s beliefs. A very strong windstorm abruptly starts, which Karswell claims to have created with a spell. When Holden continues to mock him, Karswell grows angry and predicts that Holden will die in three days. {{listen}} At his hotel, Holden and his colleagues discuss Karswell and make plans to further examine Rand Hobart. Harrington\'s diary mentions the parchment passed to him by Karswell; Holden finds a parchment with runic inscriptions, that Karswell secretly passed to him at the library. Powerful winds come through the window, blowing the parchment from his fingers. It nearly burns in the fireplace before Holden rescues and pockets it. Holden begins to feel more uneasy after a visit to Hobart\'s family, who disowned Hobart as "not a true believer". As Holden leaves, the parchment flies from his hand again. Hobart\'s family become fearful and declare Holden to be "chosen". Holden compares the parchment\'s runes to ones inscribed on the nearby stone circle at Stonehenge. Joanna takes Holden to Karswell\'s mother , who has arranged a seance. The medium begins to channel Harrington, who tells them that Karswell has the key to the problem from his book. Holden leaves, dismissive towards both the medium and Mrs. Karswell. That night, Holden breaks into Karswell\'s mansion to examine the book. He is caught by Karswell, but is permitted to leave. Holden leaves through the woods and finds himself being chased by a living ball of smoke. On escaping from the forest, Holden finds that the phenomenon has vanished. He reports the event to the police but feels embarrassed, believing that he is falling for Karswell\'s mindgames. Mrs. Karswell telephones Joanna, imploring her to tell Holden that Rand Hobart knows the secret of the parchment. "All this evil must end, Miss Harrington!", she says, as her son Julian appears and overhears her betrayal. While Holden prepares an experiment to break Hobart\'s stupor, Karswell kidnaps Joanna to prevent her reaching Holden with the message. Under hypnosis, Hobart reveals that he was "chosen" to die by having a parchment with a curse passed to him, but avoided death by passing it to another person. When Holden shows Hobart the parchment he received from Karswell, Hobart goes berserk and throws himself from a window to his death. Informed that Karswell is leaving London by train, Holden, convinced now that he must return the parchment to Karswell to save himself, races to catch it. He finds Karswell with Joanna. Karswell avoids any contact with Holden to guard against the parchment being passed back to him and grows increasingly fearful. When the train stops at the next station, Karswell tries to leave, but Holden manages to sneak the parchment into his coat. As Karswell realises this, the parchment flies from his hands. He chases it down to the tracks, where the parchment burns to ashes. As an oncoming train approaches, a demon appears above it, seizes Karswell, and slashes him, tossing his body onto the tracks. The station crew find his mangled body and believe that he was struck by the train.'] ['The movie opens with a recitation of Romans 8:18: I consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us. It has been five years since Sarah\'s  soulmate Christopher  mysteriously disappeared, riding off in a limousine without explanation. The two had become engaged at the age of twelve, planning to marry when both were eighteen. Sarah has kept to that commitment, believing that Chris will return. She is a devotee of Joan of Arc and has begun to experience her own \'heavenly\' visions and voices. Recently, these visions have grown in intensity. Their content mostly consists of premonitions of trouble or disaster. Sarah\'s mother is a paranoid schizophrenic who berates Sarah constantly; she lives instead with her grandmother, an inveterate television-watcher who takes no interest in her.

At the same time, Dave reveals his own secret; he is Chris. He has been lying to Sarah, leading her down the path for months, because he wanted ironclad proof that she had kept her commitment to him.

The woman turns off the radio and begins to take a bath. Suddenly, a gray-haired, wild-eyed man appears in the bathroom and brutally stabs the woman in her left eye, killing her. The man hacks off her left leg with a machete and leaves with it. The next day at the police station, Detective Pete Thornton reviews the latest murder to a homicidal maniac doing away with nearly five women now, and there are no clues. His chief superior advices him to continue perusing the case. At Fuad Ramses Catering store, Dorothy Freemont, a wealthy socialite, arrives where she arranges for Fuad to cater a party for her daughter Suzette. Fuad agrees to cater the party for Suzette and tells Mrs. Freemont that what he\'s preparing hasn\'t been prepared for over 5,000 years. Mrs. Freemont wants the catering done in two weeks and Fuad tells her that it will be enough time to get the last of his ingredients. After Mrs. Freemont leaves, Fuad ventures to the back storage room where he has a large gold statue of the "mother of veiled darkness" which is the goddess Ishtar. Fuad is repairing a blood rite for her in order for the goddess\'s resurrection. The solution that Fuad mixes in a huge vat contains the parts of the dead women. That evening, two teenagers, Tony and Marcy, make out on a nearby beach when Fuad attacks them, subduing Tony and slicing off the top of Marcy\'s head where he removes her brain to serve as the latest ingredient. Pete Thornton arrives on the scene with the police chief where, after not getting much from the distraught Tony, they interrogate Marcy\'s mother who can only tell Pete that her daughter belonged to a book club. At a local motel, Fuad is staking out the place when he sees a drunken sailor drop his wife off at her room before taking off. Fuad knocks on the woman\'s front door to the room and attacks her when she opens the door. Fuad rips the woman\'s tongue out of her mouth as another ingredient to his \'blood feast\'. Pete continues to investigate this latest killing and also discovers that the latest murder victim also belonged to a book club. Pete attends his weekly Egyptian studies lecture at the local university with his girlfriend, who happens to be Suzette. The lecturer tells them about the Cult of Ishtar, and describes how virginal women were sacrificed to the goddess on a altar as a blood offering to the Egyptian goddess. When the lecture is over, Pete takes Suzette out for a evening drive where she becomes worried about these events and of a serial killer loose in the area. Their date gets interrupted by their car radio which the announcer says that another victim has been found near death. Pete drops Suzette home and races to the hospital where the police chief is there and informs him that the maniac has struck again and hacked off the face of another woman named Janet Blake. Pete questions Janet in her hospital bed, in which the woman, with a bandaged face, tells the detectives that the man who attacked her was old with gray hair with wild eyes, wearing a funny-looking dark suit and he said something which sounded like "Etar". Janet Blake then dies, while Pete can\'t shake the feeling why that word sounds familiar. Fuad receives a letter from Trudy requesting a copy of the book \'Ancient Weird Religious Rites\', of which Fuad Ramses is the author. Fuad calls Trudy\'s home phone number and learns that she\'s staying with Suzette. That afternoon, Fuad stakes out the Freemont residence and kidnaps Trudy from the grounds and takes her to his store. He whips her savagely and collects her blood, the last ingredient to his solution for his goddess. With Trudy missing, Mrs. Freemont insists that the party continue. Pete calls Suzette to inform her that he will be late in arriving. Meanwhile, Fuad arrives with the food that he has cooked at his store. Elsewhere, Pete calls upon the college lecturer and gets more information about the Cult of Ishtar and about the book that Fuad Ramses had wrote and figures out that Fuad is the killer since all the victims were women who personally called upon him to send them copies of his book. Pete and the police race over to Fuad Ramses\' store and find Trudy\'s chopped-up body in the back of the store. Pete tries to call Suzette to warn her, but at coincidently the same time, Fuad cuts the phone line to the Freemont house. At the Freemont party, Fuad is ready with the food, but he first asks Suzette to come into the kitchen to help him. He has Suzette lie on a counter, which he makes his altar, and says a prayer to Ishtar, as he prepares to stab her in the chest with a butcher knife as a final offering to his goddess. But this takes forever because she can\'t take him seriously. Dorothy Freemont interrupts Fuad just as he\'s about to stab Suzette, and Fuad escapes just as the police arrive. Pete and the rest of the police chase Fuad through a nearby garbage dump where Fuad attempts to escape by climbing into the back of a departing garbage truck. But the truck\'s compact blades turn on and Fuad is crushed to death. The police stop the truck and see there\'s not much left of Fuad Ramses as Pete puts it, "he died a fitting end, just like the garbage he was."'] ['The film\'s plot revolves around the coming of the Apocalypse, heralded by the imminent liberation of the Antichrist from the depths of Hell through a certain gateway at the close of one full millenium. This gate can only be opened by a special key, which has been kept guarded by the order of the Templars . The key in turn is sought out by the servant of the Antichrist, simply known as the Minion, a demonic spirit that transfers itself into the next available host body when his previous one is killed off. His first attempt to gain the key at the close of the year 999 is foiled; the sole surviving Templar of the company charged with hiding the key eventually takes off with a ship to the west, to what was at that time known as the "end of the world", to keep it from the Minion\'s grasp. A thousand years later, near Christmas of 1999, two city engineer workers accidentally find a hidden Templar burial chamber beneath New York City. A Mohawk archeologist, Karen Goodleaf, is tasked with the examination of the chamber and its contents, but then the Minion attacks. Before he can claim the key, however, he is hindered by a man in priest garb, who kills the Minion\'s host body with a blow from a spiked gauntlet to a certain part of the neck and then takes the key for himself. Startled and confused, Karen chases after the man, who gradually introduces himself as "Lukas". Lukas Sadorov is a Templar and a former Speznas who deserted the Soviet army following a massacre on civilians in Afghanistan, sent by the head of his order to recover the key. After a lot of insistence, Karen tags along with Lukas and eventually gains his trust, and after having seen the Minion in action, she decides to aid him in his quest by proposing to hide the key in a nuclear waste depository built on the grounds of her childhood reservation home, whose resident radioactivity would theoretically prevent the Minion\'s host bodies from claiming the key. She enlists the help of her grandfather, Michael Bear, a Mohawk shaman who works as a foreman at the depository plant, in order to gain access to the facility. However, the Minion repeatedly takes over people who unwittingly come into contact with his previous, if disabled host bodies, enabling him to continue his relentless pursuit. He finally takes possession of Karen\'s former archeology tutor, Professor Schulman, who is providing assistance to the NYPD during the investigation of the apparent serial murder case, and tricks the police into opening a manhunt on Lukas. After killing Karen\'s grandfather and donning his radiation suit as a disguise, he tricks Lukas into giving him the key and escapes with it to Jerusalem, the location of the Templar\'s sanctuary and the gate to Hell hidden within its crypts. The Minion arrives at the Templars\' headquarters just before Lukas and Karen do, taking the Templars by surprise and killing most of them. Bernhard, one of the Templar Knights, manages to kill the Minion, but in his eagerness to prove himself better than Lukas, he accidentally allows the Minion to take possession of him and thus insert the key into the gate. Lukas and Karen arrive shortly after, and while Karen tries to remove the key from the lock, Lukas battles the possessed Bernhard and kills him. Together, he and Karen, although tempted by the Antichrist himself, manage to prevent the gate\'s unlocking just before the final seal on the door is burst. With the Templars decimated, Lukas decides to rebuild the order, and Karen spontaneously declares to join him in his efforts, marking the dawn of a new generation of Templars to guard the gate and the key.'] ['Anna Veigh is an art teacher that seems to get too involved in her students\' private lives. She is called into the headmaster\'s office and chastised for  attempting to be an "art therapist" rather than an art teacher. The headmaster makes inappropriate advances, touching her leg and putting his arm around her as he informs her that she is on "the wrong track". Later, the headmaster calls and leaves a message on her answering machine in which we find that she has been fired and something has occurred in the office that he wishes to "keep secret". He informs her that he has found her a job as a nanny that pays very well. The next day she attends an interview for the job and is hired on the spot by the wealthy and mysterious Mr. Laing to become the nanny for his niece and nephew - two wealthy young orphans - whilst he is away on business. It seems a perfect escape for her, a welcome change. Her new workplace is Bly House, a remote country estate with beautiful grounds and a small resident staff. Miles and Flora, the children, seem sweet and charming, if a little strange, and Anna thinks that she has really "landed on her feet" after the rigors of her previous job. The only fly in the ointment is the frosty estate manager, Miss Grose, who seems remote and unfriendly to the new arrival. Anna soon begins to make disquieting discoveries. Miles, the boy, has been expelled from his school, for a sin so dreadful the headmaster will not even discuss it. Anna hears whispers through the night often leading towards Flora\'s bedroom. Anna then learns that her predecessor in the job, one Miss Jessel, drowned in a lake on the property. Her lover, Mr. Quint, hanged himself in Bly House shortly thereafter. The children continue to commit devilish seeming acts, that lead her to question the children. To add to her unease, Anna begins to catch glimpses of unknown sinister figures lurking in the grounds, but nobody else admits to seeing them. Anna confronts Miss Grose with her suspicions about the intruders and is surprised learn that Miss Grose had hated Mr. Quint for stealing her lesbian lover, Miss Jessel. The figures Anna describes are unmistakably Miss Jessel and Mr. Quint, but these former employees have been dead for some time. Anna has recurring daydreams concerning her own abuse as a child, and she soon suspects that Mr. Quint and Miss Jessel may have physically abused Miles and Flora as well. As Anna\'s ghost sightings and fears for the children\'s safety become more pronounced, Miss Grose begins to doubt Anna\'s sanity and fires her from her post. As Anna reveals some affection for the estate manager, Miss Grose reconsiders and begins to passionately kiss Anna. While they later sleep together that evening, it is apparent on Anna\'s face that she is shocked by the estate manager\'s physical attention and feels that she is again being abused just as when she was a child. It seems as if Anna is being sexually abused by every character in the movie, highlighting her disturbing childhood. Eventually, the children grow more and more fearful and sullen around Anna. Anna\'s hallucinations and emotional breakdown continue, and Miss Grose once again tells her to leave. Anna frequently visits the lake that Miss Jessel had supposedly drowned in, yet tells the children not to go there. She seems possessed and has frequent sightings of Miss Jessel there. After some strange behaviour on the children\'s part and Anna\'s, it is unclear what exactly is going on. That evening, Flora has a severe fear-induced asthma attack and is taken away by ambulance, never to be seen again. Miles runs away, and before accompanying Flora to the hospital, Miss Grose makes Anna promise to call her as soon as Miles is found. Anna finds and chases the frightened Miles about the estate believing that only she can rescue him from the ghosts\' attentions. As she corners him at the lake where Miss Jessel drowned, Miles in a sense "walks the plank", slowly forcing himself into the water and drops from the log into the shallow creek-like puddle where Miss Jessel\'s previous body parts had been shown. There is no struggle. Anna tells him that he will now be free of his suffering and that what happened between them will remain a secret. It is suggested that Anna had been physically abusing Miles and Flora just as she had been abused as a child herself, but the truth is no one really knows, if she is insane and imagining these images or being harassed by ghostly figures. Then without any real explanation or even implication, her face suddenly turns into herself as a little girl and says "I\'m the only one." We are left questioning if her mind was in fact the "dark place" or if in fact the house was truly haunted.'] ["In Thailand, young Ton Chatree  is sent to a boarding school by his father to get good grades and not tell his mother about his father having an affair.

As the investigation proceeds, the agents begin to become aware of the possible existence of "Suspect Zero", a mythical "super serial killer" responsible for hundreds of deaths across all 50 states who leaves no evidence behind to link his crimes together. The agents must decide if O\'Ryan is the key that will allow them to catch Suspect Zero, or if he is Suspect Zero himself. As it turns out, O\'Ryan was part of a secret government experiment attempting to cultivate telepathic abilities in individuals for military purposes. The experiments gave O\'Ryan the ability to see the actions of serial killers. These disturbing visions constantly torment O\'Ryan, and drive him to find the killers and kill them. O\'Ryan seeks out Mackelway because Mackelway shares his abilities to some degree and was involved in a controversial case that made headlines. O\'Ryan hunts down Suspect Zero, whose child victims are giving O\'Ryan even more nightmares. The actual "Suspect Zero" is another man who travels over the United States with a refrigerated truck. He targets children, whom he kidnaps and transports to his ranch to be killed. He is not THE Suspect Zero, however, as Mackelway had identified evidence linking his crimes together: Because of the time spent locked in the truck, all of his victims had signs of freezer burns. Eventually, Mackelway and O\'Ryan find Suspect Zero at his ranch. After a struggle outside, Suspect Zero is killed when Mackelway crushes his skull with a rock. O\'Ryan then tries to convince Mackelway to end his suffering by killing him. When Mackelway refuses, O\'Ryan pretends to attack him, prompting Kulok  to shoot him to defend her partner. A major motif of the film is remote viewing, and the DVD\'s extra features include interviews with people who worked with the US military and intelligence agencies as part of those programs.'] ['{{Plot}} The film opens with Gordon Cole  calling Agent Chester Desmond  about the mysterious murder of Teresa Banks in the town of Deer Meadow.

Later that day, Laura realizes pages are missing from her secret diary, and tells her friend, the agoraphobic Harold Smith , about it. She claims BOB took the pages. Harold tells Laura that BOB is not real. Laura argues that BOB is real and says that he told her that if she does not let him be her, he will kill her. When Harold argues, Laura says "fire walk with me", her face changing color. Returning to normal and visibly shaken, Laura gives Harold her diary to keep. She leaves, stating she does not know when, or if, she will return. Meanwhile, Cooper tells fellow agent Albert Rosenfield  he believes the killer will strike again and describes the appearance of who he believes the victim will be. During her Meals on Wheels rounds, Laura sees Mrs. Chalfont  and her grandson. Chalfont gives Laura a painting, and her grandson informs Laura that the "man behind the mask" is in Laura\'s room. Laura runs home, where she sees BOB. After Laura rushes outside in terror, she sees her father, Leland , emerge from the house. Laura then realises her father could be BOB. Later that evening, when the Palmer family is about to eat, Leland, upon seeing the half-heart necklace, menaces Laura and questions her about her "lovers." Looking at her finger, Leland insinuates there is dirt underneath the nail. Later, Leland sits on the edge of his bed and suddenly begins to weep. He goes into his daughter\'s bedroom and tells her that he loves her. After he is gone, Laura looks to a picture of an angel on her wall, asking if Leland is really BOB. Remembering the painting she received from Chalfont that she left on the front lawn, Laura goes outside to get it. After hanging it on her wall, she falls asleep. She dreams about entering the Black Lodge and about a ring. Suddenly Cooper enters the room and we see the Man from Another Place.

When she turns she sees herself sleeping peacefully in her bed. Laura awakens in the morning, and the ring is gone from her hand. Disturbed, she removes the painting from her wall. Meanwhile, Bobby, Leo, and Jacques Renault discuss drug scores. Bobby first phones Leo asking to score more drugs, but Leo hangs up on him. Bobby then calls Jacques at the Roadhouse who agrees to send someone to meet with him in "two days midnight at the sound of sawing wood." That evening, Laura is ready to go to the Roadhouse when Donna tells her of her wish to accompany her, but Laura says she is not invited. As Laura is about to enter the bar, she encounters the Log Lady. Inside the bar, Jacques introduces Laura to two men. The group is about to leave for the Pink Room to have sex, but Donna shows up and wants to come too; impressed by her "audition" kiss, they let her. In the Pink Room, Laura discusses Teresa Banks\' murder with Ronette Pulaski , mentioning the girl\'s hopes of becoming rich by blackmailing someone, then engages in oral sex with the men. Laura is distraught, not with seeing Donna topless but with the jacket she is wearing. It is Laura\'s jacket. Jacques Renault carries her out and Laura and takes her home. The next morning, Laura tells Donna that she does not want Donna to become like her. Leland arrives, becomes blank faced and has a memory of Ronette and Laura laughing on a bed together. Leland takes Laura to breakfast. On the way there, MIKE , the one-armed man, shouts madly at Leland from his pick up truck during a traffic jam at the stoplight in town. Mike accuses Leland of stealing corn. He tells Laura "The look on her face when it was opened… There was a stillness like the formica table top." He shouts at Leland that "the thread will be torn". Showing Laura the ring, Mike attempts to tell her that her father is BOB but both Leland and Laura scream, preventing her from hearing. Leland pulls into a gas station parking lot to gather his wits and recalls his affair with Teresa. After having set up a foursome with Teresa\'s friends, Leland had fled in fear, discovering that Laura was one of them. This led to Teresa discovering who her "John" really was. Leland was the man she was blackmailing. Sensing a change in her father\'s behaviour, Laura questions him about seeing him on the day she found BOB looking for the diary. Later that night, Laura realizes that the ring she saw was the same one from her dream. Leland remembers killing Teresa. The next night, Laura and Bobby take cocaine in the woods, and Jacques sends a drug messenger who is the Sherriff\'s deputy from Deer Meadow, carrying an enormous amount of cocaine.

Leland gives Sarah Palmer valium to sedate her. After she drifts off to an undisturbed sleep, Leland walks into the hallway to turn on the fan. BOB comes through Laura\'s window and begins raping her. She realizes that BOB has taken over her father. The next morning, distraught, she warns Leland to stay away from her. Upset over the realization her father is actually BOB, Laura cannot concentrate at school. Laura later refuses sex with Bobby, and he finally realizes that Laura was using him to get the cocaine. Still caring for Laura and sensing her pain, Bobby gives her his own drugs. The Angel in Laura\'s painting disappears. In the woods. Laura tells James "his Laura" is gone. Screaming that she loves him, Laura runs away from James deeper into the woods. Laura meets Ronette, Jacques, and Leo, and they hold an orgy in Jacques\' cabin as Leland watches from outside. Jacques wants to have hard sex, and ties Laura up. Leland attacks Jacques outside, and Leo flees in panic. Leland takes Laura and Ronette, both bound, to the train car. Meanwhile, Mike realizes that BOB/Leland is about to kill again and chases after him. As he is tying Laura up a second time, she asks Leland if he is going to kill her. He does not answer. Leland places a mirror in front of her. She screams after seeing her reflection turn into BOB. BOB is real. He tells Laura that he wants her. Ronette prays. She breaks down stating that she is not ready because she is "dirty". Suddenly an angel appears in the train car as all actions stop. The angel causes both Ronette and Laura\'s hands to become unbound. Hearing Mike outside begging to be let in, Ronette, now free, is able to help him open the door. When Leland sees Ronette trying to let him in, he knocks her unconscious and kicks her out of the train car. Mike is able to use this moment to throw in his ring. Laura, whose hands are also free now, wears the ring, preventing BOB from becoming her. Angered that he can\'t be her, BOB kills her as he promised by stabbing her repeatedly. BOB/Leland places Laura\'s body in the lake. As her corpse drifts away, BOB/Leland enters the Black Lodge, where he encounters Mike and the Man from Another Place . They tell BOB that they want all their garmonbozia . BOB heals Leland\'s wound. Laura\'s body washes up on the lake shore where it is found by the Sheriff\'s department the following morning. Laura\'s spirit later sits in the Black Lodge, and notices Agent Cooper at her side, who has a hand on her shoulder. Laura looks deeply saddened until her angel appears, and she begins to cry, and then laugh. The film ends with Laura\'s face in white.'] ['At the North Bend Psychiatric Hospital in 1966, a young patient named Tammy is attacked and killed by an unseen force during the night.

On her way to her final appointment with Dr. Stringer, Sarah flirts with a nurse, but is rejected. She then goes to the other girls and asks Kirsten what happened to her plan and also seemingly gives her a clue that they did not find Iris because they were "not looking into the right places."

Believing Ray\'s soul to still be inhabiting the doll, Tiffany crudely stitches Chucky back together and reenacts the voodoo ritual which instilled Ray inside the doll a decade ago. Though her chants initially fail to produce results, Chucky unexpectedly springs to life and kills Tiffany\'s goth-wannabe admirer, Damien , torturing him by ripping off his labret piercing while his hands and feet are cuffed, and suffocating him with a pillow while Tiffany watches with excitement. Tiffany and Chucky then get into an argument because Tiffany believed Chucky wished to marry her. Upon learning he had no intention of doing so, Tiffany throws him in a playpen she built for a nursery and locks him in it. She then later gives him another doll in a wedding dress with a real diamond ring to mock him. While Tiffany is watching TV while taking a bath, Chucky escapes by cutting through the wood of the play pen with the diamond part of the ring and kills her by pushing the TV into the bath. Then, using the same voodoo spell, Chucky gains further revenge against Tiffany by transferring her soul into a female doll so she could feel what Chucky went through as a living doll. Chucky, who is still intent on becoming human again, concocts a plan with Tiffany to retrieve an amulet that was buried with Ray\'s body and use the bodies of Tiffany\'s neighbor Jesse  and his girlfriend Jade  as a means to return to their normal lives. Tiffany sends Jesse a message asking him to take the two dolls to New Jersey in exchange for cash. Jesse convinces Jade to go with him and helps her pack. Meanwhile, Jade\'s police-officer uncle Warren  breaks into Jesse\'s car and plants a bag of marijuana to frame Jesse, whom he dislikes. Afraid of him ruining their plans, Chucky and Tiffany kill him by setting up an airbag to launch nails into his face. After the dolls hide the body under the backseat, Jesse and Jade return and begin their trip. Outside a convenience store, they are pulled over by Officer Norton, who asks to search Jesse\'s car for the planted drugs. After he finds it, he goes to his car to report to Warren. During this time, Chucky crawls over and shoves a cloth into Norton\'s gas tank and lights it. Norton is killed when his car explodes and, seeing the explosion, Jesse and Jade flee the scene. Soon, they stop at a wedding chapel/hotel and are married. During that time, Jade\'s uncle, still alive, tries to run away but is stabbed numerous times in the back by Chucky. While in the hotel, Jesse and Jade meet a con-artist couple Russ and Diane  who steal Jesse\'s money. As the criminals have sex in their room, Tiffany, who had seen them take Jesse\'s money and said how the woman "doesn\'t deserve to wear that ring", takes their bottle of champagne and throws it into the mirrored ceiling, sending down shards of glass and killing the two con-artists. Impressed at what she just did, Chucky reveals his true feelings for Tiffany, and then proposes to her. After accepting and putting on the ring, both dolls begin to have sex. The next morning, a maid  finds the corpses of the couple and Jesse and Jade drive away with their best friend David, who knew about their plan to elope and heard about the recent murders. He reveals that Jesse and Jade have been pinned for all of the deaths and, while searching for the source of a foul smell, finds Warren\'s body and demands that Jesse pull over. While he is confronting them, the dolls come alive and hold them hostage with guns, demanding for them to keep driving. David turns and is accidentally broken by a truck that taxes speeding, horrifying Jade and Jesse. Jesse and Jade drive away with the dolls. They are then chased by police, which Chucky is able to shoot the cars and make them go off the road. During that time, the dolls reveal their plan to them and get Jesse to drive in a mobile home to keep the cops off them by using a different vehicle. While preparing Jade for the body-switch, Tiffany begins talking with Jade, who manages to turn Tiffany against Chucky. A fight between the two dolls ensues and Jade seizes an opportunity by kicking and locking Tiffany into the oven while Jesse pushes Chucky out the window. Chucky shoots at Jesse, causing the RV to run off the road and into a ditch. Chucky finds Jade and forces her to take him to his grave site, while Jesse takes a weak Tiffany  and follows them. While the medical examiner is digging, Chucky shoots him in the back of the head and orders Jade to open the casket and give him the amulet. After she breaks it off his skeleton\'s neck, she throws it out at him. Jesse then appears with Tiffany and they trade hostages. While Jesse and Jade embrace, Chucky is about to throw his knife at Jade until Jesse sees and turns her around; being stabbed in the back. After Jade pulls the knife out of his back and holds him, they are tied up for the ritual. Before Chucky starts the body-switching chant, Tiffany distracts him by kissing him while she pulls the knife out of his pocket, stabbing him in his back. They fight until he stabs her in the heart, where she collapses to the ground. While distracted, Jesse knocks Chucky into his grave who demands to be let out. A private investigator arrives to see Jade pointing a gun into the hole. He sees Chucky and is clearly shocked by what he sees. The investigator then watches Jade shoot Chucky several times while he yells he\'ll come back as he always comes back. The investigator soon gets on the phone with the police, saying that Jesse and Jade are innocent of the murders and sends the couple away. While stumbling upon and investigating Tiffany\'s doll body, Tiffany suddenly springs to life and gives birth to a doll child before finally dying. The baby seems to attack the investigator as the film ends, thus setting the scene for Seed of Chucky to begin.'] ['The film opens the night Jesse and Jade get married in Bride of Chucky as the second parody of Look Who\'s Talking in the Child\'s Play series where Chucky\'s sperm reach Tiffany\'s egg and a baby is conceived and grown over time.

When she goes to the surface, the sunlight blinds her and erases her memory. She becomes very ill and eventually dies. The king believes that her spirit will come back to the underworld someday. In post-Civil War Spain in 1944  Ofelia, a young girl who loves fairy tales, travels with her pregnant mother Carmen to meet Captain Vidal, her new stepfather and father of Carmen\'s unborn child. Vidal, the son of a famed commander who died in Morocco, believes strongly in falangism and was assigned to root out any anti-Franco rebels. Ofelia discovers a large insect resembling a stick insect which she believes to be a fairy. It follows her to the mill where Vidal is stationed and leads Ofelia into an ancient labyrinth nearby. Before Ofelia can enter, she is stopped by Mercedes, one of Vidal\'s maids who is spying for the rebels. That night, the insect appears in Ofelia\'s bedroom, where it changes into a fairy and leads her through the labyrinth. There, she meets the faun, who believes her to be Princess Moanna and gives her three tasks to complete before the full moon to ensure that her "essence is intact". Meanwhile, Vidal\'s cruel and sociopathic nature is revealed when he brutally murders two individuals who had been detained on suspicion of being rebel allies and who may merely have been farmers. Ofelia completes the first task of retrieving a key from the belly of a giant toad, but she becomes worried about her mother whose condition is worsening. The faun gives Ofelia a mandrake root, which instantly begins to cure her mother\'s illness. Accompanied by three fairy guides, Ofelia then completes the second task of retrieving an ornate dagger from the lair of the Pale Man, a child-eating monster who sits silently in front of a large feast. Although she was gravely warned not to consume anything, she eats two grapes, awakening him. He eats two of the fairies and chases her, but she manages to escape. Infuriated at her disobedience, the faun refuses to give her the third task. Meanwhile, Vidal becomes increasingly vicious, torturing a captured rebel and then killing the doctor — also a rebel sympathizer — who euthanized the tortured prisoner to stop his pain. Vidal catches Ofelia tending to the mandrake root, and Carmen throws it into the fireplace, where it then begins to writhe and scream in agony. Instantly, Carmen develops painful contractions and dies giving birth to a son. Vidal discovers that Mercedes is a spy, and he captures her and Ofelia as they attempt to escape. Ofelia is locked in her bedroom, and Mercedes is taken to be tortured; however, she frees herself, badly injures Vidal and flees into the woods, where the rebels rescue her. The faun returns to Ofelia and gives her one more chance to prove herself. He tells her to take her baby brother into the labyrinth. Ofelia steals the baby after sedating Vidal; although disoriented, Vidal continues to chase her through the labyrinth while the rebels attack the mill. The faun tells Ofelia that the portal to the underworld will open only with an innocent\'s blood, so he needs a drop of her brother\'s blood. Ofelia refuses to harm her brother, and eventually Vidal finds her, seemingly talking to herself as the faun is not visible through his eyes. The faun leaves Ofelia to her choice, and Vidal takes the baby away from her, shooting her immediately after. When he leaves the labyrinth, the rebels and Mercedes are waiting for him. Knowing that he will die, he calmly hands Mercedes the baby. Vidal takes out his watch and tells Mercedes to tell his son the exact time of his father\'s death. Mercedes interrupts, telling him that his son will never even know his name. Pedro, one of the rebels and Mercedes\' brother, draws his pistol and shoots Vidal in the face, killing him. As Mercedes enters the labyrinth and comforts the dying girl, drops of Ofelia\'s blood spill onto the altar that is supposed to lead her into the underworld. Ofelia is reunited with the king and queen of the underworld. The faun is present too, and the king reveals to her that, by shedding her own blood instead of the blood of an innocent, she has completed the final task and proven herself to be Princess Moanna. In the mortal world, Ofelia dies and Mercedes mourns her death. In an epilogue, a narration dictates that Princess Moanna ruled the underworld with a just and kind heart, but left behind "small traces of her time on earth, visible only to those who know where to look".'] ['While on a tour in Hollywood, a young couple, Joel and Donna Gregory , arrive at the house of Lorna Love, an infamous actress who died in 1935.

Stonehenge has begun to move independently, build up an electromagnetic charge and release enough energy to vaporize people within a certain radius. Jacob theorizes that Stonehenge is actually at the center of a massive ancient terraforming machine, but must convince the scientists and military on site of this before it is too late and all life on Earth is destroyed in a series of volcanoes which are connected to Stonehenge through the Earth's electromagnetic field. Meanwhile Joseph Lesham - of the somewhat ambiguous past connection to Jacob - is actively working towards Earth's destruction in hopes that his followers  will survive the Apocalypse, waiting it out in a heretofore undiscovered pyramid in Maine, and become the progenitors of the next era of life on Earth.

Seven years later, the Scorpion King and his army are defeated and exiled to the desert of Ahm Shere. His men die of heat exhaustion, leaving only the Scorpion King. Vowing to give Anubis his soul for the power to defeat his enemies, an oasis is created to hide the Scorpion King's pyramid and giving him a legion of demonic, humanoid jackal warriors to seek revenge. The Army of Anubis sweeps across Egypt, destroying everything in its path, but once their task is finished Anubis claims the Scorpion King's soul and his army. In 1933, Rick and Evelyn O'Connell explore a ruined mortuary structure in the ancient Egyptian city of Thebes with their son, Alex. They find the Bracelet of Anubis. In London, Alex puts on the bracelet, which provides him with directions to the oasis of Ahm Shere. Alex has seven days to reach the oasis, or the bracelet will kill him the moment the rays of the sun shine on the Scorpion King's pyramid; at that point the Scorpion King and his army will also reawaken. Alex is captured by an Egyptian cult who have resurrected Imhotep; they wish to use Imhotep's power to defeat the Scorpion King, which would give him command of the Army of Anubis. The cult, led by Baltus Hafez, the curator of the British Museum, includes a warrior named Lock-Nah and Meela Nais, the reincarnation of Imhotep's love Anck-su-namun. The O'Connells set out to rescue Alex, accompanied by Evelyn's brother Jonathan and the Medjai Ardeth Bay. Rick's associate from his past adventures, Izzy, a pilot, provides the group transportation. The bracelet of Anubis gives Alex visions, directions to Ahm Shere that the cult follows. At each location, Alex leaves clues for his parents, who follow in Izzy's dirigible. Imhotep uses the Book of the Dead to give Meela Nais the soul of Anck-su-namun but by doing so he also allows Evelyn to unlock the memories of her previous life as Princess Nefertiri, keeper of the bracelet of Anubis and the daughter of Pharaoh Seti I. Lock-Nah discovers that Alex has been leaving clues, so Imhotep makes a wall of water that attacks the dirigible. The O'Connells crash in Ahm Shere. Izzy stays with the dirigible in hopes of repairing it. The O'Connells attack the cult, and both groups are attacked by pygmy mummies. Rick retrieves Alex while Ardeth Bay kills Lock-Nah. They escape from the pygmies, which kill most of the cult except for Baltus. Imhotep and Anck-su-namun are unharmed due to Imhotep's powers and Anck-su-namun being the keeper of the Book of the Dead. Rick and Alex run to the pyramid, barely making it before sunrise. The bracelet detaches from Alex's arm. Ardeth regroups with the Medjai in case the army of Anubis rises. Anck-su-namun stabs Evelyn and kills her. Rick, grieving, pursues Imhotep. Baltus puts on the bracelet and revives the army of Anubis. As Imhotep walks into the pyramid, Anubis takes his powers, wanting Imhotep to fight as a mortal. Rick finds Imhotep summoning the Scorpion King and they fight. The Medjai engage the army of Anubis. The Scorpion King interrupts Rick and Imhotep's fight. Imhotep tells the Scorpion King that he is the Scorpion King's slave, but Rick was sent to kill him. During Rick and the Scorpion King's fight, the Scorpion King kills Baltus. Jonathan and Alex collaborate to steal the Book of the Dead from Anck-su-namun. Alex uses the book to resurrect Evelyn, who duels with Anck-su-namun. Alex and Jonathan go to help Rick. It is revealed that the scepter that Jonathan has been carrying extends into a spear that can kill the Scorpion King. The Medjai seemingly defeat Anubis' army despite heavy casualties, but see that they have only defeated the vanguard, and the full army is charging towards them. However, before the Anubis warriors hit the Medjai lines, Rick succeeds in killing the Scorpion King, sending him and his army back to the Underworld. The Scorpion King's death causes Anubis to turn the oasis back into a desert, and the oasis is being sucked into the pyramid. Rick and Imhotep are hanging from the edge of a pit that leads into the underworld. Evelyn risks her life to save Rick, but Anck-su-namun refuses to save Imhotep, who is heart-broken about this, and he lets go into the underworld to his death. Anck-su-namun, running away from the pyramid, falls into a scarab-filled pit, where she is bitten and suffocated to death. The O'Connells reach the top of the pyramid, which is being sucked into the desert. Izzy arrives with a modified dirigible and saves the O'Connells. Jonathan grabs the diamond at the top of the pyramid. Ardeth Bay salutes them as they fly over him."] ['Amber Williams , her friends Zoe  and Roger , and her boyfriend Colby Patterson  stage a prank at the town carnival, with Roger faking the return of the "Fisherman" killer.

She drives to Zoe\'s shack to find her band rehearsing for a concert, and after Amber apologizes for not contacting her, Zoe allows her to sleep there for the night. The next day they find Roger fixing ski-lifts gondolas; he angrily sends them away when they inform him someone knows what happened. Zoe goes to find Colby working as a lifeguard at a public pool; he dismisses her then returns to his post to find "I know what you did last summer" written in the ground. Amber is attacked on a ski-lift by someone wielding the hook, but Colby does not believe her. Later that night, a drunken Roger contemplates suicide while pulling out the hook from the prank, which he had salvaged from the fire. He investigates a noise when he is attacked by the Fisherman, who slits his throat after a chase. Colby goes to Amber and Zoe telling them that he believes them, so they go to warn Roger again but find him dead along with a suicide note and the hook. Deputy Haffner strangely shows up wielding his gun at them, accusing them of the murder, until he reads the suicide note. After their statements, they return to Amber\'s house to find pictures of them from the high school yearbook sliced up and stuck to the wall reading "SOON". They all stay at Zoe\'s place again and find Lance  outside, who shows them a message engraved on his motorbike, and they agree to stay together for safety. Colby goes to the pool to do some laps after his shift, and is hooked in the ankle by the Fisherman, who disappears. The night of Zoe\'s concert, Amber and Lance stick together while Colby, who is now on crutches, sneaks off to get drunk. The Fisherman swings his hook at Colby but misses; Colby grabs a large butcher knife and stabs the Fisherman in the back, but he appears to be completely unharmed. The Fisherman eventually breaks through a window and hooks Colby in the mouth. Amber and Lance go back to congratulate Zoe but are attacked; Zoe breaks away and is stabbed in the stomach and then thrown over a balcony. As Amber and Lance make their way up to the balcony to find Zoe\'s corpse, P.J\'s dad, the sheriff, comes in and finds Amber covered in blood. He assumes they committed the murders, but is pulled into the darkness and hooked to death. Outside, Deputy Haffner, after saying that Roger told him about the accident, arrests Amber and Lance and escorts them to the back of his jeep; in the back lies Zoe\'s body. The Fisherman appears and makes his way towards Haffner, who fires several times, but the Fisherman does not budge and impales Haffner on a forklift. Amber and Lance get into the car and run the fisherman down, but he immediately gets up and takes his mask off, revealing the decomposed face of Ben Willis, the man who brutally committed the original murders 10 years ago. He then immediately disappears into thin air. Amber and Lance go to get help but are again attacked by Willis and are chased into a warehouse. They make it out and lure Willis into a thresher, which appears to kill him. A year later, Amber is driving across the desert, talking to Lance as a tire blows out. She stops in the middle of nowhere and waits while she talks to Lance. She stands in the middle of the road, and loses reception. Amber then begins looking around as the camera cycles around her, a flash of Ben Willis is seen behind Amber, the film then cuts to black screen as Amber\'s scream is cut off by the sling of the hook hearing the sound of blood splashing.'] ['Five strangers go with a tourist group to view old catacombs.

The title credit cites the work of Father Sebastien Michaelis as inspiration for the film. He wrote a book that listed the Hierarchy of Devils as revealed to him by a possessed nun."] ["The film's premise is that there is another way to heaven than adherence to the practices of the Roman Catholic Church. A secular Sin Eater can remove all taint of sin, no matter how foul, from the soul just before death. The purified soul can then ascend into heaven. The Roman Catholic Church, according to the film, considers this heresy. Heath Ledger plays an unhappy and disillusioned priest, Alex Bernier, a member of a fictitious religious order The Carolingians which specializes in fighting demons and other hell spawn. Father Dominic, the head of the Carolingians, has died in Rome under suspicious circumstances and Alex leaves the USA to investigate. In Rome, Alex visits the morgue and sees strange markings on Dominic's corpse. After some investigation, he comes across a book that explains the markings as being the sign of a Sin Eater's work. He heads to the Vatican, where an official tells him that Sin Eaters don't exist and that Dominic may not be buried on sacred ground because he had been excommunicated for his beliefs. Alex, moving ever farther from his vocation, defies his superiors and secretly reads a holy service over the body and buries Dominic in the Carolingian cemetery . Thomas Garrett, another Carolingian , arrives in Rome to help investigate Dominic's death. Early in the film we meet Mara Williams, an artist Alex once exorcised, who has escaped from a mental hospital and come to Alex at his church in the USA because she has a feeling that something terrible is going to happen to him. The police come looking for her, but Alex lies and denies that he's seen her and through this exchange we learn that Mara was in the hospital because she had tried to kill Alex during the exorcism. Mara goes to Rome with Alex after promising that she won't try to kill him again. Cardinal Driscoll , who is introduced at the beginning of the film and who is tipped to be the next Pope, arrives in Rome from the USA and gives Alex a special dagger. According to a fragment of parchment Alex and Thomas find among Dominic's books, the dagger is to be plunged into the Sin Eater while reciting a text in Aramaic. Alex and Thomas take these instructions to mean that the dagger and incantation will kill the Sin Eater and they begin hunting for the Sin Eater and the remainder of the parchment instructions. Thomas leads Alex to a nightclub where they are taken to the underground base of operations of a masked man called Chirac, the 'Black Pope.' The Black Pope owes a favor to Thomas and Alex asks where to find the Sin Eater. The Black Pope then hangs three people and tells Alex to ask his question of the dying men who can see what the living cannot. One of the dying tells Alex a riddle that leads to a rendezvous with the Sin Eater. On the way out of the Black Pope's headquarters, demons attack and injure Thomas, but Alex saves him and gets him to a hospital. Alex leaves Thomas in the hospital and meets the Sin Eater, William Eden, at St. Peter's Cathedral who explains that he has been a Sin Eater for centuries, taking over for an earlier Sin Eater  who ate the sins of Eden's brother. Eden is very charismatic and talks with Alex about the priest's desires, and Alex admits he wants Mara. He then goes and presumably tells Mara this, and they make love. Afterward, Alex leaves Mara asleep and goes to Eden, who tells Alex that he is tired and ready to die and asks Alex to take his place. Alex has the dagger with him, but is curious and so doesn't use it to kill Eden. Instead, he assists Eden with a sin eating ritual. But in the end, Alex refuses Eden's offer because he has decided to leave the priesthood to be with Mara. Later Alex returns to their lodgings and finds Mara near death, an apparent suicide. In actuality, Eden slit her wrists and left her for Alex to find. Mara is beyond medical help and Alex quickly performs the sin eating ritual so that she can go to heaven. After absorbing Mara's sins, though, Alex sees that there is no sin of suicide on Mara's conscience and realizes Eden's deception. Alex goes after Eden to kill him. The rationale that leads Alex to perform the sin eating ritual instead of giving Mara Roman Catholic Last Rites is that Alex has already made the decision to leave the priesthood to be with Mara and he has broken his vows of obedience and of sexual abstinence. He therefore considers himself ineligible to offer Mara Last Rites. Meanwhile, the injured Thomas is out of the hospital and goes to see the Black Pope who reveals himself to be Cardinal Driscoll. Driscoll shows Thomas the second half of the parchment which instead of being instructions on how to kill a Sin Eater is actually instructions on how to become a Sin Eater. The entirety of Alex's and Mara's lives have been a plot among Dominic, Eden and Driscoll to entrap Alex. Eden wants to die, Driscoll wants to be Pope and Dominic wanted the financial resources to pursue arcane knowledge. Driscoll prevents Thomas from leaving to warn Alex. Alex cannot find Eden and returns to the Black Pope to learn where Eden is. The Black Pope  tells Alex again to ask the dying. Alex recognizes that Thomas is the man being hanged, and frees him using a pistol. However, Thomas's throat is too injured by the noose to tell Alex the truth of the parchment. Alex finds Eden and stabs him with the dagger while reciting the incantation. He quickly realizes what is actually happening but it is too late, Eden's powers are transferred to Alex, and Eden, happy to be free of his burden of the sins of others, dies. In the mean time, St. Peter's Basilica in Rome crumbles around them. Thomas, who arrives at the scene too late to prevent the transfer, vows he will find a way to save Alex, even if it means killing him. Alex informs the church about Driscoll's activities and Driscoll is ruined. Driscoll then decides to kill himself and calls on the Sin Eater, now Alex, to remove his sins. Driscoll slits his wrists and when he is near death, Alex tells him that he knows that Eden and Driscoll caused Mara's death. Alex does not eat Driscoll's sins but forces them down Driscoll's throat. Driscoll dies a painful death and presumably goes straight to hell. The Sin Eater William Eden used his power to accumulate wealth. The Sin Eater Alex Bernier decides to act as a power for good, saving only those who deserve it and allowing evildoers to die in sin."] ['Elijah Price  is born with Type I osteogenesis imperfecta, a rare disease in which bones break easily. Drawing on what he has read in comic books during his many hospital stays, Price theorizes that if he is frail at one extreme, then perhaps there is someone strong at the opposite extreme. Years later, security guard David Dunn  is also searching for meaning in his life. He gave up a promising football career to marry his love Audrey ([[Robin Wright  after they were involved in an auto accident. However, their marriage is dissolving, to the distress of their young son Joseph . Returning from a job interview in New York, David is the sole survivor of a horrific train wreck that killed 131 passengers, sustaining no injuries himself. He is contacted by the adult Elijah, who proposes to a disbelieving David that he is a real instance of the kind of person after whom comic-book superheroes are modeled. David tries to ignore him, but Elijah stalks him and his wife, trying to get his attention. To relieve his family from further distress, David finally agrees to hear Elijah out, and begins to test himself. While lifting weights with Joseph, they discover that his physical strength is far beyond what he previously thought and Joseph begins to idolize his father and believe he is a superhero. Joseph confronts some bullies at school thinking he might share his dad\'s abilities, but is injured instead. David tries to console his son by saying that Elijah is wrong and that he\'s just as normal as everyone else. This encourages Joseph to take David\'s loaded pistol and point it at him saying that if shot, his father would not die. David manages to talk him out of the deed, not by saying he would die, but by threatening to pack up and leave for New York. Under Elijah\'s influence, David develops his security guard hunches into extra-sensory perception, with which he can glimpse immoral acts committed by people he touches. David\'s faith in Elijah is shaken when he remembers an incident from his childhood in which he almost drowned. However, Elijah suggests that the incident highlights his one weakness, water. This leads David to go to the train yard that houses the remnants of the train that crashed. Upon seeing the wreckage, David has a flashback of the car accident he and Audrey were in, it is revealed not only that he was unharmed, but that he had ripped a door off the car in order to save Audrey, a memory he had long repressed. It transpires that David used the excuse of the accident to quit football, because Audrey had a hatred of the sport and David knew that the only way their relationship could ever flourish would be to get football out of the picture. At Elijah\'s suggestion, he walks through a crowd in a Philadelphia train station and senses crimes perpetrated by strangers who brush past him: a jewel thief, a racist hate crime perpetrator, and a rapist. The worst offender is a sadistic janitor holding a family hostage and torturing them inside their home. On a rainy night, David follows the janitor back to the victims\' house. After freeing the children, he is ambushed by the lurking janitor who throws him off a balcony into a pool below, where he nearly drowns but is rescued by the children. He grapples with the janitor, ultimately strangling him. That night, he is reconciled with Audrey and the following morning, secretly shows the newspaper article of his anonymous heroic act to his son. David attends an exhibition at Elijah\'s comic book art gallery and meets Elijah\'s mother . After talking with Elijah in the back room of his studio, David shakes his hand and discovers to his horror that Elijah had orchestrated many of the fatal disasters he had mentioned, causing hundreds of deaths, the last being David\'s train accident. Elijah insists the deaths were justified as a means to find David. He explains that his purpose in life is to be the archvillain to David\'s hero, even going so far as to suggest that his childhood moniker, "Mr. Glass," should have alerted him to the fact that he was always a villain.'] ["Mark  returns home from an espionage mission  to find that his wife, Anna , wants a divorce. She won't say why, but insists it's not because she's found someone else. Though Mark would rather stay with Anna and work things out, he turns both the apartment and custody of their young son, Bob, over to her. Living alone, he begins to obsess over her, making dozens of calls, and seemingly going mad. He pays a visit to their flat only to find Bob alone, unkempt, and neglected. When Anna returns, he refuses to leave her alone with the child but attempts to make amends. He stays at the apartment to care for Bob but Anna leaves in the middle of the night. Mark receives a phone call from Anna’s lover, Heinrich , telling him that Anna is with him. He then gets Heinrich’s phone number from Anna’s friend, Margie. The next day, Mark meets Bob’s teacher, Helen . She looks exactly like Anna but with brilliant green eyes and where Anna is hysterical, Helen is calm and kind. Mark pays a visit to Heinrich who swears he didn’t call, telling Mark that Anna needed space; he has not seen her, having been away on a business trip himself. Mark attacks Heinrich, who defends himself and leaves Mark bloodied. Mark returns home to find Anna who, when confronted, is vague on her whereabouts. He beats her and she storms out. He follows, apologizing, attempting a reconciliation. She leaves him on the street. On his way back to the flat, he encounters Margie, whose left leg is inexplicably in a cast, and he tells her, “I loathe you” when she offers to look after Bob. Mark meets with a private investigator whom he hires to follow Anna, then returns to the flat where he and Margie embrace in the bedroom. The next day, Mark and Anna have another extreme argument during which she cuts her own neck with an electric knife. Mark tends the wound and then sits, forlornly in the kitchen, cutting his own arm with the knife. She leaves again – going off to her mysterious place, her neck bandaged. Following Anna around the city, the private investigator discovers Anna in a squalid, nearly empty apartment. The investigator pretends to be a building manager and inspects the apartment. In the bathroom, he finds a creature of such bizarre proportions that he is stunned into silence. Anna kills him with the end of a broken bottle. Meanwhile, Mark begins a relationship with Helen. When she stays the night, Bob is awakened by nightmares, crying out for his mother. Helen apologizes and leaves saying she should not have attempted to replace Anna. Zimmerman, the lover of the missing private detective, approaches Mark to inquire about his whereabouts. Mark gives him the address of Anna’s mysterious apartment, which was presumably given to him by the detective. When Zimmerman goes to Anna’s apartment, he discovers the freakish creature as well as his dead lover’s body. Anna proclaims that the creature, “Is very tired. He made love to me all night,” and “He’s still unfinished, you know.” She then violently beats Zimmerman when he attempts to shoot her, takes his gun and kills him. Anna, returning to the flat she shares with Mark, continues her erratic behavior, putting clothes in the refrigerator and food in the bedroom. She then tells Mark about her miscarriage. In a flashback, Anna, on her way home from market, has what appears to be a seizure of epic violence as she walks through the subway, ending with her on the floor of the passageway, oozing blood and fluids from every orifice. She tells Mark, “What I miscarried there was sister faith and what was left was sister chance.” She leaves him again and Mark calls Heinrich, giving him Anna’s address. Heinrich attempts to make love to her but finds the creature, still monstrous but more developed, in her bedroom. Anna then reveals the grim fruits of her endeavors: a collection of body parts in her refrigerator, presumably those of the dead detective and Zimmerman. She attacks Heinrich with a knife and he flees, bleeding. Anna, meanwhile, prepares to make love to the creature. Heinrich telephones Mark and asks to meet him at a bar, telling him what he has seen. Mark goes to the apartment and discovers the remains of the detective and his lover; he destroys the apartment by igniting the gas stove and blowing it up. When Mark arrives at the bar he murders Heinrich in the bathroom, making it look as if he drowned in his own vomit. Upon returning to the flat, Mark finds Margie outside with her throat cut, possibly at Anna’s hand. He brings the body back into the flat where Anna waits. She greets him tenderly, cleans him up and makes love to him in the kitchen. He lays out a plan for them to cover up the problem and, as Bob awakens to find them together, she flees. Heinrich’s mother phones Mark looking for her son. She tells Mark that Heinrich’s body was discovered but that she did not identify it because it was only his body, “his soul was not there.” Mark, who has continued to cover for Anna, finds her at the apartment where the creature, considerably more evolved, copulates with her on the bed. As the creature penetrates her she repeats over and over, “Almost.” Mark meets Heinrich’s mother in person and she claims that she “must be with him.” She then seemingly poisons herself and dies. Mark, later wandering the street, meets up with his former business associates who insist that he do business with them again. Mark appears to refuse and later, while being followed by police, murders an officer then flees on a motorcycle. He has a horrific accident and races into a building where he is pursued by Anna, the police and his business associates. Anna tells him, “I wanted to find you. It is finished now,” and reveals the creature, now fully formed as Mark’s doppelganger. Mark raises his gun to shoot it but he and Anna are gunned down by a hail of bullets from below. The doppelganger remains impervious. Anna uses Mark’s gun to shoot herself and dies in his arms. He jumps to his death through the stairwell. The doppelganger, meanwhile, enlists the help of a woman who resembles Margie, standing at the top of the stairs. The doppelganger flees through the roof. Later, Helen is at the flat with Bob when the doorbell rings. Bob repeats over and over, “Don’t open,” but Helen ignores his plea. She goes to the door as the sounds of sirens, planes and explosions fill the air. Bob races through the flat, ending in the bathroom where he jumps face down into a bathtub full of water and floats as if dead. Meanwhile, Helen, listening to the sirens and planes as if in fear, seems unaware of the doppelganger which can be seen through the glass door. Her expression changes to something indeterminate as light from the explosions illuminates her brilliant, green eyes."] ['Throughout the film, a disembodied voice of a woman is heard; she express her fears through a monologue, making confessions from trivial anxiety, grotesque nightmares, to crippling sadness. # The first story is a traditional animation written and directed by Blutch.

They befriend their neighbour, Jud Crandall, who tells them about a nearby pet cemetery which was built on Indian burial grounds and is rumored to be haunted. Later, Louis Creed, working at the University of Maine at Orono health center, treats Victor Pascow, who has been hit by a truck and incurred massive head injuries. Pascow dies after grabbing Louis, addressing him by name, and uttering a cryptic message. He also promises to "come to" him. That night, in what is seemingly a dream, Victor visits Louis, warning him about the burial ground beyond the pet cemetery. Louis wakes up to find his feet covered in dirt.

This is the Belasco House: the "Mount Everest of haunted houses," originally owned by the notorious "Roaring Giant" Emeric Belasco, a six-foot-five perverted millionaire and supposed murderer, who disappeared soon after a massacre at his home. The house is believed to be haunted by numerous spirits, the victims of Belasco\'s twisted and sadistic desires. Accompanying Barrett are his wife, Edith, as well as two mediums: a mental medium and Spiritualist minister, Florence Tanner, and a physical medium, Ben Fischer, who is also the sole survivor of an earlier investigation. The rationalist Barrett is rudely skeptical of Tanner\'s Christian faith and spiritual beliefs, asserting that there is nothing but unfocused electromagnetic energy in the house. Barrett brings a machine he has developed, which he believes will rid the house of any paranormal presence or force. Though not a physical medium, Tanner begins to manifest physical phenomena inside the house. When, after a quarrel with Tanner, Barrett is attacked by invisible forces, he suspects that Tanner may be using the house\'s energy against him. Meanwhile Fischer remains aloof, with his mind closed to the house\'s influence, and is only there to collect the generous pay offered him to return. Edith Barrett is subjected to erotic visions late at night, which seem linked to her lackluster sex life. She goes downstairs and, in a seeming trance, disrobes and demands sex from Fischer. He instead strikes her, snapping her out of the trance, and she returns to herself, horrified and ashamed. A second incident occurs a day or so later ; her husband arrives a moment later to witness her advances to Fischer and is resentful, stating to Fischer\'s face that he believes that Fischer no longer has any psychic ability and that "Mr. Deutsch is wasting one-third of his money!" Stricken by the accusation, Fischer finally drops his psychic shields but is immediately attacked. Tanner, convinced that one of the "surviving personalities" is Belasco\'s tormented son Daniel and determined to prove it at all costs, finds a human skeleton chained behind a wall. Believing it to be Daniel, Tanner and Fischer bury the body outside the house and Tanner performs a funeral. Despite this, Daniel\'s personality continues to haunt Tanner; she is scratched violently by a possessed cat and Barrett, seeing the scratches, suspects that Tanner may be mutilating herself. In an attempt to put the supposed Daniel to rest, Tanner gives herself to the entity sexually, and later appears to be possessed herself, temporarily. Barrett\'s machine is assembled. Tanner attempts to destroy it, thinking that it will harm the spirits in the house, but is prevented. She enters the chapel, the unholy heart of the house, in an attempt to warn the spirits, and is crushed by a falling crucifix.  Barrett meanwhile activates his machine, which seems to be effective. Finally activating his psychic abilities as he wanders in the house, Fischer declares the place "completely clear!" in astonishment. However, soon afterwards, violent psychic activity resumes and Barrett is killed. Fischer decides finally to confront the house, with Edith accompanying him despite her misgivings. In the chapel, a confrontation ensues: thanks to clues from the manner in which Tanner, Barrett and the previous investigators had died, Fischer deduces that Belasco is the sole entity haunting the house, masquerading as many. He taunts Belasco, declaring him a "son of a whore", and that he was no "roaring giant", but likely a "funny little dried-up bastard" who fooled everyone about his alleged height. Even as objects begin to hurl themselves at Fischer, he continues to defy the entity, until all becomes still, and a portion of the chapel wall shatters, revealing a hidden door. Going inside, Fischer and Edith discover a lead-lined room, containing Belasco\'s preserved body seated in a chair. Pulling out a pocketknife, Fischer rips open Belasco\'s trouser leg, discovering his final secret: a pair of prosthetic legs. Fischer and Edith realize Belasco had had his own stunted legs amputated, and used the prosthetics in a grotesque attempt to appear imposing. Belasco had the lead lined room specially built , in the event of his death, to preserve his spirit, afraid of what may happen otherwise. With the room now open, Fischer activates Barrett\'s machine a second time, and he and Edith leave the house, expressing hopes that Barrett and Tanner will guide Belasco to the afterlife without fear.'] ['At the start of the film, the US Government has ordered a branch of the US Military to discontinue tests concerning "the C.H.U.D. project", which is built around the idea that enzymes taken from the sewer dwelling creatures from C.H.U.D. can make hyper-effective killing machines in the army.

Not recognizing the tone, Yoko doesn\'t pick up soon enough and the call goes into "voice mail" . When she sees that the call/message was from her own phone number and dated two days into the future, both she and her friend Nakamura Yumi  listen intently to the message. What they hear is the voice of Yoko in casual chit-chat, followed by a horrendous scream and then dead silence, which visibly disturbs Yoko and Yumi. The two girls attempt to laugh the message off and even share the story with their friends, who are just as clueless as them. She tells her friends that she received the call to her cell phone on Apr 16 at 11:04 p.m. Her cell phone indicated that the message was from Apr 18 at 11:04 p.m. At exactly 11:04 p.m. on April 18, Yumi receives a call from Yoko. During that call, Yoko goes through the very same chit-chat as was on her previous voice mail. As Yumi suddenly realizes what might happen next, she hears Yoko shriek into the phone. Suddenly, Yoko is then violently thrown by an invisible force through a chain link fence and onto a speeding commuter train down below just passing by, decapitating her. Then, as Yoko\'s severed arm still holds the phone, the finger suddenly begins to dial a randomly picked phone number, and she also vomits a strange red candy. Kawai Kenji\'s  phone is next to receive a call and, like Yoko, misses it. He receives a voice message with himself cursing and then a loud scream, Yumi is with him and hears it too. Kenji saw a friend that he had to meet with and he said the same words of the message and then the doors of the elevator opened without the cabin, and as they but looked on, he was pulled into the shaft and plummets with the same screams of the message. He falls to his death at the bottom of the elevator and he vomits a red candy. His phone is still working on its own looking for another victim to kill. Konichi Natsumi  is at Yumi\'s house and her phone rings with a strange video of her and a body behind her. She then goes to a TV program for an exorcism. Yumi meets Hirochi Yamashita and with the help of him they go to the TV program. The exorcism is a complete disaster and the video of Natsumi becomes real. Yumi and Yamashita came to save Natsumi, but when they get to Natsumi her right hand turns to the back, her complete arm turns to the back of her neck and turns until her head falls off. Her decapitated body still walks and eventually falls down on the floor. A red candy comes out of her mouth that stops at Yumi\'s feet and the chilling ring tone sounds on Yumi\'s phone. Yumi and Yamashita investigate the phone calls in an old hospital and they find a dead body of a woman with a phone that comes to life. The body is of Marie Mizunuma , the mother of Mimiko  and Nanako, who they believe to be the killer ghost. The body comes to life when Yumi lays eyes upon it and begins to advance towards Yumi. Yamashita comes to the aid of Yumi but they are separated on either side of a door by the same force that killed Yoko, leaving Yumi trapped in the room with the ghost-corpse of Mizunuma and Yamashita helplessly looking on through a barred window at the side of the door. The ghost-corpse comes for Yumi and comes to strangle her to death. Yumi apologizes to Marie, crying and saying she will never leave her mother again, with Marie believing Yumi is her daughter. After the incident the police have arrived and have seen to Yumi and Yamashita. An investigator talks to the pair and insists that Yamashita come to the orphanage where Mimiko and Nanako dwelt, for they have discovered some important evidence they need him to see. In Yumi\'s apartment she is haunted by Mimiko and Yamashita comes to save her, but Yumi stabs Yamashita in the stomach. As Yamashita collapses onto the floor he sees that instead of Yumi\'s reflection in nearby mirror, it\'s Mimiko, who turns to look at him, indicating that Mimiko has possessed Yumi. The vision of Mimiko says that she\'ll take him to the hospital, much as she did for her sister while she was alive. Later, Yamashita wakes up in the hospital with Yumi in the room with a knife hiding behind her back. It turns out that Mimiko, not Marie, was abusing Nanako all along. She leans forward and gives him the same kind of red candy that appeared with all of the victims, then waits. When Yamashita seems to enjoy the candy, Yumi smiles, and the spirit of Mimiko has obviously found another person to "take care of" as she did with her little sister. The film ends with the song Ikutsuka no Sora by Kou Shibasaki.'] ["Widowed David  and his daughter Emily , with whom he shares a troubled relationship, move after Emily's mother, Allison , commits suicide.

A judge issued a restraining order barring them from investigating the supernatural, forcing them out of business. Ray Stantz owns an occult bookstore and co-operates with Winston Zeddemore as unpopular children\'s entertainers, wearing their old Ghostbuster uniforms; Egon Spengler works in a laboratory at Columbia University conducting experiments into human emotion; Peter Venkman hosts a little-watched pseudo-psychic television show named "World of the Psychic"; and Dana Barrett, having broken up with Peter years earlier, and now divorced from a subsequent marriage, works at the Manhattan Museum of Art restoring paintings and raising her infant son Oscar at a new apartment. After an incident in which Oscar\'s baby carriage is controlled by an unseen supernatural force and drawn to a busy junction on First Avenue, Dana turns to the Ghostbusters for help, prompting an awkward reunion of herself and Peter. Meanwhile, Dr. Janosz Poha &mdash; Dana\'s colleague at the art gallery &mdash; is brainwashed by the spirit of Vigo the Carpathian, a seventeenth-century tyrant trapped in a painting in the gallery. Vigo orders Janosz to locate a child that Vigo can possess, thus gaining physical form upon the approaching New Year. The Ghostbusters\' investigation leads them to conclude that the supernatural presence originates from under the city streets, prompting them to illegally excavate First Avenue at the point where the baby carriage stopped. Lowered underneath, Ray discovers a river of pink slime filling an abandoned subway line. Attacked by the slime after obtaining a sample, Ray accidentally causes a blackout, and the Ghostbusters are arrested. At their trial they are defended poorly by Louis Tully  and found guilty. However, the judge\'s angry outburst at sentencing prompts the slime sample presented as evidence to release the ghosts of two murdering brothers whom the judge had previously sentenced to death by electric chair. Thereafter the Ghostbusters imprison the ghosts in exchange for the dismissal of all charges and the rescinding of the restraining order; having done so, they recommence their Ghostbusting business, busier than ever. After the slime invades Dana\'s apartment, seemingly to abduct Oscar, she seeks refuge with Peter, and the two begin to renew their relationship. Investigating the slime and the history of the painting of Vigo, the Ghostbusters discover that the slime reacts both to positive and negative emotions and even "dances" to music, but suspect that it has been generated by the bad attitudes of New Yorkers. While Peter and Dana have dinner together and Louis and Janine attend to Oscar , Egon, Ray, and Winston explore the underground river of slime. While measuring the depth, Winston gets pulled into the flowing river, giving Ray and Egon no choice but to jump in after him. When they escape back to the surface  Ray and Winston begin arguing, but Egon realizes it is because they are drenched in negatively-charged slime. In only their long undergarments and dripping in slime Egon, Ray, and Winston go to the restaurant where Peter and Dana are eating, talking loudly and causing a major disturbance. Egon, Ray, and Winston are carried out of the restaurant by police. The Ghostbusters go to the mayor with their suspicions, but are dismissed; whereupon his scheming assistant Jack attempts to have them committed to a psychiatric hospital to protect the mayor\'s interests. As they are committed, a spirit resembling a Mary Poppins-like version of Janosz kidnaps Oscar from Peter\'s apartment, prompting Dana to break into the museum by herself; whereupon the museum is covered by impenetrable slime. New Year\'s Eve sees a sudden increase of supernatural activity as the slime, rapidly increasing in volume in the subway line, rises through the ground and onto the surface of the city, causing a demon to invade Washington Square Park; a fur coat returning to life to attack its owner; a film monster bursting out of a movie screen at a cinema; and the arrival of the Titanic and its long-deceased passengers and crew in the harbor. Realizing the truth of the situation after having spent the night talking to the ghost of former mayor Fiorello La Guardia, the present mayor fires Jack and has the Ghostbusters released, whereupon they approach the museum. Their initial attempts to enter are unsuccessful, the wave of negativity that has generated it proving too powerful to penetrate it with their proton packs. Determining that they need a symbol of equally-powerful positivity to break through the slime, the Ghostbusters use positively-charged mood slime from their slime blowers, an adapted NES Advantage Controller, and a remix of "Higher and Higher" to animate the Statue of Liberty and pilot it through the streets of New York, using its torch to break through the museum\'s ceiling to attack Vigo and Janosz. Janosz is easily defeated by being sprayed with positively-charged slime; but Vigo immobilizes the Ghostbusters and attempts a transfer into Oscar\'s body, whereupon a chorus of "Auld Lang Syne" from outside the building weakens him sufficiently to free the Ghostbusters and return him to the painting. Vigo momentarily possesses Ray; whereupon the other Ghostbusters attack him with a combination of proton streams and positively-charged mood slime. Dressed in full Ghostbusters attire, Louis  attacks the weakened slime barrier around the building with a proton stream of his own. This combination destroys Vigo and changes the painting to a likeness of the four Ghostbusters surrounding baby Oscar. The movie ends with the Ghostbusters receiving a standing ovation from the crowd and, at a later ceremony to restore the Statue, the Key to the City from the mayor.'] ['At an archaeological dig in Northern Iraq, archaeologist Father Lankester Merrin  visits a site where a silver Roman Catholic medallion along with a small stone amulet resembling a grimacing, bestial creature are found buried together.

Matilda gave them gifts and gold coins when they lost a tooth, thus earning her the name "Tooth Fairy." After a fire in her home left her horribly disfigured with an extreme sensitivity to light, she wore a porcelain mask, and only went out at night. Although the children adored Matilda, the adults were suspicious of her and one day, when two children went missing, the townspeople quickly blamed Matilda and hanged her, ripping off her porcelain mask and exposing her face to the light. Out of anger and betrayal, Matilda promised her vengeance. Soon afterward, the two missing children returned home unharmed. The town, realizing their mistake, quickly buried Matilda\'s body along with their secret. The story of Matilda Dixon, the Tooth Fairy, is told to many generations after the murder, and it is believed that her spirit visits children on the night they lose their last baby tooth, where she seeks her vengeance if they see her. The story begins when Kyle Walsh, an antisocial teenager, befriended only by his secret infatuation, Caitlin Greene, loses his last baby tooth. He soon realizes that the story of Matilda Dixon is not just a fable when he sees her in his room. Realizing that light is her weakness, he shines a flashlight into her face and hides in the bright lights of the bathroom. His mother, in trying to convince him there\'s nothing in his room, is killed after seeing the Tooth Fairy. The next morning, as the police arrive, Kyle is taken to a mental hospital after speculations that he himself killed his mother. Twelve years later, Caitlin Greene calls a secluded Kyle to ask for his help with her younger brother, Michael, who refuses to sleep in the dark. After a visit to the hospital to talk to Michael - with his bag of flashlights, his "peace of mind" - Kyle soon realizes that Michael has had an encounter with the Tooth Fairy. Michael, like Kyle, now has a gripping fear of the dark, and is thought to have gone insane. Afraid of the truth, Kyle at first denies any relation to his condition, and walks away from Caitlin. United with his childhood neighbors, Kyle attempts to warn others of the Tooth Fairy and tells them to stay in the light. The ridicule that he faces leads to the death of many townspeople. He soon gains allies as they realize the truth within his story. To add to the terror, a storm causes a disturbance in the power grid for the town, just as Kyle loses his bag of flashlights to the police when he is arrested and questioned about the sudden rise in the death toll. After convincing the police that his story is true, Kyle, Michael and Caitlin decide to lead the Tooth Fairy to the largest source of light in the town - the lighthouse. They are assisted by several medical personnel, all of whom are killed by the Tooth Fairy on the way. In an attempt to destroy her, Kyle truly faces the demon as he rips off her porcelain mask and ignites her. This fate is tested when another young child loses his last baby tooth and awaits the Tooth Fairy, only to find, to the audience\'s knowledge, that his mother replaces the tooth with a gold coin, indicating that the story is over and the tooth fairy has been destroyed forever.'] ['A spoiled, teenage girl named Debbie is the center of the plot.HORROR MOVIES & STUFF REVIEW Complications arise when three criminals seek shelter, but they are unaware of the beast that lurks in the attic.Aunt Rose  - Movie Info - Yahoo!

Back in a hotel room, her lover Didier  looks over the balcony and witnesses the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami coming onshore. It hits as Marie watches from a distance. She runs away from the shore while trying to save a little girl, but they are both quickly swallowed by the wave. Pulled lifeless from the water, she is resuscitated by rescuers, but is left for dead. She gasps back to life after having a near-death experience in which she sees a vision of human figures inhabiting a realm of light, among them the silhouettes of the girl, whom she wasn\'t able to save, and her mother holding hands. Marie and Didier manage to reunite in the aftermath of the disaster. Marie returns with Didier to Paris. Her experience, however, interferes with her work, pressuring her and exausting her to the point that Didier, who is also her producer and supervisor, sends her on a leave of absence to write the book they\'ve discussed, which would add to her business prestige. Marie sells her idea of a new book and receives complete backing for the book. She celebrates by going to dinner and asks Didier what he thinks happens when they die. He answers that it\'s "lights out" and nothing else. Marie believes that there may be a hereafter where there is life on the other side. Now writing a book and with more time to contemplate her near-death experience, Marie travels to Switzerland to meet a renowned specialist in the field.

Having been in talks with a publisher before her trip to Thailand about a biography of François Mitterrand, Marie now stuns them with her new manuscript entitled "Hereafter: A Conspiracy of Silence". The publisher rejects the manuscript, insisting that his company only publishes books with political themes and that her switching the content is unacceptable. Marie leaves her office humiliated.

In San Francisco, former professional psychic George Lonegan  is persuaded against his wishes to perform a reading for Christos , a wealthy client of his brother Billy . A genuine medium with a gift for communicating with the dead, George abandoned his old career because he was unable to deal with the emotional impact of the reunions and the often disturbingly intimate family secrets revealed in front of him. While doing the reading, George hears the word June and asks if a date in June means anything to him. Christos at first denies that it means anything, but privately reveals to Billy that June was the name of his late wife\'s nurse, with whom he was in love for 10 years. Afterwards, Billy pressures George to get back into the business of doing readings; he insists that George has a "gift" and an obligation to help people. George explains that his "gift" is actually a curse, and that the process is extremely painful for him and the people around him. George enrolls in a cooking class taught by one of San Francisco\'s leading chefs. Its students are paired-up, resulting in George being partnered with a young woman named Melanie . The two soon hit it off. He is returning to his apartment when confronted by a neighbor of Christos who begs for him to perform a psychic reading in order to talk to her baby again. He refuses. After attending their second class, George and Melanie decide to put their new culinary skills to use by preparing an Italian dinner at George\'s place. All goes well until they hear an ill-timed phone message from his brother, which inclines George to reveal his past as a psychic to Melanie. He explains how he fell ill as a child and that during surgery to save him, he suffered brain damage which left him with migraines and the psychic ability, which doctors diagnosed as a form of schizophrenia. He has medication to stop the visions, but does not take it because it robs him of the ability to feel anything. Curious, she presses George to do a reading for her. George explains his reluctance, since he knows it will destroy any chance for a relationship between them. Melanie is insistent, however, and George acquiesces. They contact the spirit of Melanie\'s mother. During the first cooking class together, George receives a vision from Melanie when he accidentally touched her. He now reveals it was her father, who was asking her forgiveness for what he did to her as a child. Melanie flees George\'s home in tears. Saddened, George toys with the idea of taking the medication but instead just deals with his sadness and difficulty with sleeping by listening to audiobook versions of Charles Dickens novels as read by Derek Jacobi. George is laid off from his factory job, and is persuaded by Billy to revive his psychic practice. At the next cooking class, Melanie does not show up.  In London, 12-year-old twins Marcus and Jason  try desperately to prevent social services from taking them away from their dysfunctional and single mother, Jackie , a heavy heroin addict.

On the way home, Jason is attacked by street thugs, and while trying to escape, he is hit by a van and killed, with Marcus shockingly watching the death of his brother. No longer able to protect his mother, and barely able to cope with life without the brother he idolizes, Marcus is sent to a foster home, away from his mother. In his new foster family, Marcus refuses to speak to anyone. He is distant at school and barely does much of anything. He becomes hopeful that there is some way to talk to his brother again. Desperate for one last reunion with his twin brother, Marcus steals money from his foster parents and goes around London seeking psychics to help him contact Jason. Most of the mediums he encounters are either outright frauds or their methods don\'t work. While he is trying to board the underground at Charing Cross, Jason\'s cap, which has become a talisman for Marcus, blows off his head. Delayed by trying to find the cap, he misses his train and sees it explode in the tunnel during the 2005 London Bombings.  Still convinced that his ability is a curse, George abandons Billy and his plans for a psychic business and leaves San Francisco for London. There, he visits the Dickens House and learns of a live reading of Dickens by Derek Jacobi that same day at the London Book Fair. While there, he meets Marie who is at the fair promoting and signing her book. While handing a signed copy of her book to George, their hands touch and George has a psychic flash of Marie\'s near-death experience. Marcus and his foster parents are also at the London Book Fair to meet their previous foster son, who is there in his new job as a security guard. While there, Marcus spots George whom he remembered back from when he was searching for psychics online. Marcus attempts to speak with George, who brushes him off and returns to his hotel. Undeterred, Marcus follows him back and stands vigil outside his window until George eventually agrees to do his reading. Through George, Jason tells Marcus that he is happy in the afterlife. He instructs Marcus to stop wearing his cap and says that is why he knocked it off his head at the train station, which had the side effect of saving him from the bomb. Jason tells Marcus he must now stand on his own but not to fear this "because we are one". Marcus later visits his mother in a rehabilitation center. She is visibly better, and he is not wearing Jason\'s cap. As compensation for helping him, Marcus lets George know where Marie is staying. George visits the hotel and leaves an anonymous note for Marie, saying he believes her book to be true. She decides to join the anonymous fan for lunch and discovers George. While she is looking for him, George sees a vision of them kissing and holding hands, with the curse/gift gone, and George with some kind of a normal life. The film ends with the two just sitting down to talk close to where George imagined them kissing.'] ['In New York City, a sniper perched on a water tower opens fire on the crowded streets below, killing fifteen pedestrians.

Wealthy book collector Boris Balkan hires Corso to compare his recently acquired copy of the book The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows, by seventeenth-century author Aristide Torchia, to the other two known to be in existence. Balkan informs Corso that only one is genuine and is reputedly a version whose author was the devil himself. The book contains nine engravings that, when correctly interpreted and the legends properly spoken, will summon the Devil. Balkan suspects that his book might be a forgery and asks Corso to travel to Europe to determine whether his is genuine and to acquire the others for Balkan—at any cost and by any means. Balkan\'s copy of The Nine Gates had previously belonged to bibliophile Andrew Telfer, who committed suicide soon after selling the book to Balkan. Moreover, Telfer\'s widow Liana wants the book back, as Telfer originally bought the book for her. Liana seduces Corso, but she fails to re-acquire her book. Meanwhile, Corso\'s business partner and rare-book shop owner, Bernie, whom Corso had asked to hide the book, is murdered, and his corpse is posed to reflect one of the engravings in The Nine Gates, which, as in the image of The Hanged Man Tarot card, shows a man suspended by one foot upside down. Corso travels to Toledo, Spain, to talk with the Ceniza brothers, both twins played by José López Rodero, book restorers who point out to him three of the book\'s engravings signed "LCF", which, with their prompting, Corso understands means that Lucifer himself designed and cut them. Corso next goes by train to Sintra, Portugal, and visits Victor Fargas, whose copy of The Nine Gates Corso compares with Balkan\'s. To his surprise, Corso discovers that the signature "LCF" is found in three different engravings in the Fargas copy, which vary in detail from their counterparts in the Balkan copy. The next morning a mysterious young woman, who has crossed paths with Corso since Balkan summoned him for this assignment, awakens Corso and leads him back to Fargas\' house where he finds the old man murdered and the engravings ripped out of his copy of The Nine Gates. In Paris, Corso visits the Baroness Kessler, an owner of the third copy of the book. The Baroness initially refuses any contact with Corso once she realizes who his employer is, but Corso returns and intrigues Kessler—a lifelong devotee of the study of the book—with evidence that the engravings differ across the three copies. Having gained access to Kessler\'s copy, he records three further differences. Later, Kessler is killed, and the Girl displays supernatural abilities in rescuing Corso from Liana\'s bodyguard. Now believing that each copy of The Nine Gates is genuine, Corso suspects that the secret is a combination of the "LCF" versions of each of the nine engravings, distributed across all three copies of the book. Liana steals Balkan\'s copy from Corso\'s hotel room; he follows her to a mansion and witnesses her using it in leading a Satanist ceremony. Balkan suddenly interrupts the ceremony, kills Liana, takes the engraving pages and his own intact copy, and then flees. Corso pursues Balkan to a remote castle, which was depicted in one of the engravings, and in a postcard that Corso found in Kessler\'s copy, and finds Balkan preparing to open the nine gates. After a struggle, Balkan manages to trap Corso in a hole in the floor, thus immobilizing him and allowing Balkan to perform his summoning ritual unmolested—but with Corso as a \'witness\'. Balkan recites a series of phrases related to each of the nine engravings, then douses the floor and himself with gasoline and sets it alight, believing himself to be immune to the flames. Balkan\'s invocation, however, appears to fail, and Balkan begins screaming in agony as his body starts to burn. Corso frees himself and, with Balkan engulfed in flames, puts Balkan out of his agony with a shot and escapes the fire.  Outside the building, the Girl appears to Corso, and they consummate their attraction by the light of the flames. She tells him that Balkan failed because the ninth engraving Balkan had used was a forgery. Corso, following her directions, returns to the Ceniza brothers\' shop. Upon arriving, he finds the store gone and the last piece of furniture being removed, from the top of which falls the authentic ninth engraving, which includes a likeness of the mystery girl. With the last engraving in hand, Corso returns to the castle it depicts, and crosses the threshold of the Ninth Gate.'] ['The film tells the story of two journalists investigating the mysterious death of a woman who got in the 20s to discover the source of eternal life using some rare books stored inside the National Library.

After wandering around amidst fog and lifeless mummified bodies, the two go blind and fade into oblivion."] ['In 1987, Sarah Campbell  is driving her son Matthew  home from the hospital where he has been undergoing cancer treatments. The trips are frequent and long, and they have to stop often, as Matt gets sick. Sarah and her husband Peter , a recovering alcoholic, discuss finding a rental house closer to the hospital. On another hospital visit, Sarah finds a man putting up a “For Rent” sign in front of a large house. The man offers to sell her the house, noting that it has a bit of history, as it was formerly a funeral home. On the trip home, Matt is in extreme pain, so Sarah drives back to the house, where they stay for the night. Matt sees his reflection become distorted, and sees a figure in the reflection of his T.V. The following day, Peter arrives with Matt’s brother Billy  and cousins Wendy  and Mary , and they choose rooms. Matt chooses the basement, which also has a mysterious door, later discovered to lead to the old morgue room. After moving into the house, Matt suffers a series of visions involving an old, bearded man and corpses with symbols carved into their skin. He also sees strange creatures and appears to his family to be having blackouts. At the hospital, Matt confesses that he’s been seeing things to another patient, Reverend Nicholas Popescu . Nicholas tells Matt to call him if he needs to talk. After another vision, Matt calls Nicholas and tells him about the visions. Nicholas advises him to find out what the spirit wants. Later, Matt finds a burned figure in his room. He asks the spirit what it wants from him and the ghost begins to move towards him. When the rest of the family comes home, they find that all of the furniture has been stacked in the middle of the front room and Matt shirtless with his fingers bloody from scratching at the wall. The family begins to crack under the stress of Matt’s illness and bizarre behavior. Meanwhile, the children find a metal box of photographs, which show Jonah, a young man from Matt’s visions, at a séance, emitting ectoplasm. Wendy suggests the house may be haunted and she and Matt research its history. They find out that the funeral home was run by a man named Aickman, the sinister bearded man from Matt’s visions. Aickman also conducted psychic research and would host séances with Jonah as the medium. At one séance, all those attending, including Aickman, were found dead and Jonah disappeared. Later in the 1950s, the state was building a new road that would run through part of the cemetery near the house, and when the coffins were exhumed, it was discovered that many of the bodies had disappeared and were never buried. Matt and Wendy then contact Nicholas to seek his help. Nicholas finds a smaller box containing eyelids that Aickman cut off of the corpses, and theorizes that Aickman was practicing necromancy in an attempt to control the dead and bind them to the house. He realizes that Aickman did this in an attempt to magnify Jonah’s medium abilities. He asks Matt and Wendy to take his hands and pray with him for the souls of the missing bodies and for Jonah. When Matt takes their hands, he is drawn into a vision of that final séance. He watches as Jonah begins to painfully emit the ectoplasm from his mouth. He is broken from the vision when Sarah comes home. That night, both Wendy and Sarah suffer visions of spirits. Peter arrives in a drunken state, and begins shouting at everyone for having the lights on, causing a frightening racket. Sarah confronts him shortly after, and warns him not to come home if he drinks again. When the family goes to sleep, all of the electronics in the house go haywire, terrifying them. In desperation, Sarah contacts Nicholas. Nicholas finds human remains in the house and removes them, after which the activity stops. Matt later awakens to find Aikman’s symbols carved into his flesh. He is taken to the hospital, where he encounters Jonah. Meanwhile, Nicholas nearly crashes his car when Jonah appears in his backseat. He and Matt begin to have simultaneous visions, in which Jonah is shown years before. After emitting the ectoplasm, Jonah’s entire family is burnt to a degree, after a flash of bright light. After angering a demonic presence, Jonah flees, only to have the spirit affect everything in the home. Seemingly the only way out, Jonah uses a dumbwaiter to escape, calling for help. Entering an unknown chamber, Jonah realizes that he has entered the home furnace. Quickly before escaping, the spirit traps Jonah in the furnace, and burns him alive, unknown to his father. Matt and Nicholas then break from the vision, after which Jonah’s spirit disappears. Peter and Sarah meet at the hospital and learn that Matt’s cancer treatments have had no effect. They then discover that Matt has escaped the hospital. Back at the house, Wendy discovers all the food in the house has suddenly turned rotten. She takes a shower, while Nicholas leaves a message telling the family to get out of the house immediately – Jonah’s spirit was actually protecting them from the spirits. Wendy is nearly suffocated by the shower curtain, but escapes, only to see Matt arrive with an axe. Matt breaks through the walls in the front room with the axe, revealing the dusty corpses Aickman hid in the walls. He forces Wendy and the children out of the house, barricading himself inside and tearing down the other walls, as marked corpses begin to tumble into the room. As he swings the axe, the view switches from Matt to Jonah, who seems to be occupying Matt’s body. Matt lights the bodies and the room on fire, then crouches in pain in the middle of the room, as the bound spirits surround him. Sarah, Peter and Nicholas arrive with the fire department, Sarah and Peter frantically trying to get in to save Matt. Sarah gets into the house and takes Matt under a table to avoid the falling timbers. The spirits finally disappear, seemingly freed, as a firefighter breaks through and pulls Matt and Sarah to safety. Outside, everyone watches tearfully as the emergency crew attempts to resuscitate a dying Matt. As Matt slips away, he has a vision of himself standing in the graveyard where he sees Jonah, no longer appearing burnt. He seems about to follow Jonah when he hears his mother’s voice. He returns to his body and Jonah’s spirit leaves him, appearing next to Nicholas before finally vanishing, as he can now move on. At the end of the film, we are told that Matt’s cancer has disappeared, and the house was rebuilt and resold with no further reported incidents of haunting.'] ['Ben Garvey is a reformed criminal on parole and he lives with his wife and fathers his young daughter.

On the slopes of a mountain, an old woman meets a mysterious, red-cloaked figure, shuffling Tarot cards. The figure gives the woman a white rose, which then turns red and dappled with blood, and tells her that "the day of their Deliverance is at hand." Prince Prospero, a Satanist, visits the village over which he holds dominion, and is confronted by two angry villagers, poor and starving. They inform him of the doom-laden message, which they believe is a prophecy of Prospero\'s downfall and liberation of the village. Prospero angrily sentences the pair to death, but a young Christian peasant girl named Francesca begs for their lives. Prospero demands that Francesca choose which of the men is to be saved and which is to die  but she is spared from having to choose when Prospero discovers that the old woman who encountered the red figure is infected with a deadly plague, the Red Death. He orders the village burned down to prevent the spread of the disease, and abducts Francesca. Prospero then invites several dozen of the local nobility to his castle for protection against the Red Death. At the castle, Francesca is finely dressed and tutored in etiquette by Prospero\'s jealous consort, Juliana, and the gathered nobility are entertained by a pair of dwarf dancers, Esmeralda and Hop-Toad. When Esmeralda accidentally spills a goblet of wine, one of Prospero\'s guests, Alfredo, strikes her. Prospero frightens Francesca with his coldness and attempts to corrupt her, in order to destroy her faith in God. He shows her a succession of different coloured rooms, but warns her not to enter the Black Room while she is still \'uninvited\'. Juliana expresses her wish to Prospero to be initiated in to his Satanic cult, and, that night, Francesca is terrified to discover Juliana and Prospero lying in a strange, hypnotic state in the Black Room. Gino, meanwhile, is being held prisoner in Prospero\'s castle, with the castle guards teaching him armed combat so that he can fight to the death against Ludovico as entertainment for the nobility. While Prospero further attempts to seduce Francesca, Juliana performs a ritual in the Black Room, pledging her soul to Satan. Francesca is horrified to learn of her actions, but Juliana gives Francesca the key to Ludovico and Gino\'s cell, and tells her to leave. During their escape, Gino and Ludovico kill three guards, and are then recaptured by Prospero, who points out to Francesca how her father and Gino have sinned. At a grand feast, Prospero summons Gino and Ludovico. As they refuse to fight each other, he instead has them each choose daggers to cut themselves with. One of the daggers is coated with poison, and, upon choosing the last dagger  Ludovico attempts to stab Prospero with it, but Prospero stabs him through the heart with his sword. He then casts Gino out of the castle, leaving him to be killed by the Red Death. Gino runs away through the woods, and encounters the red-cloaked figure, who presents him with a Tarot card, which he says represents mankind. Juliana is then put through her final initiation ceremony, where she drinks from a chalice, and suffers a terrifying hallucination  involving wild, dancing figures that stab at her as she lies prostrate on a table. Awakening from her dream, Juliana then declares herself the wife of Satan, proud that she has \'survived her own sacrifice\'. She wanders out through the coloured rooms, and is viciously attacked and killed by a crow. Prospero comments that Juliana is now truly married to Satan. Meanwhile, Hop-Toad, enraged by Alfredo\'s previous ill-treatment of Esmeralda, plans his revenge by persuading Alfredo to wear an ape costume to Prospero\'s grand masked ball, where Prospero has instructed that no one is to wear red. In the guise of the ape\'s trainer, Hop-Toad cruelly humiliates Alfredo in front of the assembled guests, before soaking him with brandy and setting him on fire. Prospero rewards Hop-Toad for his amusing \'entertainment\'. Outside the castle walls, Gino returns to rescue Francesca, and once again encounters the red-cloaked figure. The figure tells him not to enter the castle, and promises that he will send Francesca out to Gino shortly. Amid the general atmosphere of debauchery and depravity at the ball, Prospero notices the entry of the mysterious, red-cloaked figure. He and Francesca follow the figure through in to the Black Room, where Prospero believes the figure to be an ambassador of Satan. He asks to see the figure\'s face, but the figure tells Prospero that "There is no face of Death until the moment of your own death." As the ball is transformed into a danse macabre, Prospero asks for Francesca to be given the same high status in Hell as he believes he himself will receive. The figure appears to consent to his request, and sends Francesca outside, where he knows Gino is waiting. Before leaving, Francesca sadly kisses Prospero. The red-cloaked figure then reveals that he is not a servant of Satan  and tells Prospero that his beliefs will not save him, declaring that "Each man creates his own God for himself - His own Heaven, his own Hell." Prospero rips off the figure\'s red mask to reveal Prospero\'s own blood-spattered face. The figure is the Red Death himself - Prospero\'s \'own Hell\', and the \'moment of his death\'. Prospero attempts to flee through the now infected crowd, but his red-cloaked self is always in front of him. The Red Death finally corners Prospero in the Black Room, asking, "Why should you be afraid to die? Your soul has been dead for a long time", and strikes him down. In an epilogue, the Red Death is seen playing with his Tarot cards with a young child. Other similarly cloaked figures then gather around him, each wearing a different colour: the "White Death", the "Yellow Death", the Golden Death, the Blue Death, the Violet Death and the "Black Death". They discuss among themselves the numbers of people each of them had \'claimed\' that night, each accepting of their endless terrible task. When asked of his work, the Red Death says to them, "I called many...Peasant and prince...The worthy and the dishonoured. Six only are left." Among the surviving six are Francesca, Gino, Hop-Toad, Esmeralda, the little girl that the Red Death plays cards with, and an old man from a nearby village. The Red Death declares "Sic transit gloria mundi"  and the cloaked figures file offscreen in a grim procession. Over the procession are Poe\'s words: "And darkness and decay and the Red Death held illimitable dominion over all".'] ['Jacob Singer is a U.S. soldier deployed in the Mekong Delta during the Vietnam War. When the story begins, in 1971, helicopters are passing overhead, carrying supplies for what seems to be preparations for a Viet Cong offensive. Without any warning, Jacob\'s unit comes under heavy fire. The soldiers try to take cover but begin to exhibit strange behavior for no apparent reason. Jacob attempts to escape the unexplained insanity, only to be stabbed with a bayonet by an unseen attacker. The film then shifts back and forth from Vietnam to Jacob\'s memories  of his son Gabe and ex-wife Sarah, and to his present  relationship with a woman named Jezzie while working as a mailman in Brooklyn, New York City. During this latter period, Jacob faces several threats to his life and experiences grotesque hallucinations. It is also revealed that his son Gabe was hit by a car and killed before Jacob went to Vietnam. At a key moment, Jacob\'s friend and chiropractor, Louis, cites the 14th century Christian mystic Meister Eckhart: {{quote}} As the hallucinations become increasingly bizarre, Paul, one of his old Army friends, contacts Jacob to tell him about his hallucinations and is later killed when his car explodes. At the funeral, his surviving platoon-mates confess to Jacob they too have been seeing horrible hallucinations. Jacob is then approached by a man named Michael Newman, who claims to have been a chemist working with the Army\'s chemical warfare division in Saigon, where he worked on creating a drug that would increase aggression. The drug was code named "The Ladder" because it took people straight to their most primal urges. The drug was first tested on monkeys and then on a group of enemy POWs, with gruesome results. Later, small doses of "The Ladder" were secretly given to Jacob\'s battalion via their C-rations. Instead of targeting the enemy, however, the men in Jacob\'s unit attacked each other indiscriminately. This revelation insinuates that Jacob was stabbed by one of his fellow soldiers. The last scenes have Jacob returning to the apartment building he once lived in with Sarah. He enters and begins looking through an old shoe box, containing his memories and the pain he’s been clinging to, things like his dog tags and a picture of Gabe. Jacob then is surprised to see Gabe at the foot of the stairwell. Gabe takes Jacob by the hand and together the two of them ascend the stairwell and disappear into a bright light. At the dénouement, we learn Jacob never made it out of Vietnam; his body is shown in an Army triage tent with two surgeons just after he expired, with a now peaceful look on his face. Apparently, the entire series of events was his dying hallucination. Before the film credits, an on-screen title card states that reports of BZ testing by the U.S. Army on its soldiers during the Vietnam War were denied by the Pentagon.  {{cleanup|section|use references|dateaJfL49nuKFMC&pgPA202&dqbl&otsTQytVnWxAhB13GevpPDN-EHBxgQ&hlX&ei0CFQQ6AEwBg#v%22Wizard%20Postponed%22%20borges&f"The Ladder"st/>'] ["Following a 70s set prologue, the film takes place in present day Frankfurt, Germany.

He then tells Mattson to keep driving and yells at him to park his car in an unoccupied parking lot. After tying Mattson\'s arms behind the driver\'s seat with a jump rope and much pleading, he shoots Mattson with the gun which turns out to be a water gun. Both Chucky and a relieved Mattson begin to laugh. But shortly after Chucky uses a Play Pals plastic bag to terrorize and suffocate a defenseless Mattson, killing him in seconds.

With class dismissed Ms. Kettlewell, the teacher, uncovers Andy\'s paper with an insult written all over it in crayon. She confronts Andy and he is forced to stay after school for detention. He\'s locked inside the classroom while Ms. Kettlewell leaves to phone Joanne and Phil. Andy tries to warn anybody on the other side of the locked door, until Chucky starts pounding on the closet door. Andy escapes through the classroom window when Ms. Kettlewell returns and notices the classroom is empty. Hearing a sound coming from the closet, she assumes Andy is hiding, but uncovers nothing. Confused, she attempts to leave, but Chucky stabs her with an air pump and then beats her to death with a yard stick. Back at the foster home, Phil and Joanne confront Andy about the phone call from his teacher. Phil scolds Andy for telling what he believes to be fictional stories about Chucky, and shows him that Chucky has been in the basement since last night. In the middle of the night, Andy hears a noise downstairs. He arms himself with an electric carving knife and heads into the basement. Chucky wrestles with Andy, until Phil suddenly comes in and notices Andy holding the knife. Andy tries to warn him before he can walk down the steps, but Chucky trips him and leaves him dangling on the edge of the stairs, before dropping him, snapping his neck. Believing Andy responsible for the murder, Joanne angrily packs his things and sends him back to the foster care center. Kyle, knowing that Andy didn\'t kill Phil on purpose, tries unsuccessfully to reason with her and decides to have a cigarette outside, throwing Chucky into a garbage can. In using the tree swing, she accidentally uncovers the original Tommy doll, buried in the dirt. She then notices that the garbage can she tossed Chucky into is empty, causing her to realize that Andy was telling the truth. Terrified, she runs back into the house to warn Joanne, but discovers her dead body tied to a chair. Chucky reveals himself and threatens to kill Kyle, unless she cooperates.

Though it appears that Chucky had succeeded, he notices his nose bleeding, revealing that it is indeed too late and that he is trapped. Enraged, he tries to kill Andy, but Kyle manages to subdue him for a brief moment. While Andy and Kyle navigate through the huge labyrinth maze of boxes in the factory, Chucky does whatever he can to kill them, and in doing so loses a hand and both his legs in the process. Andy and Kyle think they have killed Chucky by sending him up a conveyor belt backward and having extra arms and legs attached to him. Seconds later as they walk away, Kyle is hit by the corpse of a dangling, swinging factory repair maintenance man that Chucky had killed earlier, and the force of the impact sends Kyle flying onto the conveyor belt, causing her to hit her head and be knocked unconscious, leaving Andy alone to fight Chucky. Andy manages to pour hot, melted plastic onto the killer doll, stopping him in his tracks. He then jumps onto the conveyor belt and wakes up Kyle, only to see Chucky emerge from the melted plastic pile and try to kill them until Kyle forces an air hose into his mouth, causing his head to inflate and explode, finally killing him. Andy and Kyle walk out of the factory into the bright new morning. Andy asks where they are going, to which Kyle replies "Home", even though neither one knows where home is. An extended ending reveals that a chunk of Chucky\'s skin after his head exploded got mixed in with the Good Guy doll making plaster. A machine is then seen making a new Good Guy Doll head, which then forms a sinister smile.'] ['For the third time, the evil Wishmaster returns with more evil and grotesquery to wreck the life of more innocents.

Rachel begins a new job at the Daily Astorian, a local newspaper, working for Max Rourke . Before long, there is news of a teenage homicide in town. Rachel investigates, finding the dead boy\'s face shows a deformed expression of horror just like the previous victims of Samara Morgan\'s cursed tape. Upon finding the boy\'s corpse, she also has a vision of Samara grabbing her and declaring "I found you." After that she goes to the police station in order to talk to the girl who witnessed the boy\'s death and after persuading the girl to tell her she finds out where the tape is. She takes the tape deep into the woods and burns it. Aidan has a dream in which he comes down to the T.V. room without Rachel home, and is pulled into the screen by Samara when the videotape starts. Back at home, Aidan starts to develop hypothermia, and his body is suddenly covered with bruises. At a county fair, Aidan takes pictures of himself in the bathroom mirror, with a blurred Samara standing behind him. His behavior grows increasingly odd and distant, and while driving back from the fair, the car carrying Aidan and Rachel is repeatedly attacked by a deer, nearly killing them. This event was apparently mysteriously foreseen by Aidan, who warned Rachel of impending danger seconds before the deer came out of nowhere. Strange occurrences within their house  frighten Rachel, leading her and Aidan to flee. Rachel subsequently asks Max if he can take care of the increasingly sick Aidan at his house. Max says that Aidan\'s condition merits a trip to the hospital, but Rachel, knowing that his illness is unnatural, is adamant that traditional doctors cannot help him. When Rachel attempts to give Aidan  a warm bath at Max\'s, a series of paranormal events leads to Rachel seeing Aidan\'s body replaced by Samara. Max walks in when she attempts to drown Samara, and sees her trying to drown Aidan instead. Suspicious, he insists on taking Aidan to the hospital against her wishes, stating, "You wanted my help, now you\'re getting it." Based on the bruises on Aidan\'s body, the hospital staff, particularly psychiatrist Dr. Emma Temple , suspect child abuse on Rachel\'s part, because Rachel reveals she suffered from postpartum depression, and won\'t allow her to be near her son. Desperate for answers, Rachel flees the hospital and returns to the Morgan Ranch  to dig deeper into Samara\'s past. Knowing that Samara was not Richard and Anna Morgan\'s biological child, she tracks down Samara\'s birth mother, Evelyn , who tried to drown Samara as an infant and has been living in a mental institution ever since. Meanwhile, Samara  inflicts a psychic assault on Dr. Temple, forcing Dr. Temple to commit suicide so that Samara  can escape the hospital. Evelyn advises Rachel to "listen to your baby" when she seeks advice on how to deal with Samara. Max goes to Rachel\'s house to check on her, only to find Aidan watching TV alone. He attempts to surreptitiously capture Aidan on film in order to reveal Samara, as Aidan had before Samara possessed him. Aidan/Samara notices the camera. When Rachel returns home, she finds Max\'s car parked outside and his dead body inside with the same warped expression of Samara\'s other victims. Disturbed and unsure of what to do, Rachel then goes inside to face her possessed son. Rachel tells Aidan/Samara that he should go to sleep. Aidan responds that he never sleeps. She suggests she make him something to eat. Rachel goes into the kitchen, preparing two peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. On one sandwich, she puts sleeping medication, intended to make Aidan unconscious. After eating the sandwich, Aidan soon falls asleep. Rachel fills the upstairs bathtub with water and holds an unconscious Aidan underwater. Aidan suddenly wakes up, telling Rachel that he is still Aidan. Rachel then drowns Aidan and Samara\'s spirit leaves his body, and Rachel is then able to revive him. However, Samara attempts to come back into the house through the TV set. Rachel grabs onto Samara as she is emerging, and is pulled into Samara\'s well inside the world of the cursed video. Looking up, Rachel realizes that the well lid is always left open. Rachel begins climbing the side of the well. Halfway up, Samara emerges from the water below and also ascends in a very inhuman fashion. As Rachel is climbing out of the well, Samara grabs her leg. Rachel manages to shake her off and then causes a jet of water to come out of the side of the well. Samara loses her grip and falls back down the well, however, she begins climbing again at a rapid rate. Rachel climbs out of the well just as Samara cries \'"Mommy!"\' in a deep voice. Rachel responds angrily that she\'s not her mother and pushes the lid shut just as Samara is about to escape, trapping her in the well. As Rachel wanders the monochromatic world of the cursed tape, she hears Aidan\'s voice and walks toward it, only to come to the cliff where Anna Morgan jumped to her death. She hears Aidan calling her name below. Determined to follow Aidan\'s voice, Rachel jumps off the cliff and ends up back in her living room with Aidan, where they embrace. Aidan calls Rachel \'"Mommy"\', and she asks him to just call her Rachel. The film ends when the camera then views the street and the sky, where a crescent moon can still be seen. The film then flickers out.'] ['An artist, John Jaspers  sells his soul to the mysterious M   in order to avenge the death of his girlfriend.

After he finds a cryptic note in Takayama\'s stomach, Reiko and Yōichi also turn up dead. Andō soon learns of a mysterious cursed videotape, haunted by the spirit of a murdered young woman. Rumor has it that anyone who watches the video will die exactly one week later. Despondent over the death of his own child, and believing that he is being guided by his rival\'s ghost, Andō decides to see the video for himself. After watching the tape, strange things begin to happen around him, and he soon discovers that the tape\'s restless spirit has different plans in store for him. With the help of Takayama\'s student, Mai Takano, Andō finds out more about Ryūji\'s past as well as the mysterious young woman, Sadako Yamamura. Searching for the truth about why Ryūji and Yōichi died from the virus while Reiko didn’t leads him to her boss Yoshino. Yoshino lets Andō in on a secret: he has the wife’s diary. She and Ryūji had been researching the cursed videotape. While Reiko had broken the curse, Ryūji died a week after watching the tape. Reiko believed that creating a copy would break the curse but Yōichi died a week after watching the tape, just as his father had. Yoshino shows Andō both the tape and the diary. When Andō tells Mai Takano what he’s done, she is shocked and can’t understand why, since she felt from the start that it was the video that killed Takayama and his family. As they are talking, Yoshino calls Andō. He admits that he wishes he’d never been involved in Reiko’s business. Andō believes that Yoshino had watched the video, but he denies it saying that he was too scared to. However, Yoshino still dies. Andō decides to destroy the videotapes and make sure that he will be the video\'s last victim. He then confides in Mai about his son’s death, and they end up sleeping together. Andō asks Mai if she’ll be there with him when he dies, but Mai tells him she’s too scared. He understands and decides to try to find out more about the virus that killed Takayama and his son. He discovers that the virus that killed Yoshino was different from the one that killed the father and son. Andō asks for tests to be run on him. Meanwhile, Mai Takano goes missing and Andō apparently survives the curse. He starts to feel that the story was just a myth and he\'s relieved when Mai turns up. However, he is shocked to find out that she has been found dead, having given birth with no sign of a baby. Andō goes back to work and sees “Mai” there. This woman claims to be Mai\'s sister but after a date and a night of intimacy, Andō finds out that she is none other than Sadako Yamamura, reborn and claiming to be "perfectly dual-gendered". He then learns that Takayama wasn’t helping Andō stop Sadako – instead, he and his family were helping her. Yoshino, Miyashita  and many others weren’t killed by a virus or the video but rather Ryūji\'s wife’s diary. In the end, Andō clones both Takayama and his son back to life with help from Sadako. Just as Ryūji leaves, he tells Andō "Many years will pass before our world will be at peace."'] ['In two flashbacks a relic is created in 50 AD and then hidden by Jews from a Crusader mob in medieval Rennes-le-Château. In present-day Rennes-le-Château an academic under instructions from Magnus Martel is seen with the relic - the Loculus - researching on the ground to find the right place to hide it. Magnus\'s son Jake, an ace cryptographer, is released from Wormwood Scrubs and recruited by his father for research on the Loculus. Magnus reveals that the Loculus relates to the Knights Templar and its sinister successor organisation known as "the order", and in secret receives calls from this organisation threatening him if he does not accelerate his research - in spite of this, Magnus realises the Loculus\' massive power for good or evil and has hidden it to ensure it does not fall into the order\'s hands. After breaking a code on the Loculus to reveal the word "palingenesis", Jake hides whilst members of the organisation kill and flay his father. Jake then flees with another researcher on the project  and seeks help from the Roman Catholic priest Father Ray Connolly. The trail takes the three characters to  a Cambridge library to research Isaac Newton\'s involvement in attempting to unlock the Loculus and to Rennes-le-Château and its Tour Magdala. They discover that the Loculus is related to Christian eschatology and has been hidden on Patmos, writing-place of the Book of Revelation. Father Connolly stays behind in London as back-up while Mira and Jake go to Patmos and find the Loculus hidden in a crypt beneath a Greek Orthodox church and former temple to Mary Magdalene as Aphrodite. Using the reflective properties of a hermaphrodite symbol on the Loculus they reveal a hexagram built into the floor, an occult symbol. Jake and Mira disrobe and make love within the symbol in an attempt to unlock it, experiencing a vision of themselves as Christ and Mary Magdalene before fleeing into the crypt when they hear a pursuer approaching. The pursuer turns out to in fact be Father Connolly and together they finally work out the Loculus\'s meaning - its significance in fact lies in the four nails holding it together, which are those used to crucify Christ and retain organic matter with his DNA, preserved in a ceremony on Mount Hebron. The Templars and the order have continually attempted to use the DNA on it to resurrect Christ , but have failed until the genetic advances of the present day. The three argue as to what to do with the discovery - Jake concurs with his dead father and wishes to destroy it to keep it out of the order\'s hands, whilst Ray wishes to take it to a trustworthy African cardinal at the Vatican. Ray prevails and traps the other two, but on arrival in Rome the order\'s Grand Master seizes the Loculus, puts Ray under torture and sends troops to kill Mira and Jake. The couple manage to flood the chambers with sand to kill the troops and the church\'s monks are alerted to the couple\'s plight by an emergency postcard sent by Connolly before his departure, but only Mira manages to escape - Jake is fatally buried. In the meantime the Grand Master has cloned Christ and had him not only proclaimed the Messiah by the Vatican but put under his own tutelage and control, so that he can brutalize him and rule the world through him. The film closes with Mira realising that she  has given birth to a child by a Martel  and that she must keep him secret from the order (as predicted by [[s:Bible  so as to oppose the Grand Master\'s puppet Christ.'] ['{{plot}} Six years after the events of the first film, Kristen Parker makes a replica of a house on Elm Street. While she is asleep she dreams about a little girl outside the house. When Kristen wakes up and goes to the bathroom she finds she is still asleep and encounters Freddy Krueger, who slashes her wrists with the razors on his glove. When Kristen awakes, she is holding a razor blade to her wrist. Her mother mistakes this incident as a suicide attempt and places Kristen in Westin Hills, a psychiatric hospital. Kristen meets the other patients of the hospital- Joey Crusel, who does not speak; Taryn White, an ex-drug addict; Roland Kincaid, a tough kid with behavioral problems; Phillip Anderson, a talented sculptor; Jennifer Caulfield, a wannabe actress; Will Stanton, who uses a wheelchair because of an earlier suicide attempt. They are the "last of the Elm Street children" – the remaining children of the vigilantes who killed Freddy. Kristen also meets Dr. Neil Gordon, a psychiatrist, and Nancy Thompson, the new staff research scientist. All of the kids are being tormented by Freddy in their dreams. If Freddy kills them in their dream, they die "for real." When Kristen has another terrifying dream where she is attacked by Freddy in the form of a giant snake, she reveals a latent ability to bring others into her dreams by bringing Nancy into the dream to assist her. Nancy sees the potential of Kristen\'s ability to defeat Freddy for good. Freddy kills two patients when they fall asleep. He slashes Phillip\'s feet and wrists and uses his tendons to walk him through the hospital like a marionette. He walks Philip to the top of the building and cuts the tendons, sending Phillip falling to his death as the other patients watch in horror. The next night, while Jennifer watches TV, the host of a talk show turns into Freddy and attacks the guest, Zsa Zsa Gabor. Jennifer walks over to the TV and smacks it. Two large mechanical arms explode out of the sides and pick her up. Freddy\'s head emerges from the TV and tells her "Welcome to Prime Time Bitch" before smashing her head into the screen. Meanwhile, Dr. Gordon receives visits from a mysterious nun, who introduces herself as Sister Mary Helena. She tells Dr. Gordon that Freddy Krueger was born in the abandoned wing of the same hospital, Westin Hills, after inmates gang-raped his mother, Amanda Krueger. Amanda Krueger was a staff member who was accidentally locked inside over the Christmas holidays. The nun also says that when he was killed, Freddy Krueger was never properly buried and must be laid to rest in consecrated ground. Nancy tells the kids during a group session that in their dreams they can be whomever, and possibly do whatever, they want. Nancy convinces Dr. Gordon to try an experimental hypnosis to put the kids and themselves into a deep sleep and have Kristen attempt to pull them into her dream. The attempt does not go well. Freddy, in the form of a hot nurse, lures Joey away and holds him captive in the dream world and renders him comatose in the real world. As a result, Dr. Carver fires Neil and Nancy from the hospital. Nancy goes to see her father, Lt. Donald Thompson. She makes an impassioned plea to him for help which ultimately falls on deaf ears. Neil tells her to go back to the hospital to help the kids while he forces Lt. Thompson to help him find Freddy\'s remains and bury them. The two men stop at a church to collect holy water and a crucifix. Back at the hospital, Nancy and the kids attempt a group sleep session to try to go in and free Joey and get to Kristen, who was thrown in the "quiet room" and sedated without her consent. As soon as the kids fall asleep, Freddy separates them. He kills Taryn by giving her a drug overdose, and he stabs Will in the stomach with his glove. Kincaid, who dreams of having super strength, manages to fight his way through Freddy\'s barriers and reunite with Nancy and Kristen. The three save Joey before Freddy can kill him. Kincaid attacks Freddy, but Freddy easily picks him up with one arm, which shocks Nancy. Krueger reveals he gains strength from imprisoning the souls of his victims inside him. Freddy is about to kill Kincaid when he senses that someone is messing with his corpse and disappears. Neil and Lt. Thompson have found Freddy\'s remains in a large auto salvage yard. They begin to dig a makeshift grave when the bones come to life. Lt. Thompson attempts to attack the Freddy-skeleton but the skeleton kills him by throwing him on a car fin. The skeleton then beats Neil with a shovel, leaving him unconscious near the makeshift grave. Still in the group sleep session, the remaining kids and Nancy proceed to make their way through Freddy\'s lair when they come to a room full of mirrors. Each of the party are grabbed and pulled through the walls by Freddy, except for Joey who lets out a piercing scream which shatters the mirrors, freeing them. Nancy notices a bright light from an adjoining room and realizes it is her father. Her father says his spirit has crossed over and wanted to say goodbye to her, and they embrace. Seconds later, Nancy is stabbed twice in the stomach by Freddy, who was disguised as her father. Believing his biggest threat has finally been removed, Freddy closes the door on Kincaid and Joey and proceeds to attack Kristen. Just as he is about to kill her, Nancy attacks from behind, making Krueger stab himself with the glove. At the same exact time, Neil awakens and sprinkles the holy water on Freddy\'s remains. He also uses the crucifix and completes the burial, causing Krueger to disappear in a brilliant white light. Nancy, grievously wounded, dies in Kristen\'s arms. At the Thompson\'s funeral, Neil sees the mysterious nun again. When he goes to thank her, she vanishes. He is left standing by a gravestone. On the stone there is a name, Amanda Krueger; just below that is another name, Sister Mary Helena. The nun was the spirit of Freddy\'s mother. Later, Neil falls asleep at his home, where he has the same house Kristen made at the beginning of the film. A light suddenly comes on inside the model house, implying Freddy\'s still alive, which sets up the events of the next film.'] ['A group of teenage girls must spend the night in an old house in order to receive a minor amount of money.

Jamie and Lisa wonder who would have sent the doll. Lisa then remembers a poem she knew when she was younger, about a woman named Mary Shaw. Jamie disregards this and leaves to get dinner; he returns to discover Lisa is dead with her tongue ripped out, and Billy lying on the floor near her body. Detective Jim Lipton  suspects Jamie of the murder, but there is no evidence against him. Jamie discovers that Billy belonged to Mary Shaw , a ventriloquist from his hometown of Ravens Fair. Returning to the town for Lisa\'s funeral, he first confronts his wealthy, estranged father about Mary Shaw. Jamie\'s father is wheelchair-bound with a new wife, Ella , who takes care of him. His father and Ella remind him of the children\'s poem, regarding Shaw and her penchant for cutting out her victims\' tongues. Jamie leaves his father\'s home, warning Ella that his father is a monster. After Lisa\'s funeral, Jamie wanders into an old cemetery, where he finds Shaw\'s grave and those of her puppets. Marion , the mortician\'s senile wife, warns him of the danger of Shaw\'s puppets, and he realizes he should rebury Billy. He does so, only to find the puppet in his room later, accompanied by Lipton — who dug the puppet back up in the belief that it is evidence that Jamie is trying to conceal —, still not convinced of Jamie\'s innocence. Jamie tells him about the poem, but Lipton is skeptical. The next morning, Jamie steals Billy from the detective, and brings him to the mortician, Henry, who finally tells him about Mary Shaw. Shaw was a famous ventriloquist whose ambition was to make the perfect puppet. One night, at a performance attended by Henry, a young boy named Michael ([[Steven Taylor  heckled her, claiming that he could see Mary\'s lips moving. Mary quickly rebuffed this by presenting herself and Billy talking at the same time, and impressed the entire audience while also telling the boy, "Now, who\'s the dummy?." Michael went missing shortly after. While his body was never found, Shaw was blamed, and the village murdered her by cutting her tongue out. Her final wish was to turn her body into a ventriloquist\'s puppet and to be buried with her 101 puppets. Henry, at a very young age, wandered into his fathers mortuary and accidentally knocked the coffin over. Shaw\'s body came to life and she began approaching Henry. He survived because he covered his mouth to keep from screaming; Mary can only kill her victims when they scream. Henry\'s father then burst into the room, and discovered Henry cowering in the corner and Shaw\'s body on the floor.

Jamie confronts his father and learns that the missing boy was his great-uncle. His father tells him that the boy\'s family, who was rich and respected by the entire community, murdered Shaw by forcing her to scream and then cut out her tongue. Other people of the village helped them in doing the task. The men involved were then killed off one by one, found with their tongues ripped out. Their wives, children, and children\'s children all suffered the same fate; Jamie\'s father deliberately drove Jamie away to try and spare him from that fate. His father then tells him Shaw will come back for them. Lipton tells Jamie that he exhumed Shaw\'s puppets\' graves and that all of them are missing. Jamie then receives a phone call from Henry, telling him to go to the theater, when in truth Henry had just been murdered by Mary Shaw; when she takes her victims\' tongues, she acquires their voices. With the detective following close behind, Jamie returns to the theater and Shaw\'s living quarters. Discovering a hidden back room, they find the body of Michael Ashen, murdered by Mary Shaw, strung up like a marionette, and 100 of Shaw\'s puppets. Michael was kidnapped by Mary Shaw and treated him as her twisted version of a beloved son after his corpse was turned into a puppet, symbolizing that Mary Shaw always wanted to have children but was unable to do so, thus using dummies to compensate with her frustration. Suddenly, one of the dolls begins talking to them. The doll, possessed by Shaw, tells them she wants to silence those who silenced her, and that she killed Lisa because she was pregnant. Shaw herself appears behind the doll, but Lipton shoots the doll and she disappears. She then begins materializing via the other dolls. Realizing that destroying all the dolls is Shaw\'s weakness, they set the room on fire and run from the theater with Shaw\'s ghost chasing them. When the catwalk in which they are running collapses, Shaw kills Lipton in mid-fall after he screams. Jamie escapes as the theater burns down, destroying all of Shaw\'s dolls, putting an end to her reign of terror. Jamie realizes that Billy is the only remaining puppet, and that the only way to get rid of Shaw is to destroy him. He goes to Henry, with who he had left Billy, only to discover that he is dead with his tongue ripped out. After Marion tells Jamie that his father took the doll, he returns to his father\'s house to destroy Billy. When he arrives, Mary Shaw reappears, but is forced to retreat when Jamie throws Billy into the fireplace. Jamie finds his father in his wheelchair, staring blankly. As he approaches him, Jamie is horrified as he discovers his father is dead, with his entire back hollowed out and replaced with a wooden shaft used in ventriloquist dummies. Jamie realizes his father had been wearing the same suit, and Ella had been at his side the entire time with her hand behind his back. As Mary Shaw\'s "perfect doll", Ella appears to Jamie, asking "Now who\'s the dummy?" Jamie screams and Mary Shaw materializes through Ella. Jamie becomes a doll, shown in Mary Shaw\'s photo album. In an alternate ending, Ella had been abused by Jamie\'s father until she suffered a miscarriage; she sought revenge, digging up one of Mary Shaw\'s puppets and was instantly possessed by Mary Shaw\'s ghost . Possessed by Shaw\'s spirit, Ella becomes the perfect puppet that Shaw strove to make. After killing Jamie\'s father, she hollowed out his corpse and used Jamie\'s father\'s corpse as a puppet to lure him back to Ravens Fair. Ella sits a tied up Jamie alongside his father and Lisa in a macabre family portrait. Jamie screams as Mary Shaw attacks him, presumably taking his tongue. The film ends with Ella reciting the poem to Jamie\'s corpse, tucked into bed like a child. Before blowing out the candle, Ella tells Jamie that if he sees Mary Shaw, the only thing that will protect him is silence.{{cite journal}}'] [" The movie begins with the violent and painful death of its protagonist, French sociologist Jean-Charles Pommier . The moment he dies in the Emergency Room of a Los Angeles city hospital the physician treating him, Dr. Eileen Flax , becomes possessed with his memories. Dr. Flax relives the last week of Pommier's life until the moment of his death.  After travelling abroad and studying the spiritual beliefs and religious practices of primitive peoples, Pommier finally settles down with his patient wife Niki  in Los Angeles to teach at UCLA. His home in the suburbs is vandalized one night by a gang of street punks who travel about in a black van. They are very interested in his house and he finds that they have built a macabre shrine in his garage to a murderer who recently killed two girls who lived in the house. He then starts to study them because they are an urban nomad culture that is strikingly similar to the ones he has studied. He begins to observe them, following them around and covertly taking their pictures. He develops the pictures and is puzzled to find that they do not show up in them. Then he begins to realize that they are actually the Einwetok, demonic Inuit trickster spirits that take human form, commit acts of violence and mischief, and who are attracted to places of violence and death. Now that they are aware of him, they plan to claim his soul to keep their existence a secret.  Dr. Flax wakes in the bedroom of Pommier's house in the arms of his wife. They try to flee the city to escape the nomads but the street starts to fill with an army of leather-clad bikers and punks. They storm the house, forcing the women to flee to the attic. One of the nomads, Dancing Mary , breaks into the attic but leaves after scaring them. Much later, the nomads have left the house and the ladies leave the attic to find the house a shambles. Packing bags, they flee the city. The next day, as they are driving down a back road, a leather-clad man on a motorcycle rides around them. Flax warns Niki that whatever she sees, she should not stop. As they drive by, they are horrified to see that it is Pommier, now one of the nomads."] ['Ward stars as 1940s hardboiled private detective Phillip Lovecraft, in a fictional universe where magic is real, monsters and mythical beasts stalk the back alleys, zombies are used as cheap labor, and everyone — except Lovecraft — uses magic every day. Yet, cars, telephones and other modern technology also exist in this world.'] ['The plot revolves around the crisis of faith suffered by Father Merrin following the horrific events he witnessed during World War II. Many years before the events in The Exorcist, the young Father Lankester Merrin  travels to East Africa. Merrin has taken a sabbatical from the Church and devoted himself to history and archaeology as he struggles with his shattered faith. He is haunted especially by an incident in a small village in occupied Holland during World War II, where he served as parish priest. Near the end of the war, a sadistic Nazi SS commander, in retaliation for the murder of a German trooper, forces Merrin to participate in arbitrary executions in order to save a full village from slaughter. After WWII, Merrin is an archaeologist in Cairo, when he is approached by a collector of antiquities who asks him to come to a British excavation in the Turkana region of Kenya. This dig is excavating a Christian Byzantine church from about circa 500 A.D. — long before Christianity had reached that region of Africa. Merrin is asked by the collector to recover an ancient relic of a demon before the British can find it. Merrin agrees and travels to the dig site. He is joined by Father Francis, a Vatican scholar who was on his way to do missionary work in East Africa but is diverted by the Vatican to ensure that the church is not desecrated. Upon arriving at the dig, Merrin meets Major Granville, the British military officer in charge of the dig. Merrin also meets the chief excavator, a brutish man with visible boils on his face. And he meets Sarah, a doctor who spent time in a concentration camp during WWII and is haunted by what happened to her there. Merrin\'s translator and guide is Chuma. In addition, Merrin learns that the diggers are disappearing or leaving in droves because the local tribemen fear the church is cursed. Merrin witnesses a digger inexplicably experience a seizure. Merrin visits the dig site, although only the dome is uncovered, with the rest of the church buried beneath the earth. Merrin discovers that the church is in perfect condition, as though it had been buried immediately after the construction was completed. Merrin, Francis, and Chuma enter the church through the dome. They find it is near pristine condition, but there are two oddities. First, all of the statues of the angels holding weapons are pointing the spears downward, whereas it is convention for statues of angels not to have weapons or for them to be pointed triumphantly to heaven. Merrin and Francis deduce the sculptors were trying to depict the angels restraining something that was beneath the church. The second disturbing discovery is that someone has vandalized the church by ripping the enormous crucifix from its place on the altar and suspending it with Christ on the cross in an upside position, which is considered a desecration. Merrin is determined to learn more about the archeological dig and asks to consult with the lead archeologist, Monsieur Bession. Merrin is told by Sarah that Bession went insane three weeks earlier and was transferred to a mental hospital in Nairobi. Merrin visits Bession\'s tent at the dig site and sees dozens of drawings of the same thing, the demon artifact that Merrin was asked to find by the collector. Merrin then travels to Nairobi to visit Bession. But when he enters Bession\'s room, he discovers Bession has carved a swastika on his chest and is speaking through demonic possession in the voice of the sadistic SS commander who tormented Merrin during the war. As Merrin registers these events, Bession slashes his own throat after saying he was "free." Father Gionetti, warden of the asylum, speculates that Bession was not possessed but rather "touched" by a demon, which drove him mad and eventually to suicide. Merrin is very skeptical, but before he returns to the dig site, Father Gionetti gives him the volume of Roman rituals to use in exorcism, although Merrin claims he will never use them. Upon returning to the village, strange events continue. A local boy is attacked and killed by hyenas that seem to continuously stalk the dig, night and day. His younger brother, Joseph, enters a fugue state after watching his brother ripped to pieces. Merrin begins to suspect that something evil lies in the church and is infecting the region. There are stories of an epidemic that wiped out an entire village. However, when Merrin, growing suspicious of these rumors, digs up one of the graves of the supposed victims of this plague, he discovers it is empty. Meanwhile, the evil grows, turning people against each other and resulting in violence, atrocities, and more bloodshed. Father Francis reveals to Merrin that the builders of the church never meant it to be recorded in Vatican documents, however, a vague reference to it was recorded, leading to its subsequent discoveries in the 19th and 20th centuries. Francis also reveals that the church stands on the supposed site where Satan fell to earth after the war in heaven, and it was constructed by early Christians in an attempt to purify the evil that resides there. Beneath the church lies the ruins of an even older temple — but not a Christian one. Rather, in the ruins under the church, Merrin and his allies find demonic icons, and other signs of evil and Satanism. This land is where he first encounters the demon that calls itself Pazuzu, which he will encounter again in The Exorcist. This is the demon that "brushed" Bession  and Joseph . At the end of the movie, the dig\'s doctor, Sarah, turns out to be the possessed individual and has the demon exorcised from her in the tunnels below the church but dies. Dr. Merrin and Joseph emerge from the church,  and history has repeated itself. 50  years ago, everyone at the site was killed by an evil presence from the church, except for one priest. Now, only Father Merrin and the little boy are left as the British soldiers and the local tribes have annihilated each other. Merrin returns to Rome and meets with the collector at a cafe, explaining he was unable to find the relic, the collector replies, "But you found something....Didn\'t you?"... As he leaves, Merrin is revealed to be wearing a collar and is now a priest again, having regained his faith in God, after defeating the demon with holy exorcism rituals.'] ['The film begins with the point-of-view of someone wandering through the streets of Georgetown, a voice informing us "I have dreams... of a rose... and of falling down a long flight of stairs." The point of view shows a warning of evil about to arrive later that night at a church. Demonic growls are heard, leaves and other street trash suddenly come flying into the church as a crucifix comes to life. It then cuts to Lieutenant William F. Kinderman  at a crime scene, where a 12-year-old boy named Thomas Kintry has been murdered. Kinderman takes his friend, a priest named Father Dyer , out to see their mutually favorite film It\'s a Wonderful Life. Kinderman later relates the gruesome details of the murder of the young boy he was investigating that morning, including his crucifixion. Another murder soon takes place; a priest found decapitated in a church. Dyer is shortly hospitalized and found murdered the next day, with the words "IT\'S A WONDERFULL LIFE" written on a wall in Dyer\'s blood. At each murder scene, the fingerprints at the crime scenes do not match up, indicating a different person was responsible for each. Kinderman tells hospital staff the reason for his unease; fifteen years ago the vicious serial killer, "The Gemini" , was executed; with every victim he cut off the right index finger and carved the Zodiac sign of Gemini into the palm of their left hand. Kinderman noticed the hands of the three new victims and verified that the Gemini\'s sign has been there. The Gemini Killer also always used an extra "L" in his notes sent to the media, such as "usefull" or "carefull". Furthermore, to filter out false confessions, the original Gemini Killer\'s true mutilations were kept a secret by the Richmond police\'s homicide department; the newspapers were made to wrongfully report that the left middle finger was severed and that the Gemini sign was carved on the back of the victim. Kinderman visits the head of the psychiatric ward, Dr. Temple ([[Scott Wilson , who relates the history of a man in Cell 11, that he was found wandering aimlessly fifteen years ago with amnesia. The man was locked up, catatonic up until recently when he began to be violent and claim to be the Gemini Killer. Kinderman sees that the patient resembles his dead friend, Father Damien Karras ([[Jason Miller . However the patient brags of being the Gemini Killer, expressing ignorance over who Father Karras is, and boasts of killing Father Dyer. The next morning, a nurse and Dr. Temple are found dead. Kinderman returns to see the patient in Cell 11, who claims to be the Gemini Killer\'s spirit, revealing that after his execution his soul entered Karras\'s dying body. The demon Pazuzu who had possessed the girl Regan MacNeil, was furious at being pushed out of the child\'s body and is exacting its revenge by putting the soul of the Gemini Killer into the body of Father Karras. Each evening, the soul of the Gemini leaves the body of Karras and possesses the elderly people with senile dementia elsewhere in the hospital and uses them to commit the murders. The Gemini Killer also reveals to have forced Dr. Temple to bring Kinderman to him or he would suffer in unspeakable ways - Temple believed his apparent bluff, however, he couldn\'t take the pressure, and so he committed suicide. The Gemini possesses an old woman who makes a failed attempt to murder Julie, Kinderman\'s daughter. The possessed patient attacks Kinderman, but the attack abruptly ends when a priest, Father Paul Morning , enters the corridor leading to cell 11 and attempts an exorcism on the patient. It goes wrong when Pazuzu intervenes, taking over the patient\'s body, and the priest is all but slain. Kinderman arrives in time and attempts to euthanise Karras after finding the body of the priest, only to be hurled into the wall by the possessed Karras. Father Morning manages to briefly regain consciousness and tells Karras "Damien. Fight him." Karras regains his free will briefly and cries to Kinderman "Bill, now, shoot now, kill me now--!" Kinderman fires his revolver several times hitting Karras in the chest, fatally wounding him. The Gemini is now gone and Karras is finally free. With weak breaths he says "We won Bill, now free me." Kinderman puts his revolver against Karras\' head and fires. The film ends with Karras receiving a proper funeral.'] ["The film takes place in a theater late at night as a troupe of actors are rehearsing a musical about a mass murderer known as the Night Owl.

He is sentenced to death for his activities, including the bewitching of Redferne\'s bride-to-be, but before the execution Satan appears and propels the Warlock forward in time to 20th century Los Angeles, California. Redferne follows through the portal. The Warlock is tasked with assembling the three separated sets of pages of The Grand Grimoire, a Satanic book that will reveal the "true" name of God. Arriving in late 1980s Los Angeles, The Warlock is innocently taken in by Kassandra  and her roommate, Chas . After killing Chas, the Warlock also murders a fraudulent psychic woman, whose eyes are controlled by Satan and will be used to guide him to the ancient book. Redferne arrives soon after the murder of the psychic. He tries to track the Warlock, using the Warlock\'s blood on a Witch Compass. Kassandra calls the police on Redferne and he is taken away. When Kassandra sees the needle on the Witch Compass move, she realizes that Redferne was telling the truth. She sees that the Warlock has returned and he finds the first part of the Grimoire in her dining room table. He then inflicts on Kassandra a curse of rapid aging. The next morning, Kassandra finds that she has aged 20 years, making her 40 years old. She gets Redferne out of jail to help her. Redferne advises her that she needs to get her charm bracelet back from the Warlock to break the spell or else she will die in three days of old age. She decides to join forces with Redferne to hunt down the Warlock. The Warlock then encounters a young boy playing football in a trailer park. Redferne and Kassandra, later come across the same trailer park. Redferne realizes that the boy was killed for his fat . The Warlock is seen late flying off to find the second part of the book. Kassandra feels herself getting ill as another day passes. She has aged another 20 years, making her 60 years old. Morning comes and the Warlock has found the second half of the book. An elderly Mennonite man notices the signs of bewitchment when the cream has curdled overnight and his horse sweats in the morning. He then proceeds to paint a hex sign on his barn. Redferne sees the hex sign and asks Kassandra to stop the car. They meet with the Mennonite and urge his family to leave the farm at once. The Mennonite shows Redferne the attic door, which is ajar. Redferne nails the door shut, give Kassandra and the Mennonite pennies to hold in their mouths so the Warlock cannot hex them. Redferne finds a page of the Grimoire in the attic and realizes what the Warlock is planning to do. Kassandra points out that if the Grimoire is so sought after, why would he leave one page behind. Redferne realizes this and ends up battling the Warlock in the attic. The battle ends up outside with the Warlock being stabbed with a weathervane. Redferne tries to trap the Warlock in his thumb and toe locks while he is weakened, but the Mennonite locks eyes with the Warlock, enabling the Warlock to hex him, making the Mennonite\'s eyes bleed. As Redferne tries to cure the Mennonite, Kassandra chases off after the Warlock and ends up retrieving her charm bracelet, which succeeds in breaking the aging curse and restoring her age to 20. Redferne helps the Mennonite and asks Kassandra to help him stop the Warlock from undoing all of creation, promising to protect her. Kassandra comes up with a plan; instead of them chasing the Warlock all over the place, they would better off finding the third part of the Grimoire. They end up going to Boston to find the church that had the Grimoire . They find out from the pastor that the pages were buried in three places: one part was placed within the hollow of a table used in taking communion . The second part was given to a vicar who had founded a ministry west of the Carolinas, placed within an armoire  and a Boston cemetery that Redferne remembers from his day. When they arrive, he shows Kassandra that the ground is consecrated and the Warlock will not be able to enter. Meanwhile, the pastor arrive home to find his wife and unborn twins under threat from the Warlock. The pastor has no choice but to tell him where Redferne and Kassandra went. In the cemetery, Kassandra and Redfern search for a hex sign to show where the pages are buried. Kassandra finds them in Redferne\'s grave. They start to leave believing the pages to be safe. Then Kassandra spots a billboard showing that the graveyard is being moved for a new condominium project, which means the ground where Redferne\'s grave is no longer located upon consecrated land. Kassandra spares Redferne the agony of seeing his own corpse by opening his coffin and retrieving the pages. The Warlock then arrives, demanding the pages. Redferne splits up the pages and they run off with them, but the Warlock catches and tortures Kassandra forcing Redferne to surrender the pages to him; however before he can unite the pages, Redferne pushes the Warlock head onto consecrated ground, burning him. The Warlock responds by placing "witch fire" in Redferne\'s mouth and tossing Kassandra into the river. The Warlock then restores the Grimoire and the name is revealed . Before he can utter it in reverse, Kassandra injects him with salt water, killing the Warlock. Redferne is then returned to his own time, and Kassandra sees an inscription from Redferne, to her, on his tombstone . In the end, Kassandra is seen amongst the vast Salt Lake Flats, where she has buried the book in the hopes that no other Warlock will be able to retrieve it.'] ['{{plot}}  The story revolves around the daughter of an Egyptologist who is possessed by an evil spirit.

Emily soon discovers that both of her children are appearing and disappearing out of their rooms every day and night. Both Susie and Tommy have gained supernatural access to dimensional doorways. A few days later, George\'s eyesight returns, and he describes the design on the wall of the tomb he\'d entered to a colleague called Wiler, Wiler guesses that it may be the Sacred Symbol of the Grand Shadow, a sight of terrible evil. Over the next few days, the Hacker family experiences more odd happenings. A scorpion appears in a desk drawer when Susie opens it. Later, Jamie Lee is menaced by a snake that attacks her in the apartment building cellar during a game of hide-and-seek with the kids. Then, Emily discovers piles of sand on the floors of their bedroom and adjacent rooms. Also, the building superintendent dies in a supernatural freak accident then the elevator he\'s riding in malfunctions, and drops open the floor of the elevator car, making him plunge to his death. A little while later, Luke Anderson , an eccentric colleague of Emily\'s, arrives at the apartment to work with her about her latest journalist work detailing her travels in Egypt. When Luke hears a noise coming from Susie\'s bedroom, he enters it and tries to force open a jammed bedroom door. He opens it only to be sucked into the dimensional portal and finds himself transported to the deserts of Egypt where he later dies from dehydration in the vast, arid desert. The Hackers think Luke\'s disappearance is merely one of his practical jokes, but they never learn of his fate, nor find any trace of him. Jamie Lee takes the kids out to nearby Central Park to play where she takes photos of them. A woman picks up a discarded Polaroid photo taken of Susie. It shows nothing but the amulet against the grassy background. The woman contacts a man called Adrian Marcato  with her find. The next day, the woman drops the Polaroid down to Mrs. Hacker from a window overlooking the pavement. Marcato\'s name and phone number are written on it. Meanwhile, Susie and Tommy continues to appear and disappear from their bedrooms on what Tommy called "voyages". Soon, Jamie Lee herself disappears after entering Tommy\'s room. When Emily asks Tommy if he saw Jamie Lee recently, he tells his mother that Jamie Lee has not come back from her own voyage. That evening, George\'s colleague Wiler is killed when he gets bitten by a cobra that magically appears in his office as he is looking over the photo of the amulet that Hackers have given him. The photo magically disappears and reappears in Susie\'s hand as she recovers from a mysterious fit. George and Emily track down Marcato to his antique shop and demand to know what his involvement is. He tells them about the evil symbolism of the jewel, and suggest that Susie has absorbed its energy.

When George and Emily find the amulet in Susie\'s bedroom drawer, she appears to them glowing with an unearthly blue light, and then faints. Marcato is called to the Hackers apartment to examine Susie, but is possessed by her inner voice crying for help, and falls to the ground, bleeding and foaming at the mouth. Marcato regains consciousness and succeeds in linking minds briefly with George, showing him a glimpse into the eldritch Egypt his children have been visiting. Susie is then taken to a nearby hospital where the physician Dr. Foster  examines her and is baffled by her mysterious illness. An X-ray taken shows the dark shape of a hooded cobra mark in her chest. While Emily maintains a bedside vigil for the near-comatose Susie, Tommy is alone at the apartment when he is partly affected too. Suddenly, Jamie Lee turns up, bursting through a wall as a briefly reanimated rotting cadaver before she drops dead. A strange blue light of negative energy is shown flowing from Tommy, the bed-ridden Susie, and the dimensional doorways and channeled into Marcato\'s home where he is inciting a spell in the ancient Egyptian language. George goes to see Marcato again, who tells them that he can stop worrying about his children. Through an ancient Egyptian spell, Marcato has channeled all the evil energy away from George\'s children and the curse is now on him. Marcato gives George the amulet and tells him to discard it so the curse will not affect anyone else. That night, Marcato is killed at his shop when the re-animated carcasses of his stuffed birds come to life and tear him to pieces. At the hospital, Susie wakes up to see her grateful mother by her side and both are happy that Susie is all better. The following morning, George, following Marcato\'s last suggestion, flings the amulet into the East River, bringing an end to their ordeal. In the final scene back in Egypt, the mystical blind woman once again appears and gives exactly the same amulet to another young girl, intending to continue the curse for the forces of darkness, bringing it full circle.'] ['A small group of Roman Catholics believe that Satan intends to become man just as God did in the person of Jesus.

Among those present is Brian Marsh , a student in metaphysics. After researching the text found next to the cylinder, it is discovered that the liquid is the corporeal embodiment of the Anti-Christ. The liquid appears sentient, producing increasingly complex data that is revealed by computer decoding to include differential equations. Over a period of two days, small jets of liquid escape the cylinder and possess the group one by one to use them against the remaining survivors. Attempts to escape the building are thwarted by a mass of possessed street people who surround the building, barricade the doors from the outside, and kill two of the group. Birack and the priest theorize that the being within the cylinder is actually the son of an even more powerful force of evil, the "Anti-God", who is bound to the realm of anti-matter. The survivors also find themselves sharing a recurring dream  showing a shadowy figure emerging from the front of the church. The shaky transmission with the shadowy figure seems to change slightly with each occurrence of the dream, revealing progressively more detail. The narration of the transmission each time instructs the \'dreamer\' that they are witnessing an actual broadcast from the future, and they must alter the course of events to prevent this occurrence. Eventually, the cylinder opens and the remaining liquid is absorbed into the body of Kelly ([[Susan Blanchard , one of the students who becomes the physical vessel of the Anti-Christ: A gruesomely disfigured being, with powers of telekinesis and regeneration, who attempts to bring the Anti-God through a dimensional portal using a mirror, initially failing because the mirror is too small. At the climax of the film, Kelly finds a larger wall mirror, and begins to draw the Father\'s hand through it as most of the group are immobilized by fights with the other possessed members. Marsh\'s lover, Catherine Danforth , is the only one free to act, so she tackles Kelly, causing both of them to fall through the portal. The priest shatters the mirror, trapping Kelly, the Anti-God, and Danforth in the other realm. Danforth is seen briefly on the other side of the mirror reaching out to the portal before it closes, leaving her in darkness. Immediately the possessed die, the street people wander away, and the survivors are rescued, relieved that the evil has been thwarted. At the end of the film, Marsh has the recurring dream again, except now an apparently possessed Danforth is the figure emerging from the building. Marsh appears to awaken, rolling over to find a gruesomely disfigured Danforth lying in bed with him. Marsh awakens, screaming, and then recovers enough to approach his bedroom mirror, hand outstretched. The film cuts to black just before his fingers touch the mirror.'] ["Newly released from a mental hospital, Jessica , accompanied by her husband  and a friend , retreats to a Victorian farmhouse in an isolated part of rural Connecticut.

Anna tells Crowe that everything is second to his work. The two then discover that they are not alone; a young man appears brandishing a gun. He says that he does not want to be afraid anymore and accuses Crowe of failing him. Crowe recognizes him as Vincent Gray , a former patient whom he treated as a child for hallucinations. Gray shoots Crowe in the abdomen, and seconds later kills himself with the gun. The next autumn, Crowe begins working with another patient, nine-year-old Cole Sear , who has a condition similar to Vincent\'s. Crowe becomes dedicated to the boy, though he is haunted by doubts over his ability to help him after his failure with Vincent. Meanwhile, his relationship with his wife has deteriorated to the point where she ignores him and refuses to talk to him. Crowe believes that she may be contemplating a romance with a coworker who keeps coming around the house although this elicits sadness from him not anger. Crowe also repeatedly has difficulty opening the door to his basement office. Once Crowe earns his trust, Cole eventually confides in him that he "sees dead people... walking around like regular people". One ghost who appears to Cole is an overworked wife, abused by her husband, who has slit her wrists. Another that tries to hurt Cole is only heard as a voice who pleads with Cole to let him out of a dark cupboard, then yells that he didn\'t steal "the Master\'s horse" and threatens to attack Cole. A third ghost is a boy with a large gunshot exit wound on the back of his head who asks Cole to come with him to find his father\'s gun. Though Crowe at first thinks Cole is delusional, he eventually comes to believe that Cole is telling the truth and that Vincent may have had the same ability to perceive ghosts. He suggests to Cole that he should try to find a purpose for his gift by communicating with the ghosts and perhaps aid them with their unfinished business on Earth. Cole at first does not want to since the ghosts terrify him, but he finally decides to try it. He talks to one of the ghosts, a very ill girl who appears in his bedroom and promptly vomits in his tent. He finds where the girl, Kyra Collins , lived and goes to her house during her funeral reception. Kyra died after a prolonged illness and funeral guests note that Kyra\'s younger sister is starting to get sick, too.

When Cole gives it to Kyra\'s father, the videotape shows Kyra\'s stepmother putting floor cleaner fluid in Kyra\'s food{{cite web}} while she cared for Kyra during her illness. Cole confesses his secret to his mother, Lynn . Although his mother at first does not believe him, Cole soon tells Lynn that her own mother once went to see her perform in a dance recital one night when she was a child, and that Lynn was not aware of this because her mother stayed in the back of the audience where she could not be seen. He also tells her that the answer to a question she asked when alone at her mother\'s grave, "Do I make you proud?", was "Every day". Lynn tearfully accepts this as the truth. Crowe returns to his home, where he finds his wife asleep on the couch with the couple\'s wedding video playing, not for the first time. As she sleeps, Anna\'s hand releases Malcolm\'s wedding ring , revealing to Crowe that he was actually killed by Vincent and was unknowingly dead the entire time he was working with Cole. Due to Cole\'s efforts, Crowe\'s unfinished business—rectifying his failure to understand and help Vincent—is finally complete. Recalling Cole\'s advice, Crowe speaks to his sleeping wife and fulfills the second reason he returned, saying she was "never second", and that he loves her. Letting her live her own life, he is free to leave the world of the living and Cole had learned to live with the ghosts as it had become a part of his life.'] ["The film begins at the Bodega Bay Inn, 1939.

As a means of coping with these recurring nightmares, and at the request of his girlfriend Lori, Boone is seeing psychotherapist Dr. Phillip K. Decker, who convinces Boone that he has committed a series of gruesome murders. In reality, Decker is a serial killer who dons a grotesque mask and has been murdering several families, all whom he sees as disgusting "breeders". Decker attempts to pin the blame for his killing spree on Boone. He gives Boone a bottle of lithium  and twenty four hours to turn himself in. Boone wanders the streets in a hallucinogenic haze. He is hit by a truck and taken to a hospital. In the hospital, Boone overhears the drug-addled cries of Narcisse, who is waiting for the monsters to take him to Midian. Narcisse, led to believe Boone is a messenger from Midian sent to test him, tells Boone the way, before tearing the skin from his face with a pair of razors, in order to show his "true face". Boone escapes the hospital and makes his way to Midian, an entire city standing under a massive graveyard. Boone encounters two supernatural creatures named Kinski and Peloquin who inhabit the city. Kinski says they should take him below but Peloquin states that whereas they are "Nightbreed", Boone is a "natural" and thinks he should die. Boone pleas that he is a murderer and hence belongs with the monsters, but Peloquin says he can smell innocence and confirms that Boone is innocent. Peloquin bites Boone on the shoulder intending to devour him, but Boone manages to escape and leaves the graveyard, only to run into an entire squad of police officers as Decker tries to get Boone to surrender. Boone is then gunned down by the police. At the morgue, Boone comes back to life due to Peloquin\'s bite, becoming a Nightbreed. He makes his way back to Midian where Narcisse has also returned to. Boone is schooled in the laws of Midian and is inducted into Midian\'s society by Dirk Lylesburg, the leader of the Nightbreed. Boone is then made to touch the blood of Baphomet . Lori, seeking to understand why Boone left her, resolves to investigate Midian for herself. She befriends a woman named Sheryl Anne and drives out to the cemetery. She wanders into the cemetery, leaving Sheryl Anne waiting at the car. She finds a dying creature out in the sunlight and at the pleading request of a woman named Rachel, picks it up and takes it into the shadows, where it transforms into a little girl; Rachel\'s daughter Babette. Lori asks after Boone, only to be rebuffed by Lylesburg, who assures her that Boone is now Nightbreed, and hence no longer part of her world. Lori tries to make her way into Midian but is scared off by Peloquin. As she leaves the cemetery, she is greeted by the sight of Sheryl Anne\'s body and her killer, who reveals himself as Decker. He tries to kill Lori in an attempt to bring Boone out of hiding. Decker chases Lori back into the cemetery where he knocks Lori unconscious. Before he can kill her however, Boone makes his presence known. Decker stabs him only to learn that Boone cannot be killed due to him having been transformed into a Nightbreed. Decker manages to escape and Boone takes Lori into Midian, where she regains consciousness deep inside the city. Lori is told of the history of Midian by Rachel: the monsters of lore were peaceful beings, hunted to near extinction by frightened and superstitious humans. Boone and Lori are then banished from Midian by Lylesburg. Meanwhile, Decker interrogates a local mechanic who once wanted to join the Nightbreed and learns how they can die. He then murders the residents of the hotel where Boone and Lori are staying. Boone finds the murder scene. Unable to control his thirst for blood, Boone begins to drink. The police find him and take him into custody. At Decker\'s urging, the local police and militia led by Captain Eigerman  form up a small army to attack Midian. They release a drunken priest named Ashberry, to serve them as God\'s servant in the battle. Lori, Rachel, and Narcisse race to the jail to release Boone. Lori shows Boone that she loves him even as a "monster". The four head back to Midian where Boone convinces the scared Nightbreed to fight back. During the battle, Ashberry is horrified to learn that there are women and children among the Nightbreed and tries to stop the attack but is roughly beaten down by Eigerman. Ashberry then finds the statue of Baphomet. He drops his cross and Bible and moves forward to swear allegiance, but is splashed, severely burned by the blood of Baphomet and transformed. The Nightbreed manages to fight back, but Boone learns from Lylesburg that Baphomet is going to destroy all of Midian. He tells Lylesburg to release the Berserkers, a monstrous, feral breed that were imprisoned due to their sheer insanity. Lylesburg attempts to open the cages but is killed, leaving Boone to release them. The Beserkers attack the humans furiously, turning the tide of the battle as the humans flee in fear. Boone and Decker then face each other in the burning wreckage of Midian. The two fight and Boone kills him. Boone then goes to Baphomet, who says that he has caused the end of Midian, but also that this was foretold. Baphomet charges Boone with finding a new home for the Nightbreed, and renames him Cabal. Boone makes his way out of Midian with Lori. The remaining Nightbreed meet in an old barn, and Boone says his goodbyes to Narcisse, promising that he will not forget the Nightbreed, and that he will find a place where they will all be safe. Meanwhile in the ruins of Midian, Ashberry stands in front of Decker\'s corpse and states that he wants to exact vengeance on Baphomet and the Breed. He takes some of the blood of Baphomet and pushes it into Decker\'s wound. Decker suddenly springs back to life with a scream as Ashberry chants "Hallelujah" over and over again.  In an alternate ending , the Nightbreed await Boone in a barn, whilst Boone says his goodbyes to Lori, as he must venture the world to find a new home for them, but he promises to return to her. Lori, fearing she will be elderly when the time comes, whilst Boone will retain his youth, stabs herself and dies, to force Boone into resurrecting her into another Nightbreed. At first the revival doesn\'t seem to work, but it is eventually successful. Elsewhere, Eigerman wanders the underground remains where he stumbles upon the transformed Ashberry, who desires revenge. Eigerman shares this desire, but Ashberry rejects him and kills Eigerman, and begins his hunt for the Nightbreed.'] ['The film revolves around a cadaver who seems to bring misfortune on those who come in contact with it. Although there is very little corporeal manifestation of the ghosts, people seem to die when they enrage the spirit which is linked with a special cadaver - by disrespecting it or otherwise. The story takes place mostly inside a hospital, where a young female med student, Alison Blanchard, comes to learn anatomy. By observing the cadaver she was assigned, she discovers that the body had self-inflicted wounds and also had a child. She soon discovers that there is something wrong with the cadaver, which they have nicknamed "Norma." Mysterious deaths occur in the hospital, which include the fiance of one of Allison\'s team members and several hospital employees. It is revealed that the cadaver is a person named Alita Covas, who once led an archaeological expedition on an Aztec sacrificial site. There she uncovered 50,000 bodies which were offered to Tlazolteotl, the Aztec god of fertility and prostitution. Afterwards, she herself became a prostitute, and started showing symptoms of mental imbalance. Later in her life, she committed murders and was subsequently put in a mental asylum where she died - presumably by her own hand. Once Alison learns of the true nature of the cadaver, she decides the corpse must return to Brazil to satisfy the Aztec god. After a series of gruesome events, Alison and her classmate/love interest take Alita\'s now dismembered corpse and cremate her in the hospital. In the end, Alison heads to Brazil to spread the ashes in an attempt to put the spirit at rest; however, it is suggested in the final scene that the spirit remains in the hospital.'] ['Brandon Sinclair brings out his ouija board at a party and attempts to contact David, the spirit of a ten-year-old boy with whom he has communicated numerous times.

Her mother comes to wake her up and finds an old binder of letters from the 19th century, as well as an old doll. The letters are from a previous occupant of the house, warning the mother that if she is reading the letters, and noticing supernatural happenings, then the unthinkable has come to pass. The movie then switches to the early 19th century, to a village that used to stand around the house, and the story of the Bell Witch is told. John Bell is taken to church court, having been accused of stealing a woman\'s land. The church finds him guilty of charging her too much interest, but lets him go because "the loss of his good name is punishment enough". The offended woman, Kate Batts, who is infamous in the village over claims of witchcraft, tells him to enjoy his good health and the health of his family while he can, scaring him. Soon after that, strange things start happening. John Bell sees a rabid black wolf that keeps disappearing, and his youngest daughter, Betsy, hears noises in her room, as if there was someone in it. She then has terrible nightmares about a little girl in a red dress and an evil entity that always comes into her bedroom after everyone else is asleep. At first, everyone thinks they are just nightmares but then the family sees Betsy suspended above the floor by unseen hands, and watch as something seems to slap her across the face. John Bell believes that Kate Batts has cursed him. Betsy starts to look very sick in class, and her schoolmaster, Professor Richard Powell, who has an interest in her, notices. He learns of what the Bells have been experiencing, and as an educated man, initially tries to justify the incidents with reality, and tries to convince them that what they saw was their illusion. He offers to stay the night at their house to dispel their fears. The haunting gets worse, and chairs, books, and people are pulled around by some entity. As they try to read from the Bible to scare it off, the Bible is thrown to the ground and the pages are ripped out. Soon the family finds blood on Betsy\'s dresses in the morning – it appears to be blood due to the loss of her virginity. Betsy is dragged around the house, and the spirit rapes her at one point. John Bell begins to get sick, and sees ghosts as well. The mother begs Professor Powell to marry her daughter and take her away to live with him. He says that although he is smitten with Betsy, he cannot marry her just to protect her. John Bell begins to go insane, and goes to Kate Batts\' house, asking her to kill him. She tells him, "I didn\'t curse you, you cursed yourself", and does not kill him. John stumbles into the forest, falls to his knees, holds the gun to his head, and pulls the trigger. The hammer clicks, but the gun doesn\'t fire. Betsy finally has a revelation: the attacks on her and her father are caused by a supernatural being who was born out of her innocence , and the reason for them was for her to "remember". She needed to remember that the true cause of her pain was that her father has sexually abused her. Lucy, Betsy\'s mother, has the same revelation, as she had witnessed the assault herself. Both had apparently repressed the incident. John Bell is coughing in bed, and a girl\'s hand is seen pouring cough medicine into a spoon and bringing it to his mouth. He takes the medicine, chokes and then dies. The girl who gave him the medicine is Betsy; her mother is watching as Betsy poisons her father. Betsy is then seen at her father\'s grave, and the narrator says that Betsy was never haunted from that point forward. The story then returns to present day, where the young girl\'s mother has been reading the journal. An old photograph that appears to be a wedding portrait of Richard Powell and Betsy is shown on a shelf. As she finishes reading, her daughter comes to her, saying that her father  has come to take her for a weekend stay with him. She sends her daughter to her ex-husband, who is waiting outside. Returning to her house, Betsy\'s apparition suddenly appears in front of her and cries "Help her!" then disappears. Shocked for a couple of seconds, the mother suddenly realizes that Betsy is trying to warn her that something is amiss between her daughter and her ex-husband. Instantly, she runs out of her house, only to catch a glimpse of her daughter\'s worried face as she and her father drive away in his car; it is thus implied that her father has already begun abusing her. The film ends with the mother running after the father\'s car.'] ["The film introduces a circle of youths who are addicted to playing Hellworld, an online computer game based on the Hellraiser series.

Nancy goes further by causing her abusive stepfather to have a heart attack and die. Nancy becomes greedy for power and encourages the others to join her in a rite called "Invocation of the Spirit". On completion of the spell, she is struck by lightning. Afterward she lacks empathy and begins taking risks with her life and those of others. The spells that the girls have cast soon begin to show negative consequences: Bonnie becomes aggressively narcissistic; Rochelle finds Laura Lizzie traumatized by her baldness and sobbing hysterically; Chris attempts to rape Sarah when she rejects his continual advances. In retaliation, Nancy uses her power to kill Chris. Sarah performs a binding spell to prevent Nancy from doing more harm, but this does not work and the coven turns on Sarah. They invade her dreams, threaten her and use their powers of illusion to make Sarah believe that her father has been killed in an accident. They taunt her with visions of swarms of insects and snakes and try to persuade her to commit suicide, before Nancy cuts Sarah\'s wrists herself. Sarah successfully "invokes the spirit" and is able to heal herself and fight back. Sarah scares off Bonnie and Rochelle and defeats Nancy, binding her power to prevent her from doing harm. As the film closes, Nancy is committed to a psychiatric hospital.  The movie also feature a powerful deity called "Manon", who is described as far larger and more powerful than God himself.'] ['In Thailand, Chong-kwai welcomes his friends Ted, May, Kofei and April from Hong Kong. While on a tour, they see an accident on the road and start telling ghost stories when they return to Chong-kwai\'s house. Chong-kwai shows them a book titled The Ten Encounters, that describes ten ways to see ghosts and spirits. Chong-kwai had purchased the book from a strange man, who offered him a discount, saying that karma had led him to it, but Chong-kwai discovers later that he had been scammed. They can begin the "game" on any of the ten methods, but must complete it or else they will be haunted forever. Out of curiosity, the five of them start playing. They start with the spirit glass game but only Kofei sees the ghost. Chong-kwai\'s mother, a spiritualist, appears and warns them about meddling with the supernatural. The next step involves them going to a road intersection at night to attract hungry ghosts. All except May are able to see the spirits, and the frustrated May insists that they continue the game even though they are already freaked out. They go to a forest to play hide and seek with a black cat, that will supposedly break the charm and allow them to see the missing person. However, Kofei had disappeared mysteriously and the cat is found dead. In anguish, April tries rubbing dirt from a grave onto her eyes, but they fall out from the sockets and turn fiery-red. She sinks into unconsciousness and Chong-kwai\'s mother saves her by cleaning her eyes, warning her that she was very close to the purgatory world. Chong-kwai\'s mother tells them to leave Thailand immediately but April stays behind because she wants to find Kofei . One night, April tries one of the methods and brushes her hair in front of a mirror at night. Her fate is uncertain. Meanwhile, back in Hong Kong, Ted and May continue to experience weird encounters. One rainy day, May finds an umbrella held by an invisible being while in the subway and she runs away. On the bus, her umbrella suddenly opens and she sees a basketball rolling back and forth. She steps over it and it turns into a human head, that starts biting her ankle. She screams in horror but her fellow passengers tell her that it is only a ball. While she is back at her apartment corridor, she sees the ball again and it starts to follow her. She performs a "peek-a-stoop" and sees a boy with a rotting face dribbling the ball. She dashes into her apartment in fear and calls Ted to come. While waiting for him, she receives a call about April\'s disappearance. Ted encounters many spirits on the way to May\'s apartment and he kicks the ball in the corridor and is possessed by the ghost. He jerks and twists his body and appears to be breakdancing. A pair of gangsters see Ted and think he is challenging them to a breakdance battle. Ted starts to walk on the wall and stand on the ceiling, while the horrified dancers and observers flee. Ted recovers and grabs a girl in the hallway, telling her to follow him into May\'s apartment, but she is nowhere to be seen later. After watching a video recording, they realize that the girl is actually the victim of the accident they saw in Thailand and her spirit disappears after Ted "peek-a-stoop" to see her. Back in Thailand, Chong-kwai visits the bookstore to get answers from the man who sold him the cursed book. He sees that the drawings of characters in the book have been replaced by images of himself and his friends. His mother pulls him away before he can find out anything. At the same time, Ted and May return to Thailand to complete the game, hoping that the curse will be broken after doing so. They perform the last step, which is, to sleep while dressed in traditional garments for the deceased.

He is shot and killed by an assassin wearing a rabbi\'s outfit, who then takes the computer disk containing the code. Following this, two mysterious men take a page out of Rostenburg\'s sweater and keep it. The scene shifts to the back stage of a talk show, hosted by Cassandra Barashe , where Dr. Gillian Lane , an author and speaker, is getting ready to go onto the stage. On the show he explains that Old Testament is a passage to our past, present, and future. After the show, he returns home and visits his ex-wife and daughter on the latter\'s birthday. Stone Alexander ([[Michael York  is then shown speaking at a peace ceremony in Rome on how he has fed the hungry in Africa with water and food wafers. Dr. Lane attends as well and the two "enjoy some fine champagne and to support a worthy cause." It is revealed to the audience that the man who killed the rabbi in the beginning is Stone\'s apprentice, Dominic . Dr. Lane meets with Cassandra, and the two form an alliance. Lane and Stone maks a worldwide tour of goodwill such as one related to the establishment of the Palestinian state. Stone also makes a seven-year peace treaty with the Palestinians and the Israelis before moving on to other regions of the globe. In the meantime, Lane\'s family is shown not being able to see him because of his busy schedule. After three-and-a-half years, Lane discovers that Stone had been using the computer code that was shown in the beginning of the movie. This code is based on what is called the 3-D study of the Bible, where prophetic messages are revealed. Stone and his bodyguard find Lane, and Stone asks him to be his prophet. Dominic in an anger at being left pulls out his gun and tried to kill Lane, but instead shoots Stone. Dominic lies stating that Lane shot Stone, which leads to a worldwide manhunt. People around the world hold funerals for Stone. Lane, meanwhile, is about to take off in an airplane when he remembers what Rostenburg said about the Torah containing the genetic code of the universe. Satan enters Stone\'s body so he can continue the plans. Later in the movie, Stone obtains the final code via tempting Cassandra. Stone proclaims himself king and God at a coronation. This angers the two prophets, who denounce Stone. When he demands that they "show us all a sign" one responds "It is a wicked and perverse generation who asks for a sign. But like Christ, your only sign will be this: destroy these temples of His holy prophets and the Lord will rebuild them in three days!" To that, Stone says "It will be my pleasure!" They are then killed by Dominic while Stone says to keep them on display to show what will happen if anyone who defies him, invoking a general protest from both Muslims and Jews. Alexander manages to leave via helicopter, vowing to make an example of Jerusalem. Meanwhile, the last code is shown to be a fake . Stone then leads armies against Jerusalem as it is the first to withdraw from the global alliance. The two prophets are resurrected. Lane appears with the code. Stone lies that he\'ll call off the attack if Lane will enter the final code. Lane does so. Stone is about to commence the destruction of Jerusalem, "On my mark, three, two, and—" when a bright light appears from heaven, sending Satan back to where he came from, leaving Stone dead again. The film closes as we see what the final code said from the start of the movie: Dawn of New Millennium.'] ['After miraculously recovering from a bullet wound to the head, Gulf War veteran Jack Starks  returns to Vermont in 1992, suffering from periods of amnesia. While walking, he sees a young girl, Jackie , and her mother  in despair beside their broken-down truck. Starks and Jackie quickly form a certain affinity; she asks him to give her his dogtags and he does so. He gets the truck started for them and continues on his way. Shortly after, a man driving along the same highway gives Jack a ride and they get pulled over by a policeman. The scene changes: Starks is found lying on the deserted roadside near the dead policeman, with a slug from the policeman\'s gun in his body. The murder weapon is on the ground nearby. Although he testifies there was someone else at the scene, he is not believed because of his amnesia. Starks is found not guilty by reason of insanity and is incarcerated in a mental institution. Starks is subjected to the experiments of Dr. Thomas Becker , a psychiatrist. In December 1992 Starks is injected with experimental drugs, forcibly bound in a straitjacket and then placed inside a morgue drawer as a form of sensory deprivation. While in this condition, he is somehow able to travel 15 years into the future and stay there for a short time. He meets an older version of Jackie  at a roadside diner where she works. This happens because it is the only memory he can ever fully hold on to. Seeing him standing forlornly, she takes pity on him and offers him shelter, just for the night. While in her apartment, Starks comes across his own dogtags and questions her. Jackie tells him that Jack Starks died on 1 January 1993 and so he cannot possibly be who he says he is. She becomes upset and asks him to leave. Subsequently, Starks is transported back to the future on several occasions in the course of his treatment and, after earning her trust, they try to figure out how to make use of the time-travelling so as to remove Jack from the hospital and save his life. Early on 1 January 1993, knowing his time is fast running out, Starks slips out of the hospital and travels to the home of Jackie and her mother. He gives the mother a letter he has written. The letter outlines Jackie\'s bleak future and warns the mother that she is fated to orphan Jackie when she falls asleep with a cigarette and is burned to death. When he returns to the hospital, Starks slips on ice and hits his head; bleeding profusely, he convinces two hospital doctors, who are sympathetic to him, to put him into the jacket one last time. Starks returns to 2007, where he finds that his letter has made all the difference. Jackie now has a better life than in the previous version of 2007 - no longer a waitress, she\'s dressed in a nurse\'s uniform and has a noticeably more cheerful outlook. They reprise their first 2007 meeting: she sees Starks standing in the snow and initially drives past him, but backs up when she notices his head wound. She stops and offers to take him to the hospital where she works. While they are in the car, Jackie receives a call from her mother — still alive and well. They drive on, the screen fades to white, and a voice-over reveals that the link to the "previous" future is not lost when Jackie says "How much time do we have?", a question she has asked him before. As the credits start to roll, the answer to the question is given by the words of the song: "We have all the time in the world".'] ['The plot involves a young English woman named Elizabeth, who, after the death of her father, travels to a convent on a remote island where her mother died after giving birth to her.

Williams and Joshua Leonard set out to produce a documentary about the fabled Blair Witch. They travel to Burkittsville, Maryland, formerly Blair, and interview locals about the legend of the Blair Witch. The locals tell them of Rustin Parr, a hermit who kidnapped seven children in the 1940s and brought them to his house in the woods, where he tortured and murdered them. Parr brought the children into his home\'s basement in pairs, forcing the first child to face the corner and listen to their companion\'s screams as he murdered the second child. Parr would then murder the first child. Eventually turning himself in to the police, Parr later pleaded insanity, saying that the spirit of Elly Kedward, a witch hanged in the 18th century, had been terrorizing him for some time and promised to leave him alone if he murdered the children. The second day, the students begin to explore the woods in north Burkittsville to look for evidence to prove it is real and the Blair Witch exists. Along the way, a fisherman warns them that the woods are haunted, and recalls a time that he had seen strange mist rising from the water. The students hike to Coffin Rock, where five men were found ritualistically murdered in the 19th century, and then camp for the night. The next day they move deeper into the woods, despite being uncertain of their exact location on the map. They eventually locate what appears to be an old cemetery with seven small cairns. They set up camp nearby and then return to the cemetery after dark. Josh accidentally disturbs a cairn, and Heather hastily repairs it. Later, they hear crackling sounds in the darkness that seem to be coming from all directions and assume the noises are from animals or locals following them. The following day they attempt to return to their vehicle, but can\'t find their way. They try until nightfall, when they are forced to set camp. That night, they again hear crackling noises, but can\'t see anything. The next morning they find three cairns have been built around their tent during the night. As they continue trying to find their way out of the woods, Heather realizes that her map is missing, and Mike later reveals that he kicked it into a creek out of frustration the previous day. Josh and Heather attack Mike in a fit of intense rage. They then realize they are now hopelessly lost, and decide to simply "head south". Soon, they discover a multitude of humanoid stick figures suspended from trees. That night, they hear more strange noises, including the sounds of children and bizarre "morphing" sounds. When an unknown force shakes the tent, they flee in a panic and hide in the woods until dawn. Upon returning to their tent, they find that their possessions have been rifled through, and Josh\'s equipment is covered with slime, causing them to question why only his belongings were affected. As the day wears on, they pass a log over a stream that was identical to the one they had passed earlier, despite having traveled directly south all day, and again set camp, completely demoralized at having wasted the entire day seemingly going in circles. The next morning, Josh has disappeared. After trying in vain to find him, Mike and Heather eventually break camp and slowly move on. That night, they hear Josh screaming in the darkness, but are not able to find him. The next morning, Heather finds a bundle of sticks and fabric outside their tent. Later inspection reveals it contains blood-soaked scraps of Josh\'s shirt, as well as teeth and hair, but she does not mention this to Mike. That day, Heather films herself apologizing to the co-producers of her project as well as her family, and breaks down crying and hyperventilating, believing that something terrible is hunting her and her friends. Later, they again hear Josh\'s agonized cries for help, but this time they follow them and discover a derelict abandoned house in the woods. Mike races upstairs, following the voice, while Heather tries to follow. Mike then claims he hears Josh in the basement. He follows the sound and, after what seems to be a struggle, goes silent and drops to the floor. Heather screams for Mike, but gets no answer. She then enters the basement looking for both men, and her camera catches a glimpse of Mike facing the wall. Heather then screams as she and her camera drop to the floor. There is only silence as the footage ends.'] ['{{Plot}} Claire Spencer  is living in Vermont with her husband, renowned scientist Dr. Norman Spencer . A year previously, Claire had been involved in a serious car accident that leaves gaps in her memory. Combined with her daughter Caitlin\'s  departure for college, this leaves Claire profoundly affected. The Spencers — who have moved into the former home of Norman\'s father — live next door to the Feurs, who have just moved in and often have loud arguments. Overhearing Mary Feur  sobbing one day, Claire becomes concerned. When she sees Mary\'s husband Warren  seemingly dragging something that resembles a body bag in the middle of the night and putting it in the trunk of the car, she suspects that Mary has been murdered. Claire decides to investigate. After nobody answers the door, she walks around the side of the house and discovers a woman\'s sandal with a dark stain on it. She steals the sandal as evidence. Back on the doorstep, she is surprised by Warren, whose surly behavior further arouses her suspicion. Claire begins spying on Warren with the help of her best friend Jody . However, Claire soon witnesses strange occurrences when she is alone in the house — pictures fall, doors open, and a shadowy reflection is seen in her bathwater. Claire becomes convinced that Mary is dead and haunting her. Desperate for closure, and facing little sympathy from Norman, Claire invites Jody to join her for a séance in her bathroom, where she seems to be able to communicate with Mary\'s ghost. Claire produces the sandal for the ritual; after it starts, the dial on the Ouija board starts to show the words "M E F" on the screen. However, the séance is cut short after being interrupted by Cooper, their Saint Bernard dog. Claire and Jody initially assume the séance has been a nonsensical exercise; however, after Jody leaves, Claire returns to the bathroom to find the tub filled. This time she sees the ghost in the mirror, Claire asks the ghost what it wants. It replies with a message on a clouded mirror: "YOU KNOW". An anxious Claire goes to Norman\'s office to inform him of the séance. While traveling through Norman\'s campus, Claire encounters Warren and hysterically accuses him of killing his wife. But Warren responds with confusion before Mary—very much alive—joins him. When Mary speaks with Claire later, she explains that she had left Warren and that he had been packing her belongings when Claire saw him. The Spencers assume that the ordeal is over, but later a picture breaks in Norman\'s study. Picking it up, Claire notices a newspaper clipping about a missing girl named Madison Elizabeth Frank . She learns that Madison attended the university where Norman was a lecturer. While visiting Madison\'s mother she steals a braid of Madison\'s hair. Reading from a book on the supernatural given to her by Jody, Claire uses the hair to perform a ritual that allows Madison to possess her and seduce Norman. But Claire morphs into Madison during the tryst, causing Norman to push her away. Claire\'s memory returns, and she remembers that she had caught Norman and Madison together the night of her car accident. Outraged by Norman\'s infidelity, Claire spends the night with Jody, who confirms to Claire her suspicion of Norman\'s affair after seeing him and Madison together in a small cafe in the town of Adamant; unseen by Norman, Jody keeps this information to herself until she confesses to Claire. Norman eventually confesses: he had a brief relationship with Madison, but realized that he loved Claire too much to leave her, causing the unstable Madison to threaten to kill Claire. He then visited Madison to find her dead of an overdose. He pushed Madison\'s car  into the lake. Claire urges Norman to contact the authorities, and he agrees to do so. He speaks with the police on the phone, and then leaves to take a shower. Suspicious of her husband, Claire redials the phone and discovers that he had not really called the police. Norman suddenly grabs her from behind and sedates her. He drags her to the bathtub, which is still running, and places her in the rising water. Norman then explains to Claire that Madison was planning on going to the college\'s Dean about their affair, and he could not let that happen, so he killed her and pushed Madison\'s car and body into the lake. Norman then tells Claire he hopes her death will bring him closer to Caitlin who looks so much like her. Norman leans over Claire\'s paralyzed body to give her one final kiss. While doing so, he notices that she is wearing a pendant around her neck. When he picks up Claire\'s head to adjust it her face suddenly morphs into the corpse-like face of Madison. He is startled and jumps back, slipping on the wet floor, and hitting his head on the sink; which leaves him bloody and unconscious on the floor. Claire, recovering from the sedative, crawls out of the bathtub and down the stairs. The phone has been disconnected, so she tries to drive somewhere that will have better reception. Norman, only stunned, chases her and jumps into the truck. A ghostlike figure appears in the road, which Claire swerves to avoid, and she drives off the bridge into the same lake into which Norman pushed Madison\'s car. Underwater, Norman grabs Claire\'s leg, but Madison\'s decaying body, disturbed by debris falling from the car, floats up, grabs Norman, and forces him to release Claire\'s leg so she can swim to the surface. Norman drowns while staring into the dead face of the woman he killed. Madison\'s body floats to the surface of the lake. The following winter, Claire is seen placing a single red rose on Madison\'s grave. The camera pans out and an image of Madison\'s face is seen in the snow.'] ["Sam Wheat , a banker, and Molly Jensen , a talented potter, are a loving couple who move into a New York City apartment.

His apparent twin  smoothly assures him that he has nothing to fear. He's a doppelganger. Bemused, Hayasaki invites him to his home. He eventually notices that while his doppelganger is identical to his looks, mannerisms and speech, the doppelganger's personality and attitude are drastically different from his own. Where he's too timid to get what he wants, his doppelganger has no qualms in getting what it wants. Where he's too afraid to speak out, his doppelganger speaks its mind. Where he's moderate with drinking, the doppelganger indulges heavily. Where he's detail-oriented, it doesn't pay much attention to details as it's more concerned with the end result. As his doppelganger removes all sources of Hayasaki's stress, reorganises his life for better, acquires all things he's yielded for, does rebellious things Hayasaki couldn't do, and assists with building the robotic chair that frustrates him for so long, Hayasaki learns to enjoy his doppelganger's seemingly nihilistic actions. He soon wonders whether his doppelganger has an agenda when he realises he's being dragged into madness."] ["The film picks up after the second films events and reveals Jake  has been placed in a mental asylum after the events of the second film under the care of Dr. Sullivan, his caretaker.

She explains that Jake has died and that he told her stories of a woman with long black hair and dead white skin, along with a little boy that killed the rest of his family, which she believes to be a fantasy Jake made up because he couldn't deal with the facts. She also mentions that he had hallucinations about her and the boy, but this time the hallucination broke every bone in his body. Lisa confirms that her sister has also seen the same little boy, making Dr. Sullivan finally believe that Jake's delusions were true. The next day, Dr. Sullivan leaves with Lisa after Jake's funeral and goes back to her office, where she tells her a story about the Saeki family, the family Jake described in his  hallucinations. Back in the apartment Gretchen is seen painting a portrait of Rose in her room with classical music on, and while washing her paintbrushes in her sink she hears a noise in her room and encounters a can of red paint spilled on the floor and Gretchen's painting shredded up, she picks up the portrait and it quickly flashes Kayako's face, Gretchen drops it in horror and the red paint starts to make handprints and Kayako crawls out of another painting and crawls over to Gretchen who is backing up in horror and eventually gouges out her eyes and rips off her jaw.

During the ceremony, Naoko warns that it must not be interrupted or the curse will continue. She begins the ceremony and tells Rose that she must drink Kayako's blood to contain the curse. Lisa is afraid and tells Naoko that she will not allow Rose to do this. Unfortunately, the ceremony is interrupted when Takeo, as Max, realizes what Naoko is attempting to accomplish.

At the same time, Lisa is chased by Kayako and trapped in the bathroom, where she discovers Andy. As she holds the lifeless corpse, it turns into Kayako and she is backed against the wall. Rose hears her sister's screams, and just as Kayako is about to kill Lisa, Rose drinks Kayako's blood, causing Kayako's curse to disappear. Lisa rushes to her sister's aid bringing her back to their apartment to give her oxygen. Max - who has been exorcized of Takeo's evil possession upon Kayako's banishment - stares in horror at the body of Naoko and starts to sob at what he did. He is then attacked by Naoko's ghost as her murder has caused a new curse to begin. Naoko kills him by biting out his throat. After hearing his screams, Lisa discovers his body and calls the police. In the final scene, the corpses are brought out of the apartment building in body bags while Lisa and Rose sit in the emergency vehicle. Rose asks Lisa if they will be safe and Lisa assures her that they will be, embracing her. As the camera moves, we discover that Lisa is now hugging Kayako, who is now trapped within Rose's body. She stares at the camera, croaking, and the film ends."] ['In the Edwardian era, in a small British town, three little girls are playing tea party. Suddenly they look up and see something . Then the three girls get up and walk in a trance-like state to the window where they jump out to their death. In London Arthur Kipps , a penniless lawyer and the widowed father of four-year-old Joseph, is charged by his office to obtain the paperwork with which to sell a large manor – the bleak, isolated and desolate Eel Marsh House. Though he is hesitant to leave his son alone with a nanny, Arthur\'s boss warns him that if he fails to complete his duty he will lose his job. Arthur is treated coldly upon his arrival and is barely able to get a room for the night, but he meets a kind local man named Samuel Daily  and his wife Elisabeth  who allow him to stay at their home. Arthur visits his legal contact, Mr. Jerome, who hurries him off with a stack of papers, telling him to return to London. Instead, Arthur pays the coachman to take him to Eel Marsh House, where he feels he will be able to more thoroughly complete his work. While there he is distracted by odd noises, footsteps and finally a brief appearance by a woman dressed in black. Arthur then hears a commotion in Eel Marsh, and runs out only to find his coachman waiting for him. As Arthur reports the incident to the police, three children come into the station; two boys carrying their very pale little sister who had just drank lye. She subsequently collapses in Arthur\'s arms and dies. That night, Sam reveals that he and his wife lost their son in a drowning accident, and Elisabeth – who has lost her mind with grief – carves a figure into the table of someone being hanged before she is sedated by Sam and their butler.

Elisabeth then indicates that Joseph, who is being brought to the town by his nanny the next day, is a target for the Woman in Black. In an attempt to lift the curse, Arthur decides to reunite Nathaniel and Jennet by finding Nathaniel\'s body in the marsh with Sam\'s help. They place his body in the Eel Marsh House, where Jennet finds him lying in his planned nursery bed and it appears to Arthur that she is satisfied. However, she is unable to hold him, presumably because he doesn\'t feel the same connection. Arthur and Sam then place Jennet\'s son in the grave with her before covering it back up. The next night, Joseph and Arthur are reunited and intend on immediately returning to London, but Joseph slips away while Arthur and Sam are busy talking. Arthur soon notices the Woman in Black on the other side of the station, and Joseph walking along the train tracks under her command, and it becomes apparent that the curse will never be lifted.

Knowing he cannot escape, Charles takes cover inside a seemingly old toy store. He looms around until he falls on a stack of "Good Guy" themed dolls. He uses a voodoo ritual to transfer his soul into one of the dolls. The store is then struck by lightning and catches on fire; sending Mike flying unexpectedly across the store, although much of its inventory, including the dolls, survives. The detective isn\'t injured, and walks over to Charles, who lies deceased next to the doll. Later that morning, 6-year-old Andy Barclay ([[Alex Vincent  tells his mother Karen Barclay  that he wants a Good Guy doll for his birthday. Unable to afford the doll at full price, Karen buys a doll from a street peddler. That night, as Andy is playing with the doll – who has introduced himself as "Chucky",  – Karen\'s friend, Maggie Peterson , who is babysitting Andy, scolds him for turning on the evening news and placing Chucky in front of the TV. When Andy tries to deny the accusation , she doesn\'t believe him and sends him to bed. A small like figure is seen toying with Maggie, ultimately causing her to go into the kitchen. Maggie is violently struck with a hammer and falls out of the kitchen window, falling several stories to her death. Andy, when questioned by Mike Norris, who had killed Charles Lee Ray earlier that day, insists that Chucky has revealed himself to be alive and that he killed Maggie. Karen is very upset at Mike for questioning Andy. The next day, Andy skips school with Chucky and takes a subway train to the house of Eddie Caputo , Charles Lee Ray\'s getaway driver, who had left him to die after he was pursued by Jack Santos, also known as Mario , Mike Norris\'s partner. Chucky sneaks into Eddie\'s house and blows out the pilot light on the stove and turns up the gas. Eddie discovers that Charles is in the house, and, in panicked self-defense, fires his gun in the kitchen and the house explodes, killing him. Authorities place Andy in a psychiatric ward after he is found near the crime scene. Karen discovers Andy was telling the truth after discovering that the included batteries in the Good Guy doll box were never put inside the "working" doll. After threatening to throw him in the fireplace, Chucky comes alive in her hands , yells explectives at her, bites her, and runs out of the apartment. She then proceeds to contact Mike Norris. Although he initially doubts her story, the homeless man who sold Karen the doll confirms to Mike that he retrieved it from the burnt down toy store where Charles Lee Ray was killed, but not without asking for an offering first, in which Karen didn\'t have much to offer, so the homeless man attempted to rape her as an alternative, but she was saved by Mike. The detective becomes a believer after he is attacked by Chucky in his car and survives only by shooting the doll. Chucky meets John Simonsen , his voodoo instructor when he was younger, showing off his new body. Chucky then asks why his gunshot wound bled, since he should not bleed. John informs him that his body is slowly transforming to that of a human\'s and will soon become entirely flesh and blood, trapping him within it. Chucky demands to know how to avoid such a fate, but John, feeling Chucky has abused his voodoo knowledge, refuses to help. Having anticipated this, Chucky tortures him via a pre-prepared voodoo doll, and John admits Chucky can escape the doll body if he transfers his soul into the body of the first person he revealed his true nature to, which is Andy. Laughing that he will "get to be six years old again," a perfect disguise for a killer, Chucky stabs the voodoo doll and leaves John to die. Karen and Mike, following leads from Charles Lee Ray\'s case file, find John as he lies dying and receive instructions on how to kill Chucky; although Chucky is a doll, his heart is fully human and vulnerable to fatal injury. Knowing that Chucky is chasing him, Andy escapes from the psychiatric unit. Chucky brutally kills Dr. Ardmore  with an electroshock machine, leaving the authorities to believe Andy killed Dr. Ardmore while escaping. Mike and Karen rush back to the apartment hoping that Andy is there. Chucky reaches the apartment before them and knocks Andy unconscious with a baseball bat, then tries to begin the voodoo ritual to transfer his soul to Andy. After a prolonged struggle, Chucky is thrown into the fireplace by Karen and, despite some coaxing by Chucky, Andy manages to light a match and ignite the fireplace, ultimately burning Chucky alive. Andy and Karen, thinking that Chucky is dead, go to help an injured Mike, Karen telling Andy to get the first aid kit under the sink. After Andy gets the first aid kit from under the sink, he discovers Chucky is gone. Very burnt, but alive, Chucky chases after Andy and Karen, who barricade themselves in the bedroom. Karen shoots him several times, missing his heart, but scattering his head, an arm, and a leg in the hallway. After Mike\'s partner, Jack Mario, arrives, the scattered doll parts attack Mario at the instructions of Chucky\'s screaming, severed head. Karen, remembering John\'s last words, tells Mike to shoot Chucky in the heart. Mike does so and makes a direct hit, killing Chucky. Mike and Mario then acknowledge that no one will believe them. The film ends with Andy looking back at Chucky\'s remains as he, Karen, Mike, and Mario go out to the ambulance.'] ["The film begins with two men on their motorcycles driving away from Pumpkinhead.

After apparently spending two years comatose in a hospital, Mike has a near death experience, in which his brother Jody appears and tells him he\'s not ready to cross over into the light. Mike walks on but the Tall Man stands in his way causing him to wake up. Just as Reggie arrives, Mike is attacked by a demon nurse but fights her off. A sphere emerges from her head and crashes out through the window. Back at home, Jody appears again to warn Mike but the Tall Man arrives via dimension fork, fights off Reggie and Jody  and draws Mike through the gate with him. The next morning, Reggie  travels to Holtsville, which turns out to be deserted. Reggie is captured by three looters who lock him in his Cuda\'s trunk and drive on to another house. There they are attacked and killed by a little boy named Tim, who also releases Reggie. After they have buried three looters in the yard, Tim tells Reggie how the Tall Man took his parents and destroyed the town.

Reg tries to warn them but the sphere kills Tanesha, as well as damaging Rocky\'s nunchaku. Tim appears and shoots it out of the air with his pistol. The three join forces and drive on, looking for a town called Boulton, which contains a large mortuary. On their way the come across a convoy of hearses driven by gravers and follow them.

While Reggie, Rocky and Tim are separately attacked by the looters, Mike consults with the Jody-sphere, who explains that the Tall Man is amassing an army to conquer dimensions. He also shows him in a dream what the Tall Man does with the dwarf creatures he has created from the dead: he removes the sapient part of the brains to create the spheres, turning the body into a drone and the mind into a killer. The Tall Man senses their presence and before they can leave, and paralyzes Mike. Surrounded by hundreds of spheres, the Tall Man reaches for Mike, who wakes up and finds himself strapped to the table. The Tall Man grabs and subdues the Jody-sphere and welcomes Mike. Soon after, two of the looters, Rufus and Henry, wheel in Tim. Mike tries to give a message to the boy, saying "There are thousands of them", but is paralyzed beyond speech by the Tall Man.

Cut free by the Jody-sphere, Tim runs into the remaining looters who are killed by the Jody-sphere and Reggie\'s 4-barrel shotgun. The trio crash into the embalming room, where the Tall Man has begun operating on Mike. Rocky impales the Tall Man with a spear dipped in liquid nitrogen, causing his flesh to begin melting. Rocky and Reggie lock him into the refrigerator room. A golden sphere breaks out of his head, crashes outside and chases through the corridors. Surprised by the golden sphere, Reggie catches it with a plunger and is almost overpowered by it. With help from Rocky and Tim, he submerges the sphere in the nitrogen tank neutralizing it. In the meantime, Mike climbs from the table and sees yellow blood issuing from his wound. He looks into a mirror and sees a golden sphere in his own head, concealed his torn skin. Just after the Tall Man\'s sphere has been dumped into the nitrogen, Mike appears, showing silver eyeballs, complaining of the cold and walking outside. Reggie chases after him but Mike warns him to stay away. Jody leaves as well telling Reggie that they\'ll be in touch. Reggie suggests searching the mortuary but Rocky leaves having had enough of dealing with the undead. Reggie and Tim go back inside and Tim reports that Mike said that "There are thousands of them." Unknown to them, dozens of spheres are hovering above them. In the next room, Tim finds the poles of the dimension fork and the nitrogen tank overturned. He goes back to find Reggie pinned to the wall by force of the spheres. Tim tries to get his gun but a new Tall Man reappears and watches as Tim is pulled through a window by a creature followed by the sound of him getting torn apart and devoured, continuing the films\' trademark ending.'] ['16-year-old Katie Embry  and 17-year-old Becca Kotler  are bored at home and watching TV.

After waking from a particularly jarring nightmare, Rachel is horrified to discover Aidan watching the tape. Panicked, she calls Noah, revealing that Noah is Aidan\'s father. Rachel goes to the Morgan house and finds Richard, who refuses to talk about the video or his daughter and sends Rachel away. A local doctor tells Rachel that Anna could not carry a baby to term and adopted a child named Samara . Dr. Grasnik  recounts that Anna soon complained about gruesome visions that only happened when Samara was around, so both were sent to a mental institution. While Rachel is investigating on Moesko Island, Noah is investigating the institution, where he finds Anna\'s file and discovers that there was a video of Samara, but the video is missing. Back at the ranch, Rachel sneaks back to the Morgan house where she discovers a box containing the missing video and a live centipede that was shown in Samara\'s tape. Rachel watches it, and is confronted by Richard who claims that she and her son will die, and that there is nothing they can do about it. He then electrocutes himself in the bathtub, sending Rachel running out of the room screaming. Noah arrives and, with Rachel, goes to the barn to discover an attic where Samara was kept by her father. Behind the wallpaper they discover an image of a tree seen on the tape, which grows near the Shelter Mountain Inn. At the inn, they discover a well underneath the floor, in which Rachel finds Samara\'s skeletal corpse, experiencing a vision of how her mother pushed her into it. Rachel notifies the authorities and, feeling sorry for Samara, gives her a proper burial. Rachel informs Aidan that they will no longer be troubled by Samara. However, Aidan is horrified, telling his mother she had freed her body, and that Samara "never sleeps" and that she was not supposed to help Samara. While he says this, his nose begins to bleed. In his apartment, Noah\'s TV turns on, revealing an image in which a decaying Samara crawls from the well and out of the TV into the room. Horrified, Noah trips backward and tries to crawl away from Samara. Samara faces him, exposes her true face and stares directly at him, killing him with fear, which Rachel discovers after racing to his apartment and seeing his face distorted like Katie\'s was. Upon returning to her apartment, Rachel destroys and burns the original tape. Wondering why she had not died like the others, she remembers that she made a copy of the tape. Rachel realizes the only way to escape and save Aidan is to have him copy the tape and show it to someone else, continuing the cycle. Rachel helps Aidan copy the tape, who asks her what is going to happen to the person they give the tape to. She does not respond as a shot of the well is shown in the tape. Then the screen goes to black static and ends with a few pictures from the tape.'] [" An antiques dealer discovers that a dancer's musical spirit possesses an old drum in her shop.

As she dies, she drops an ornate black envelope. A year later, former college friends Sid ([[Marcus Thomas , Kira , and Harris  go out drinking after a funeral. They break into the Crescent View Cemetery to say their final goodbyes to the departed. Continuing their revelries, they get quite drunk. Sid finds a black envelope tucked behind a garland of flowers at the grave. It contains a poem urging those present to be joyful and to dance upon the graves. In their drunken state, the three regard this as a celebration of life, and they dance. Soon enough, mysterious things begin to happen. Harris and his wife Allison  are frightened by unexpected visions and odd sounds. Then Kira is attacked by a demonic force. She is severely bitten and sexually assaulted, and her house is ransacked. Sid is plagued by unexpected fires. They enlist a pair of paranormal investigators, Vincent Cochet  and Frances Culpepper , who determine that the three inadvertently invoked a powerful curse by dancing on the graves. They are now being haunted by three wayward spirits - a passionate axe murderer, a child pyromaniac, and a serial killer and rapist - who will kill them at the next full moon. As the full moon approaches, they return to the cemetery to disinter the remains of their tormenters, hoping to bury them anew and put the curse to rest. Not all of the critical parts make it back into the ground, however, and on the final night the three experience renewed attacks, more powerful and furious than any to date. They are trapped together, with the investigators, by the malevolent spirits, who move in to take their revenge. Sid is incinerated by his firebug ghost; Kira is murdered and her body is possessed by the axe murderer who is pursuing Harris. Under duress, Culpepper admits that she foiled the burial plan by hiding the skulls of the corpses, the better to gather hard evidence of ghostly activity. Harris takes the skull for his ghost, hoping to place it in a grave which Vincent has conveniently left open in the yard as a safety measure and break the curse at the last moment. He helps Allison escape the house through an attic window, and she crashes back in, through the outside fence and walls, in Vincent's Humvee, which was also parked in the yard. The spiritual force in the house coalesces and takes the form of a demonic head, which chases after the fleeing Humvee, shattering interior walls as it comes. After a near brush with defeat, the final skull is at last put in its resting place, and the energy of the raging ghosts disappears. Finally, Allison and Harris walk through the cemetery after the funerals of their friends. As they leave, the groundskeeper carefully places a black envelope in a familiar style on one of the tombstones."] ['High school senior Nick Powell  plans to skip his graduation and fly to London for a writing program, despite the plans his controlling mother, Diane , has for him. While he is a top performer in school and cares deeply for creative writing, his mother often pressures him to succeed past his abilities and remains emotionally distant. A few years prior, Nick\'s father died unexpectedly and the two have maintained a strained relationship in silence. Nick\'s best friend, Pete Egan , confides in him that he is bullied by Annie Newton , a troubled teen. Nick attempts to step in on one such occasion, only for it to escalate into a physical confrontation. Annie\'s closest friends are a few violent thieves, and her boyfriend, Marcus , is on parole for similar violations. Later in the day, Nick tells Pete about his plans to leave for London and the writing program there, and they share a bitter-sweet goodbye. The same evening, Annie impulsively decides to rob a jewellery store across the street from where Marcus is stealing a car. Marcus reprimands her, and later tries to take the jewels for himself, but Annie keeps them and defiantly pushes him to try and stop her. Believing Annie to be out of control, Marcus tips off the cops. Annie is arrested and assumes that Pete is responsible because he saw her load the merchandise into her locker at school. She later attempts to beat a confession out of Pete. When Annie doesn\'t believe his innocence, Pete reluctantly gives up Nick\'s name in order to stop his beating, thinking that Nick will be on a plane to London already. He does not know that Nick\'s flight schedule had changed and that he gave his ticket to a girl at a party, deciding last minute not to go. Annie and her crew find Nick walking home from a party. They run him off the road and beat him mercilessly. Annie goes too far, and believes she killed Nick. They dump his body in a nearby sewer. The next morning Nick goes to school to find that no one can see or hear him. He returns to his home to find his mother making a missing person report with the police. After a while, Nick thinks that maybe he may be alive but unconscious. As Nick comes to realize that he\'s having an out-of-body experience, he attempts to reach out to Annie and Pete in a desperate bid to save his life. He follows Annie in his new state of near death willing her to tell the police where his body is as she does not know he is still alive. Detective Larson seems close to putting together the whole truth, and implies that once he finds Annie he will be able to put the robberies and murder on Marcus. Since Marcus is still on parole, Detective Larson adds the pressure that even associating or participating in a felony could send him back to prison. Marcus decides to get involved, so he kidnaps Pete and forces him to lead him to Nick\'s body so they can move it together to another location. He then conspires to kill Annie and arranges to meet with her. Annie calls Pete to the meeting place also, who is under surveillance by the police. As Annie flees from both Marcus and the police, Nick yells at her and for the first time she turns back and responds. The two cannot hold a conversation, and Annie cannot see Nick, but she hears some of his voice in her head and has the sense that his presence is following her around. From this association, Annie begins to feel the effects of her actions on her conscience, and stops to visit Nick\'s room to get a better sense of who he is. The two realize the tragedy of their lives was that they were so similar that given different choices and events, the two could have been close. Diane catches Annie in his room, and she flees. She returns to the woods to find Nick\'s body, only to see that it has been moved. She confronts Pete, and then Marcus trying to learn the location of the body. Marcus tells her, but shoots her in the belly as she leaves. She shoots Marcus in return, then calls the police to tell them where to find Nick.

She never regrets anything in the novel and is not displayed in a sympathetic light. Also, in the novel, all the teens are 14-15, "Nick\'s" girlfriend is pregnant, and "Nick\'s" mother is not excessively controlling.'] ['On the Berlin subway, university student Cheryl is pursued by a mysterious, masked man.

As she is being born, a priest in the Vatican witnesses a comet arching over the moon, described as the "Eye of God", heralding the birth of the one chosen to be the mother of Satan\'s child. The priest is then sent on a mission by the Pope  to find and protect the girl from Satan\'s presence at all costs. However, a few Vatican Knights  insist that she must be killed to prevent Satan\'s plans, which most of the clergy  opposes, as they view that taking a life in an attempt to stop evil as sinful. Twenty years later, near the end of 1999, retired cop Jericho Cane , in a constant state of depression since his wife and daughter were murdered by hit-men, works for an elite security and protection company. He and his co-worker/friend Bobby Chicago  are assigned to protect a Wall Street banker . They are attacked by a priest named Thomas Aquinas , who is eventually captured and taken to a hospital. Unknown to Jericho, Aquinas somehow knew the real identity of the banker—he has been possessed by Satan and now wields great powers. Satan locates Aquinas and brutally murders him, crucifying him onto a ceiling. Jericho and Chicago see a name amongst many other things scratched into Aquinas\'s skin, and after some guesswork, begin searching for Christine York. Jericho and Chicago find the now-adult York  in her apartment and save her from the Vatican Knights who attempt to assassinate her. That evening, Chicago waits in a van while Jericho discusses the recent happenings with Christine. Satan arrives and blows up the van, killing Chicago. As Jericho and Christine try to flee, they are apprehended by Mabel who is possessed with preternatural strength despite her late middle age and lesser size. Jericho barely manages to subdue her. Satan then appears at the house and Jericho and Christine flee upstairs and escape through a window. Outside, Marge , Jericho\'s superior from his days in the police force and another police officer—both Satanists—confront him, demanding Christine. Jericho kills them both. A few moments later, Satan resurrects Marge for her usefulness as a NYPD detective to have the police search for Jericho and Christine, who have escaped to a nearby church, seeking answers from a priest, Father Kovak . Kovak soon realizes Christine and the banker\'s roles. He describes how at the end of every millennium, Satan will possess a man\'s body to consummate with the flesh of a preordained woman. If he succeeds in taking York, he will have free rein over the world. After hearing that the only way to defeat Satan is to "have faith", Jericho tries to persuade Christine to go into hiding with him, but she prefers to stay with Kovak after he says that Satan\'s greatest trick was to fool Mankind that he did not exist and she felt Kovak\'s explanation was true. Frustrated, Jericho returns to his apartment, where Satan meets with him and tries to tempt him with his lost family and his anger at God in order to make him reveal Christine\'s location. Jericho resists and manages to throw Satan out of his apartment window. Chicago soon shows up, alive and well. Despite Jericho\'s initial suspicion, they make a plan to retrieve Christine. At the church, where Kovak and his clergy informs the Pope of York\'s location, he orders them to hide and protect her at all costs. Unfortunately, the Vatican Knights arrive again, taking Kovak and his clergy into custody while they try to kill Christine again. Before they manage to do so, however, Jericho comes by and stops them, saving Christine and the clergy. Satan then appears, and Jericho runs away safely with Christine. The clergymen, in an act of bravery, confront Satan and try to send him back to Hell by using exorcism, but he resists them with impunity, killing the Vatican Knights, including the misguided cardinal. As Jericho and Christine arrive outside, Chicago then betrays the two; he leaves with Christine while Jericho is beaten by a mob of Satanists and left for dead. The next morning, Jericho is found and rescued by Kovak. Jericho immediately arms himself heavily to resume his search for Christine. He notices the resurrected Marge and follows her to Satan\'s hidden temple. There, he manages to rescue Christine and kill Marge for the second time. Chicago steps in to stop Jericho, revealing that Satan resurrected him in exchange for his help in capturing Christine. He manages to fight off Satan\'s influence after some persuasion by his friend; in retaliation, Satan burns him alive. Enraged, Jericho opens fire on Satan and escapes with Christine in the ensuing chaos. The two make their way through Satan\'s hideout and into a subway tunnel. They board a train and attempt to escape. Satan catches up with them and kills the motorman. In the ensuing fight, Jericho fires an M203 grenade launcher at Satan, wrecking the train and buying them enough time to escape. The banker\'s body is now irreparably damaged and so Satan leaves it to find a new host. Jericho and Christine escape to the streets and into another church where he prays to Jesus God the Son and God the Father. Satan smashes through the floor and confronts Jericho in his true form: a massive, winged, demonic creature. He enters Jericho\'s body and possesses him. Now controlled by Satan, Jericho attempts to rape Christine, but with the help of her begging words, he is able to fight Satan\'s control for a few seconds. Using what may be his only opportunity to redeem himself, Jericho impales himself on the sword protruding from a fallen statue of Saint Michael The Archangel, thus disabling his body for the few remaining seconds before midnight. At the stroke of midnight beginning the year 2000, the will of God frees Jericho\'s body from Satan\'s control and sends Satan back to the depths of Hell forever. After being granted a vision of his wife and daughter smiling and waiting for him on the "other side" , Jericho dies contented. Christine thanks the deceased man for saving her life as New York celebrates the start of the new 2000 millennium.'] ['The movie is set in Antarctica, where the U.S. military has a secret illegal mining operation.

Once there, she finds out Isaac was not killed by "He Who Walks Behind The Rows", but instead went into a coma. The hospital appears to be filled with strange patients. They talk of a prophecy involving Hannah and Isaac before the scene changes. After she leaves the hospital and begins back on road, she is nearly driven off the road by a mysterious truck. After swaying off onto a small dirt road and pulling into a strange motel, she finds a dead crow and a strange smiling child. At the motel, she meets a pair of romantically-involved teenagers, a girl and her boyfriend, Matt. They then check into the motel.

Meanwhile, the scene changes and it is revealed that Isaac has awakened from his long 19 year sleep  and that he has a son. Hannah returns to the hospital, where she begins having visions in the empty hallway, before Gabriel appears behind her. He shows her to the record room so she can look for her birth certificate. While they are in there in the dark, she is almost killed when Jake tries to split her head open with an axe. Gabriel leaves Hannah alone to take Jake back to his room. While left alone, Hannah finds a scythe pinning what she thinks is her birth certificate into the wall. In the middle of the night, a strange woman tries to touch Hannah while she is lying in bed, but leaves once she realizes Hannah is awake. Hannah recognizes her truck as the one that drove her off the road. She follows the truck till dawn into the middle of a field, but before she can follow the person, she runs into Jesse: another strange teenager carrying a large blade. He tells her the owner of the truck is Rachel Colby, the same name on the birth certificate. In her motel room, Hannah finds "GET OUT OR DIE!" written in what seems to be blood. Back at the church, Rachel confronts Isaac. It is revealed that Rachel is the wife of Amos  and she believes her daughter to be dead. When she leaves, Isaac tells how she will be punished for her betrayal. Rachel later talks with Dr. Michaels, who just wants to move on beyond the ideas of cults and sacrifices. He tells Rachel to do whatever she needs to do to try to stop Isaac. When Dr. Michaels comes back to the hospital, he finds Jake has clogged the sink and caused water to go all over the floor and is now muttering mindlessly on his knees. Isaac steps out of the shadows, displaying supernatural power. Michaels stands, unafraid of him, warning him to leave Hannah alone, exposing himself as the one who took Hannah away from the town. Isaac pulls a sparking electric cord from the wall and drops it on the wet floor, electrocuting Michaels. Later, Isaac approaches the son, who is revealed to be Matt. He is proud in the belief that his son will carry on his legacy. Matt, though, seems less than enthusiastic. While Gabriel talks with Isaac in the cornfield, Hannah is meanwhile driven off the road again, this time by a drunken Matt. After she yells at him, he hands her a shovel and tells her he is a descendant of Isaac and for her to trace her lineage. Hannah begins digging up the grave of Baby Colby, Rachel\'s apparently dead child. As she digs, the bloody dead body falls right above her head hanging from a tree; however, this turns out to be only an illusion. Rachel is in the graveyard with her and warns her that there\'s no going back if she continues. Hannah then says she\'ll only leave if Rachel tells her the truth. Rachel denies her this, calling it "repulsive". As Hannah prepares to open the casket, a desperate Rachel tells her the prophecy: "The firstborn daughter of the children will return on the eve of her nineteenth birthday to find out who she is and He-Who-Walks-Behind-The-Rows will awaken". Hannah opens the casket to see it is empty and Rachel knew Hannah was her child and wasn\'t dead. She tells a hurt Hannah that Isaac wants Hannah to make a new "pure" race.

They begin to perform a union ceremony between her and Matt, but Hannah escapes. They try to catch her, activating the irrigation system and driving motorcycles through the fields. Rachel appears before the cult members, claiming Isaac is a fraud. In the fields, Matt\'s girlfriend attempts to help Hannah escape, because she wants to be with Matt. They are soon cornered by the cult members, who capture them. It turns out that Gabriel was on the bike Hannah was put on and takes her out of the cornfields. Matt\'s girlfriend, though, isn\'t so lucky and Isaac orders Matt to kill her. Matt refuses, so Isaac, cursing his son, intends to kill her himself, splitting her in half with Jesse\'s blade. With that, Matt runs into the cornfield. Gabriel cares for Hannah in a barn, tending her wounds and helps her bathe and, in the barn, he kisses her. They begin to partake in sexual intercourse at the exact moment the clock strikes twelve. Matt then soon appears in the barn and Hannah asks about her mother and, after not receiving any answer, leaves to look for her.

In the hallway, she meets Jake, who warns her of "a false prophet, sheep’s clothing, raving wolves!" while Gabriel kills Jesse with some sort of supernatural power. Hannah now confronts Isaac, who now believes himself to be \'He-Who-Walks-Behind-The-Rows\' and has gone mad with power. Gabriel storms down the halls of the hospital and, when Cora tries to shoot him, with a flick of his wrist and the word \'bang\', has her kill herself. He then confronts Isaac and exposes that he was the firstborn child of the children and that Isaac denied him his birthright in favor of his own son. Gabriel tells Hannah to kill Isaac, but listening to her mother, Hannah does not. Gabriel goes on to explain how everything that has happened has gone according to his plan. He then levitates Isaac with his power and reveals himself to be \'He-Who-Walks-Behind-The-Rows". He restrains Isaac to the ground and stabs him with the broken end of a lead pipe. Rachel stabs Gabriel and together, they flee from the hospital. Gabriel, though, is healed almost instantly and begins to set off explosions, which kills Jake. Rachel and Hannah are then seen walking down the road, with Hannah now pregnant with the child of \'He-Who-Walks-Behind-The-Rows\'.'] ["{{plot}} The movie begins in the middle of an exorcism, while demon hunter Jake Greyman waits downstairs in case the exorcism does not end well as it inevitably ends with the possessed girl killing the priest.

Their partnership is awkward at first due to Sarah's drastic difference in beliefs about the human world. They soon discover, after Jake looks through the personal belongings of the last possessed girl, that she worked at a modeling agency. Upon arriving at the office of the modeling agency Jake and Sarah finds the owner hung and gutted, Sarah leaves unable to stand the sight  of the corpse. While Jake searches through the desk the succubus, who works for the demon that Jake is hunting, comes through the dead man to taunt Jake – telling him that he has a different purpose in life and that he should take his rightful place in the world. Jake ignores the succubus and returns to the Cardinal to inform him that the three previous girls were all prostitutes and that the now deceased owner of the agency was their pimp and that there was a fourth name on the list. However, though he did mention the succubus he did not reveal the truth as to what she said to him. Jake and Sarah track down the fourth name on the list, finding her to live in a very large house and that she married a wealthy man. Sarah believes the girl, Nancy, is safer because of this though Jake does not. The Demon has summoned Nancy and she leaves in a limo to the cemetery, where the Demon is hiding. Jake and Sarah, staked outside of Nancy's home, follow her there. At the cemetery Nancy leaves flowers at a grave and sees the demon. She informs her guards that the man is an old friend of her husband's and that they are to wait for her because she wants to speak to him in private and she then follows into the crypt where she saw the demon. Despite following Nancy to the cemetery Jake and Sarah are too late; they approach Nancy's guards just in time to find her stumbling back to the group of men in a daze and already showing signs of demonic possession. Jakes knows he must kill Nancy before she has a chance to give birth to the demon's offspring, just as he did with the previous girls. A fight ensues between Jake and Nancy's guards, Nancy flees and Jake yells to Sarah for her to follow. Jake finds Sarah on the ground, alone, and gets angry when he realizes that she can not kill the girl possessed because she sees the women as victims and believes they could have been saved. Jake tells Sarah to return to the convent and walks away, in which she replies that he is a soulless bastard. At this point the demon had witnessed Jake's fight with the guards and his disappointment in Sarah and he calls to Sarah to come to him and to seek comfort with him. Jake interrogates one of Nancy's guards and walks back to the car where Sarah is waiting. Sarah talks Jake into letting her stay with him by claiming while she can't kill the girls or him, if he turns and joins the demons  but that she is willing to die for her convictions and that when Jake goes against this demon she may be the only edge he has. Jake and Sarah follow a lead down to an abandoned hotel where Nancy may be hiding. The demon is seen snatching a prostitute in the alley of the hotel, he then watches Jake and Sarah enter the building and then lies beside the unconscious prostitute and begins licking her. Inside the hotel Jake and Sarah come across a naked and dying man, he speaks of Nancy who is responsible for his condition and falls back into unconsciousness as Jake and Sarah continue deeper into the hotel now knowing that they are on the right trail. The next scene brings you to a hotel room where the demon and his succubus are talking about the half breed  and Sarah. The succubus points out that the demon has become infatuated with Sarah because of her innocence. The succubus wishes to have Jake, she believes he'd be a powerful ally. The demon tells her he is too dangerous and that he is to be destroyed, however the succubus eventually persuades the demon to allow her to have him to enslave his soul and control him. As Jake and Sarah walk the halls of the hotel they come across rooms with various couples having sex, Jake determines the demon they are looking for is Asmodeus, the demon of lust, his power is what draws the prostitutes to the hotel and so he must be somewhere in the hotel. Jake and Sarah come across Nancy, after a brief scuffle Nancy runs off. Jake tells Sarah to wait in the hallway and he goes after Nancy. While searching one of the rooms Jake is confronted by the succubus who attempts to seduce him while Asmodeus shows up in the hallway where Sarah is waiting. Asmodeus once again calls for Sarah to follow him, she does but with her weapons ready for use against him. Sarah is assaulted in the hallway by Nancy, Sarah uses her cross to burn Nancy and she then flees with Sarah chasing after her. Jake is seen rolling on the floor and kissing the succubus, which brings him closer to his cross and distracts the succubus enough for him to grab the weapon and kill her. Nancy is found by Sarah and after Nancy attempts to pounce Sarah shoots her with a gun in an attempt to slow her down to kill her but Asmodeus appears to Sarah following the shots which were also heard by Jake. Sarah shoots at Asmodeus but the bullets do nothing to him and the gun runs out of bullets. Asmodeus knocks Sarah out just before Jake shows up. Jake and Asmodeus fight, Jakes loses but Asmodeus does not kill him – claiming it doesn't matter to him whether Jakes lives or dies because in the end his soul will belong to him. Jake awakes in the morning to find Sarah gone. He steals a motorcycle after breaking the arm of the biker. He rides to cemetery where Asmodeus seduces his other victims, and where he has brought Sarah. While Asmodeus begins to have sex with Sarah she transforms into demon and kills him. Jake hears the growls of a demon and rushes into the crypt to see Sarah, as a demon, devouring the heart of Asmodeus. Sarah explains to Jake that he is not the only half breed to have been born and to have his dark side restricted by the church. Jake and Sarah fight after she refuses to play for the side of God any longer and is unable to convince Jake to do the same. Jake strangles Sarah and then walks out of the crypt seeming to be genuinely distraught over having to kill her. Jake goes to the church and confronts the Cardinal, angry and demanding why he wasn't told that Sarah was a half breed. He tells Jake that it was best if no one knew and that Sarah didn't know herself and while they had hoped Jake would kill the demon before he could get to Sarah, which they knew would bring out the demon in her, it wasn't a terrible loss that she is now dead. The movie ends with seeing the prostitute Asmodeus had snatched in the alley of the hotel now possessed with his offspring and then the camera pans up to see Jake dropping down from a fire escape to kill the prostitute."] ['Claire McKay —having suffered the death of her boyfriend—is brought by her mother to Ironbound Island in the hopes that time away from the city will allow her to recover emotionally.

Since the age of 11 she has been a troubled person, with episodes of self-mutilation and menacing visions. Normally she avoids returning to her native Texas, but agrees to a trip there to secure an important client. During the trip her visions, which take the form of memories of events not from her life, increase in intensity. She sees a strange face staring back at her in the mirror. Her truck radio plays Patsy Cline\'s "Sweet Dreams" no matter what station she selects. She stops at the scene of an accident that, on the following day, seems not to have happened. Joanna cuts herself in a bar restroom and is narrowly rescued by a friend. She visits her father, who observes that from age 11 she was "a different girl". The visions continue, becoming both more specific and more threatening, centering upon a menacing man she does not recognize and a bar she has never seen, but a picture of which is in one of her catalogs. Drawn by the image to the Texas town where the bar is located, a place she has not been since childhood, Joanna meets a man named Terry Stahl, whose wife, Annie, was stalked, brutally assaulted, and left to die fifteen years before, a crime of which Terry was suspected but not convicted. Joanna continues to have visions of this crime and the events that led up to it, and to discover other links between Annie\'s life and hers. She meets the real killer and is led by what she has seen in her visions to recover the knife he used from its hiding place. She is then stalked, herself. She finds herself drawn into a repetition of the crime, but this time she stabs her assailant with the recovered knife, using the original weapon to avenge the original crime. The story ends with the revelation that Annie, clinging to life as Terry drove her to the hospital after the original assault, died when his car crashed into one driven by Joanna\'s father, in which the eleven-year-old Joanna was a passenger. After momentary unconsciousness, the young Joanna seems to have survived the crash. A silent Joanna is seen reflecting on who she is and what has happened to her. She seems to reach an inner resolution of these questions. An alternative ending included on the DVD release more straightforwardly supports the interpretation that Annie\'s soul has been placed in Joanna\'s body.'] ['"The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar" Jessica Valdemar, an attractive middle-aged woman, rides in a taxi to the downtown Pittsburgh office of Steven Pike, her elderly husband’s lawyer with some paperwork for Mr. Pike approval. Pike sees that Jessica’s the 63-year-old husband named Ernest Valdemar, who is dying from an unnamed terminal illness, is liquidating a number of his assets for cash and suspects Jessica of having undue influence on him. Jessica denies the allegations that she’s any negative influence over her husband, while Pike makes a phone call to the house to talk with Ernest Valdemar, who speaks over the phone in a weak but coherent voice explaining about his decision to let Jessica take control of his money and assets from his personal signature on the written documents that she has. Pike reluctantly agrees to let Jessica have access to the money, but warns her that if anything were to happen to Mr. Valdemar within the next three weeks before the transfer of his estate over to Jessica is finalized, she will be investigated by the authorities. Jessica returns home to Ernest Valdemar’s large suburban mansion where she meets with Dr. Robert Hoffman where its revealed that he and Jessica have been conspiring to cheat the terminally ill Mr. Valdemar out of his estate by hypnotizing him and having him do what they wish from his deathbed. Jessica doesn’t like the procedure, but Robert wants it done because he used to have a romance with Jessica and wants to run off with her after they acquire his $3 million assets. The next day, Jessica goes to a bank where she withdraws $300,000 and stores it in a safe. Robert sees this. But then, Mr. Valdemar goes into cardiac arrest and dies while under another hypnosis spell. Not wanting to reveal his death just yet, Robert and Jessica carry his body to the basement where they hide it in a freezer. But during the night, Jessica becomes frightened when she hears moaning coming from the basement, but when she tries to wake up Robert, he has put himself under a hypnotic-induced slumber to help him sleep. The next morning, Jessica and Robert wake up and also hear the same noises coming from the basement. Upon checking the body, they hear Ernest Valdemar’s voice coming from the still body claiming that his soul is alive and trapped in a dark void between the living and the dead while under hypnosis. Valdemar tells them that he sees "others" in the dark void looking at him. While Jessica goes out to make sense of this situation, she returns to find Robert talking to Mr. Valdemar’s undead corpse who tells him that the "others" are vengeful spirits trapped in a realm and want to use him to enter our world. Valdemar tells Robert to wake him up and free him from his hypnotic state. In a panic, Jessica shoots Valdemar’s corpse and wants to bury the body and skip town with the money they have. While Robert heads outside to dig a hole to bury the body, Jessica goes back into the cellar only to find Valdemar’s body rising up out of the freezer and walking towards her saying that he is under control of "the others" to use him. Jessica shoots him, but he keeps on coming. Robert enters the house when he hears the gunshots and sees Jessica and Valdemar struggling on the balcony where the undead walking cadaver shoots Jessica in the head and she falls off the balcony, dead. Robert finally tells Valdemar that he’s going to wake him and free him from his hypnosis. But after doing so by counting to five, Valdemar tells Robert that it\'s too late to wake him for without his body as a conduit, the Others cannot return to their realm. "They\'re with you now!" exclaims Valdemar, who finally falls dead. Robert then steals all the cash that Jessica had stored in the safe and flees the house. Robert goes back to his apartment in downtown Pittsburgh, where he puts himself under a hypnotic sleep. But then, the ghostly "Others" enter his apartment and kill him by shoving the hypnotic digital counter into his chest.

Several days later, the police led by Detective Grogan arrive at Robert’s apartment to answer complaints about a "strange smell" and constant moaning coming from the apartment. Grogan finds the apartment ransacked and the stolen cash scattered everywhere. But just then, the horribly decomposed body of Robert, under the control of the Others, appears and attacks Grogan, telling him that there is nobody to wake him up. "The Black Cat" Rod Usher makes his entrance in a building decorated with the abject remains of dismantled corpses. A naked woman lies bound to a table, sliced in two by a huge pendulum-like blade. Rod is a professional crime scene photographer for as he puts it: "still life’s my art," a talent which ensures that he is frequently called upon the local authorities -led by Detective LeGrand- to document the horrors of the baroque crime scenes which are apparently commonplace in Pittsburgh where Rod lives. After arriving home at a semi-fancy row house, Rod works in his darkroom in the basement developing the photos when his work is interrupted by the appearance of a mysterious black cat, which has apparently been adopted by his live-in girlfriend Annabel. Rod and Annabel’s relationship is uncomfortably distant. Annabel is delicate, sensitive, and somewhat ethereal, while Rod is a rough, burly, brutish man who seem more at home with the gritty hyper-reality of crime scenes that he is with Annabel’s talk of witches and superstition. Annabel, in contrast to Rod, is a professional violinist who gives private lessons to local high school students who show up at the house after their school classes, and she even takes some of them on excursions to local opera houses to watch the arts of life. Over the next several days, a strong antipathy grows between Rod and the mysterious cat, a situation worsened by Annabel’s excessive protection of it. Driven to distraction by the cat’s apparent hatred of him, Rod eventually strangles it during a photo shoot he has set up with the cat being the center of attention. Rod then uses the photos of him strangling the cat to post on the cover of his newest photography book, titled Metropolitan Horrors, a lurid collection of his most revolting pictures. As Annabel begins to guess the truth about what has happened to her pet, the couple embarks on a series of violent arguments, one of which ends with Rod falling into an alcohol-induced sleep where he has a nightmare about participating in a Medieval Pagan festival where he is executed for the murder of the cat. One day, when Annabel finally spots his book in a shop window, with the strangled body of her much-loved cat on the front cover, she immediately goes home and makes plans to leave Rod, who at that very moment is in a local bar drinking heavily. Rod becomes unnerved when the barmaid Eleanora gives him a stray black cat, which is identical to Annabel’s own cat. Rod notices that the inky feline has an identical white marking on its chest . Rod brings the cat home and sets about to kill the feline once and for all. But Annabel intervenes and comes to the cat\'s rescue, causing a confrontation which ends in her gruesome and gory death when Rod hacks her to death with a meat cleaver. After shaking off his suspicious next door neighbor and landlord, Mr. Pym, who arrives after hearing the argument, Rod assures him that nothing is wrong. Confident that he can escape detection, Rod conceals the body behind a wall in the house and invents a story to explain Annabel’s disappearance to her music students, Betty and Christian, when they show up the next day for their violin lessons. But after a confrontation with Christian, who expresses doubt and suspicion to Rod about his story of Annabel leaving him, he confides in Mr. and Mrs. Pym about his suspicions that Rod might have killed Annabel. When Annabel’s friend in New York keeps phoning the house to ask of her whereabouts, Rod becomes increasingly trapped by his own increasing elaborate web of lies. The situation is exacerbated by yet another appearance of the black cat. But this time, Rod ensures its death by slicing it in two with a saw, and disposes of it in a garbage dump. The next day, Detective LeGrand arrives with his partner to question Rod about Annabel’s whereabouts. Despite their stern questioning, Rod is not fazed by their questions. After looking around the house, the detectives leave, but immediately come back when an eerie, distorted mewing sound is heard echoing though one of the walls. Rod is handcuffed and the fake wall of that he put up is torn down and his crime scene is finally revealed. It reveals that the ever troublesome feline had given birth in Annabel’s tomb and its offspring are now feasting on the remains of their mistress. Not to be outdone, Rod grabs the pickaxe from LeGrand\'s partner and in seconds kills both policemen. But handcuffed and in a panic, Rod tries to make his escape when his neighbors show up after nearing the commotion, pounding on the front door. Rod attempts to flee from his house by climbing out a second floor window by using a rope to tie around a tree in his backyard. But his plan fails when he gets tangled in the rope and slips, the rope tightening around his neck and killing him. The black cat makes a final appearance and stares at the fate Rod had coming for him.'] ['Many years before the events in The Exorcist, the young Father Lankester Merrin  travels to East Africa.

Winter kills and resurrects Amy, resulting in her experiencing an extended waking dream during which she relives sexual abuse from her childhood. Coming back to reality in the Deaders\' compound, Amy successfully opens the box and summons the Cenobites. Their leader, Pinhead, expresses disdain for Winter and his family and denies that any mortal could ever control the Cenobites.

He is named Deputy Ambassador to the Court of St. James , and after the ambassador dies in a bizarre accident, becomes Ambassador and settles in to a large estate just outside London. However, disturbing events start to revolve around Damien , the most prominent being his nanny hanging herself at his birthday party, driven to do so by a large black belgian sheepdog. Soon afterward, Robert is approached by Father Brennan , who delivers an eerie warning and seems to know the truth about Damien\'s birth, at which point Robert has him escorted out. Meanwhile, photographer Keith Jennings  finds that several of his photographs contain mysterious signs, later revealed to foreshadow a series of shocking deaths. A new nanny, Mrs. Baylock , is hired and tells Damien that she has been sent to protect him. Tension between Mrs. Baylock and the Thorns rises when the nanny starts to make decisions against their wishes, including bringing a large watchdog  to the home without their consent. On the way to the previous nanny\'s funeral, Damien becomes terrified as they approach the church, attacking Katherine. That night Katherine experiences a first premonition/nightmare dream about Damien. The following day a field trip to the city zoo ends with various species of primates going berserk at the sight of Damien. Katherine suspects that there is something not right about her son, but Robert brushes off her concerns. Robert is again confronted by Father Brennan, who tells him that Damien must die and a man called Bugenhagen, located in Megiddo, can show him how. Enraged, Robert sends him away again. Caught in a torrential storm, Brennan attempts to seek shelter in a church, but the door is mysteriously bolted. A lightning bolt strikes the church steeple, causing him to be impaled by a large steel rod which falls from the roof.

While watering plants on an upper floor, Katherine is knocked off a chair by Damien riding his scooter, and tumbles over the railing.

They find the grave of Maria Avedici Santoya, Damien\'s real mother, in the old cemetery of Cerveteri, and discover that it contains the skeleton of a jackal, implying that Damien cannot be human. In the neighboring tomb, Robert discovers the corpse of a human infant with a cracked skull, revealing that his biological son was murdered at birth. He and Jennings are suddenly attacked by a pack of rottweilers, and barely escape. Meanwhile, Mrs. Baylock visits Katherine in the hospital under the pretense of delivering flowers and then induces an air embolism by introducing air from an empty syringe into her IV, killing her. After learning of Katherine\'s death, Robert decides to follow Brennan\'s advice and kill Damien. He goes to Megiddo and meets Bugenhagen , who tells them that Damien is the long-prophesied Antichrist, and the only way to destroy him is to take him to holy ground and kill him with the seven sacrificial daggers of Megiddo. To prove his claims, Bugenhagen tells Robert to examine Damien for the 666 birthmark. Robert at first expresses disbelief, refuses to kill his son and leaves. However, Jennings is determined to go through with the plan, and picks up the daggers. After a brief exchange of words with Robert, he is suddenly decapitated by a falling sign. This pushes Robert to change his mind. Robert arrives home during a torrential storm. The dog attacks but Robert manages to trap it.

After the service is over, the Secret Service informs the President that his car is waiting. The President is seen to be holding the hand of Damien, whom he has presumably adopted. The last shot shows Damien slowly turning to give the camera a diabolical smile.'] ['As usual, Ju-on: The Grudge is divided into six short vignettes which seems to be interconnected with each other. The chronological order of the film would be the Tokunaga family , followed by Rika, Toyama, Kayako, and lastly Izumi.  Rika is a volunteer social worker charged with caring for Tokunaga Sachie, a catatonic elderly lady. She discovers the quiet suburban home in a state of disarray and her ward malnourished and soiled, with no one else home. While vacuuming she finds a family picture with the wife\'s face cut out. Upstairs she hears shuffling noises coming from the bedroom closet, which has been taped shut. Rika removes the tape and opens the door when she hears meowing sounds. Inside the closet she discovers a black cat and a young boy whom she recognizes from the photo. She calls the welfare center to report the incident. She hangs up and is startled to see the boy staring down at her from the upstairs balcony. She asks for his name. "Toshio" is his reply. Murmuring from Sachie\'s room draws Rika\'s attention. Rika attempts to calm Sachie and helps her lie down. Sachie\'s eyes suddenly widen with fear as she sees something on the ceiling. A dark figure making a death rattle slowly descends upon Sachie and frightens Rika. A pair of eyes appear within the figure, which open and stare directly at Rika, who then faints. Toshio is last seen standing next to her.  Kazumi, Katsuya\'s wife and Sachie\'s daughter-in-law, cannot sleep at night because of what she presumes to be her mother-in-law\'s restless stirring. Kazumi reminds her husband as he leaves for work that his sister, Hitomi, is expected for dinner. She falls asleep on the couch and is startled awake. At first she assumes that it was Sachie, but soon sees a pair of fresh handprints on the door. She discovers a black cat on the stairs. When she approaches, a pair of small pale arms reach out and take the cat, which scares Kazumi. She enters the bedroom upstairs. Kazumi\'s screams and the cat\'s mewing are heard before the screen goes black. Katsuya comes home to find the house untidy and his wife lying on bed unable to move or speak, her eyes wide open with shock. As he prepares to call for an ambulance, he senses another presence in the room and soon encounters the ghostly boy, Toshio. Katsuya asks who he is but gets no reply as the closet doors shake. Kazumi\'s eyes widen, her mouth opens, and she rises before falling back and becoming still. Katsuya huddles into a corner with fear and his facial expression suddenly turns evil. The shadow of something descending from the ceiling is cast on him. Hitomi arrives for dinner and calls for Katsuya and Kazumi but receives no response. Upstairs, Katsuya carries Kazumi\'s limp body into another room. Hitomi hears the door closing and walks to the stairs and sees her brother sitting there. Katsuya is behaving strangely and keeps muttering something about his wife cheating on him and a child that isn\'t his. She asks where is Kazumi but Katsuya ignores her and pushes her out of the house. Back indoors, Katsuya walks up the stairs towards the room where his wife\'s body is, with an evil expression on his face. A silhouette of a woman\'s face is seen on the window of the room.  Hitomi is one of the last people to leave the office building. She unsuccessfully attempts to call her brother on her way out. On her way out, she hears strange shuffling sounds in the corridor, which seem to be coming from behind her. Slightly unnerved, Hitomi stops in the washroom, where her phone rings and identifies the caller as her brother. When she answers, a death rattle is heard coming from the mobile phone. In the cubicle next to her a provoking banging begins, Hitomi apologizes and hangs up the phone. A small teddy bear ornament falls from her handbag as she begins to leave the bathroom. As Hitomi reaches for it the cubicle door opens and an ethereal curtain of black hair moves ominously toward her, emitting the same death rattle she heard on the phone. Hitomi runs to the security office and asks the guard to investigate. She observes him via a surveillance camera in the office and sees him checking the corridor until he stops outside the washroom. The footage slightly distorts and a shadow from inside the washroom is cast on the guard. Hitomi screams and dashes out. The surveillance camera now shows no one in the corridor. Hitomi hastily retreats to her apartment and enters the elevator. As the elevator ascends, the ghost boy Toshio\'s face is seen through the elevator window on every floor until Hitomi reaches her destination. At home, Hitomi receives a call from Katsuya, who says he is coming and asks her for her apartment number. Before she can hang up, her doorbell rings and she sees her brother outside through the peephole. She opens the door eagerly but finds the hallway empty. She hears the death rattle from the phone still in her hand and quickly throws it in the hallway and slams the door shut. She goes to bed and covers herself with the blanket. She switches on the television and sees the news. The screen and audio suddenly become distorted and the reporter\'s face twists into a Ghostface-like image and the death rattle is heard again before the television shuts down by itself. Petrified, she continues to hide in bed until she feels something and pulls it out. It\'s the teddy bear ornament she lost in the washroom. She throws it to the ground in fear. A human-shaped lump manifests from beneath the blanket at the far end of the bed. Hitomi lifts the blanket and sees a woman, who quickly pulls Hitomi towards her. A full shot of the room is seen and no one is on the bed.  When Rika does not return to the care center, her boss Hirohashi goes to the house to check on her. He finds Sachie dead and Rika in a state of shock. While investigating the house, detectives call Katsuya\'s cell phone and hear ringing coming from upstairs. They eventually track the sound to the attic, where they find the dead bodies of Katsuya and Kazumi. Further investigations revealed that people who had lived in that house either died mysteriously or disappeared. Rika claims she saw Toshio in the house but the boy cannot be found. Hitomi is missing and witnesses claim that they last saw her entering her apartment. Hirohashi is later found dead under the sink in a washroom. The investigators turn to a retired detective Toyama for answers. Toyama previously took on a case on a man called Saeki Takeo, who murdered his wife Kayako and son Toshio in that house five years ago. While viewing the security video tape from Hitomi\'s office building, Toyama sees the guard being taken into the washroom by a shadow. As he continues watching, he sees the dark figure of a woman emerging from the washroom and walking down the corridor, until a face suddenly rises directly in front of the camera and stares into it. At home, Rika is lying on bed when she suddenly sees Toshio beside her, and hears the death rattle sound coming from above her. The ghost Kayako is behind her, bending over and staring at her. Convinced that the house is the source of all the mysterious incidents, Toyama goes there with gasoline, intent on burning it to the ground. While inside, he experiences a vision of his 12 year old daughter Izumi in the future as a teenager. She is leaving the house when she stops for a while upon seeing her father. Toyama goes upstairs and sees Izumi\'s friends before they are attacked by an unseen force. The atmosphere changes back from bright to dark, and Toyama sees the ghost Kayako crawling towards him. In fear, he half-staggers and half-falls back down the stairs. Just then, the two investigators who came with him appear and ask him what happened. Too frightened to speak, Toyama manages to get up and scrambles out of the house as Kayako slowly creeps down the stairs towards the two petrified investigators.  Several years later Izumi is a teenager and her father, Toyama, long since dead – another Ju-on casualty. As Izumi and two friends walk to school, she notices a missing persons poster featuring three of her friends. She was with them the day they disappeared from a house rumored to be haunted. Izumi feels guilty because she ran away from the house in fear, leaving her three friends to their fates. At school the girls notice that there are no photos of Izumi from a recent event and complain to their teacher about it. Izumi\'s state of mind has been deteriorating since the day they went to that house. She keeps the curtains closed, covers her head with a hood, and clutches a pillow. Her friends visit and are disturbed by Izumi\'s condition and her mother\'s strange behavior. One of them draws the curtain and sees that the windows are covered with newspaper. Izumi shrieks. After she has calmed down, she relates to them about her trip to the haunted house and her feelings of guilt. As the girls leave, Izumi\'s mother tells them that her husband also exhibited the same behavior before his death. The girls remember the photos they brought to show Izumi and understand why the teacher did not post any pictures of Izumi after looking at them. In every photo, Izumi\'s eyes are eerily blackened out, as were the eyes of her three missing friends. Back in her bedroom, Izumi is having a vision of her dead father when she realizes that there are newspaper scraps on her bed and moves quickly to stick them back on the window. When she pulls back the curtain, she sees her three missing friends, faces pale and grey, staring at her through gaps in the newspaper. She flees in terror, with the three ghosts in hot pursuit, and ends up in the room her father was in in her earlier vision. She uses various items to block the door but that does not deter the ghosts. Izumi panics and huddles back right towards the Shinto altar in her house. Suddenly, ghostly hands, belonging to Kayako, emerge from behind and drag the kicking and screaming Izumi into the altar as the three ghosts continue to approach. The faces of Izumi and her father are seen at the altar before they materialize into the darkness. In the bonus material of the DVD, film director Takashi Shimizu explained that he intended to include a similar effect of the three friends\' faces materializing into the shelves in the room, but he dropped the idea because he thought it would either be ridiculed or take away the focus of Izumi\'s death and place it on the entire group instead. Before Izumi\'s death it is apparent that this scene takes place after the events in the earlier parts, because at one point her mother is watching a news report on the discovery of Rika\'s dead body. It is also theorized that Izumi is an unmentioned character in the last segment of Ju-on 2 , because the vignette is titled "Saori", the name of one of her friends who disappeared in the haunted house. Saori was the "ringleader" of the group.  Rika has more or less recovered from the trauma of her experience in the house. She arranges to meet an old friend Mariko for lunch. An old man plays peek-a-boo with an unseen person just outside the care center where she still works. Another worker, assuming that the man is feeble-minded, tries to join in the game and is rebuffed. The old man resumes his game with his unseen playmate, a sight which makes Rika uneasy. Toshio\'s reflection is visible in the glass, revealing the identity of the unseen playmate. While having lunch with Mariko, Rika feels something under the table and sees Toshio when she looks. She screams in terror. At home, Rika has weird experiences - while in the shower, she felt a hand on her head but there is no one inside but her; and she dreamed about several black cats in her bedroom. Rika later receives a call from Mariko, who tells her she is visiting a student who hasn\'t been to school for a long time. Rika suddenly hears a cat\'s mewing on the phone and the line goes dead. Rika comes to horrifying realization that Mariko is in the cursed house. She hurries there but is too late to help as she sees Mariko\'s body being dragged up into the attic. She follows Mariko\'s path and peers into the attic through an opening at the top of the closet, and sees Kayako crawling towards her. Rika panics and dashes down the stairs to the door. On the way she runs past a mirror and caught a brief glimpse of an unfamiliar reflection where her own should be. She stares at her own reflection and covers her face in the same manner as the old man playing peek-a-boo. Doing so reveals Kayako in the mirror, staring back at her through her fingers. After a frightening vision of Kayako emerging from her chest, Rika hears thumping noises overhead, and realizes that something is moving down the stairs. The ghost of Kayako, inside a blood-soaked plastic bag, is slowly creeping towards her. She seems to be reaching out for help. Rika covers her face with her hands again and to her horror, she sees herself as Kayako again. She comes to the terrible realization that she is destined to play out the curse. Kayako disappears after this revelation, and Rika hears footsteps coming from the stairs. She looks up and sees Kayako\'s husband Takeo, as a yurei, the source of the Ju-on, striding towards her. Looking upstairs, she can see Toshio peering at her through the banisters in the same fashion he watched his father kill his mother. As Rika remains rooted to the spot in fear, Takeo reaches for her, his hand covered with blood, and the screen goes black. Rika\'s death is portrayed more graphically in a deleted scene. The scene then turns to the streets - abandoned and littered with \'missing\' posters. Rika\'s body is seen wrapped in a plastic bag inside the attic. She now has long hair just like Kayako. As the camera zooms in on her face, her eyes open and she makes the same death rattle as Kayako. This scene is presumably set years later, perhaps in the same timeline as the "Izumi" chapter, as evidenced by the news report in that part.'] ['The American oil company KIK Corporation is building an ice road to explore the remote northern Arctic National Wildlife Refuge seeking energy independence. Independent environmentalists work together in a drilling base headed by the tough Ed Pollack in a sort of agreement with the government, approving procedures and sending reports of the operation. When one team member is found dead and naked on the snow, the environmentalist James Hoffman suspects that sour gas  may have been leaked out as a result of runaway climate change . The sour gas might then be provoking hallucinations and insanity in the group. After a second fatal incident, he convinces Ed to travel with the team to a hospital for examination. However, weird events end up trapping the group at the base. One of the characters presently opines that Nature itself has turned against mankind. Documentation and research found in an abandoned shack in the middle of the Arctic by another team member suggest that the Earth is releasing \'The Last Winter\'. This implies that the rapacious, virus-like behavior of oil-seeking humans has resurrected the \'ghosts\' of the fossil-fuels being siphoned out of the ground. The chief catalyst here is allegedly the Spirit of the Wendigo. These ghosts and other bizarre occurrences kill off most of the remaining characters. In the penultimate scene, Hoffman must decide whether to fire a flare gun at a ghost stalking Pollack, or up into the air to summon help from a nearby town, opting for the latter. This action causes the apparition to focus on Hoffman instead of Pollack, and it grabs him and carries him off. The scene then segues into a montage of past life images which interrupt themselves long enough to reveal Pollack being attacked and presumably killed by a trio of spectral creatures. The ending scene is that of the only surviving researcher, a woman, waking up alone in a deserted hospital with no recollection of arriving there. A news anchorman is broadcasting over a television in the waiting room about natural disasters occurring nation-wide. She discovers a male employee who has committed suicide by hanging himself in one of the rooms. She proceeds outside, and the camera\'s perspective switches to a claustrophobic overhead shot that gives away very little of what she is witnessing. There are pools of water on the ground nearby. In the background she hears car alarms and the sound of the wind, as well as a fluttering noise similar to that made by the murderous "ghost" creatures further north in the Alaskan snow fields.'] ["Art of the Devil tells the story of Boom , a young Thai girl who meets a married man named Prathan  at a country club. The two soon begin an affair, and Boom finds herself pregnant. When she breaks the news to Prathan, he appears to settle for giving her a sum of money in exchange for her silence, reassuring her that he won't leave her. However, he then wakes her up in the middle of the night, informing her that for that large an amount of money, he had the right to share her. While Prathan wields a video camera, his friends chase a terrified and screaming Boom out of the room and onto the beach, where they apparently gang-rape her. After getting an ultrasound at the hospital, Boom shows up at the restaurant where Prathan's daughter is celebrating her birthday and informs him that the sum of money he'd given her was not enough.

He loves ice hockey but lives for his girlfriend, Jenny Walker. Late one night while driving home from a painful loss on the ice, Ian comes across a bewildering discovery; what looks like a dead body near the railroad tracks. Investigating the grisly discovery, Ian is attacked by the "corpse", forced onto the tracks and subsequently barreled over by an oncoming train. He wakes up in an office cubicle. He\'s still alive, but older and shacked up with a beautiful, but eerily mysterious woman by the name of Medea. Jenny is still there, but she\'s not his girlfriend, just a co-worker and one of a number of apparently familiar faces. Ian meets a strange old man who implies he is in danger. From this old man he learns that he is being hunted by the Harvesters; a group of mind-controlling vampire-like characters who cannot be killed and feed off human fear. He explains that everyday, at different times and different places, the clocks stop and they come after him to kill him. The only problem is that Ian won\'t stay dead. He wakes in a new life, a new place, only for the cycle to repeat itself. Suddenly one of the Harvesters attacks the old man and Ian runs. They chase Ian mercilessly, all the way back to his apartment where Medea, who is clearly one of them, is waiting. Once again, Ian is killed. He wakes to find he\'s a junkie in a rundown apartment, with Jenny living a few doors down. He implores her to remember him, desperately reaching out and searching for someone to help him make sense of what\'s going on. When the Harvesters come again Jenny and Ian have no choice but to run. As they seek refuge on a subway train heading out-of-town, Jenny confesses to her memories of Ian\'s former lives. Later on, the old man meets Ian in the train again while Jenny sleeps. It is then that the old man reveals that he is one of the Harvesters, and hints at Ian\'s involvement with them. When they disembark they are again confronted by a group of Harvesters, a seething mass of pulsating veins, pitch-black muscles and midnight flesh. We recognize some of the barely human faces from Ian\'s previous lives including Medea who reveals a shocking truth: That Ian was one of these monsters until he rebelled against the colony and managed to kill one other Harvester, and Medea used to be his "mate". Medea tries to force Ian to feed again with fear and pain and return back to the "fold", but Ian decides against this. Medea and the Harvesters attack once more, and she explains that his rebellion came after his first encounter with Jenny. So moved was he by the girl, that he wished to live a mortal life with her. Before Medea can harm Jenny, however, a final change comes over Ian with the help of Gray, the Harvester who had helped him before. Apparently Ian found a sustenance that was far superior to fear or pain, and so did the old man: Love. Making this connection to a human being changes the specific nature of a Harvester, which allowed the old man  to kill the members of their kind. Gray had beseeched Ian to protect Jenny out of experience; having lost his love to the Harvesters, he could only feed on fear once again and spent what remained of his life slowly starving himself while trying to find love another time. Imploring Ian to feed off him and tap into those emotions of affection and kinship, Gray passes while restoring Ian. In doing so, Ian regains his true power: His Harvester-self is finally born out of his human flesh, uniquely exuding goodness rather than malevolence. He now has the capacity to turn the tables on these creatures and to feed on their fear and to give life. He then goes after Jenny, who is being actively stalked by his former clan. After saving Jenny, Ian creates a new life for them, with Ian as a successful professional hockey player with Jenny at his side. While Jenny has no recollection of their harrowing adventure, Ian, having realized his abilities, will begin to take the fight to the Harvesters.'] ['Taking place almost a year after The Dream Master, Alice and Dan have now started dating and there is no sign of Freddy Krueger.

The caller soon identifies himself as Frank, her ex-pimp who has recently escaped from prison. Rosy is terrified, for it was her testimony that landed the man in jail. Looking for solace, Rosy phones her lesbian lover, Mary . The two women have been estranged for some time, but Rosy is certain that she is the only one who can help her. Mary agrees to come over that night. Seconds later, Frank calls again, promising that no matter whom she calls for protection, he will have his revenge. Unknown to Rosy, Mary is the caller impersonating Frank. Mary arrives at Rosy\'s apartment soon after and does her best to calm Rosy\'s nerves. She gives the panic-stricken woman a tranquilizer and puts her to bed. Later that night, as Rosy sleeps, Mary gets up out of bed and pens a note of confession: she was the one making the strange phone calls when she learned of Frank\'s escape from prison. Knowing that Rosy would call on her for help, she explains that she felt it was her way of coming back into her life after their breakup. While she is busy writing, she fails to notice an intruder in the apartment. This time it is the real Frank. He creeps up behind Mary and strangles her to death with one of Rosy\'s nylon stockings. The sound of the struggle awakens Rosy and she gasps in fright. The murderous pimp realizes that he just killed the wrong woman, and slowly makes his way to Rosy\'s bed. However, earlier that night, Rosy had placed a butcher knife under her pillow at Mary\'s suggestion. Rosy seizes the knife and stabs Frank with it as he\'s beginning to strangle her. Rosy drops the knife and breaks down in hysteria, surrounded by the two corpses of her former lovers.  In 19th Century Russia, Vladimir Durfe  is a young nobleman on a long trip. During the course of his journey, he finds a beheaded corpse with a knife plunged into its heart. He withdraws the blade and takes it as a souvenir. Later that night, Vladimir stops at a small rural cottage to ask for shelter. He notices several daggers hanging up on one of the walls, and a vacant space that happens to fit the one he has discovered. Vladimir is surprised by the entrance of Giorgio , who explains that the knife belongs to his father, who has not been seen for five days. Giorgio offers a room to the young count, and subsequently introduces him to the rest of the family: his wife , their young son Ivan, Giorgio\'s younger brother Pietro , and sister Sdenka . It subsequently transpires that they are eagerly anticipating the arrival of their father, Gorcha, as well as the reason for his absence: he went to do battle with the outlaw and dreaded wurdalak Ali Beg. Vladimir is confused by the term, and Sdenka explains that a wurdalak is a walking cadaver who feeds on the blood of the living, preferably close friends and family members. Giorgio and Pietro are certain that the corpse Vladimir had discovered is that of Ali Beg, but also realize that there is a strong possibility that their father has been infected by the blood curse too. They warn the count to leave, but he decides to stay and await the old man\'s return. At the stroke of midnight, Gorcha  returns to the cottage. His sour demeanor and unkempt appearance bode the worse, and the two brothers are torn; they realize that it is their duty to kill Gorcha before he feeds on the family, but their love for him makes it difficult to reach a decision. Later that night, both Ivan and Pietro are attacked by Gorcha who drains them of blood and flees the cottage. Giorgio stakes and beheads Pietro to prevent him from reviving as a wurdalak, but he is prevented from doing so to Ivan when his wife threatens to commit suicide. Reluctantly, he agrees to bury the child without taking the necessary precautions. That same night, the child rises from his grave and begs to be invited into the cottage. The mother runs to her son\'s aid, stabbing Giorgio when he attempts to stop her, only to be greeted at the front door by Gorcha. The old man bites and infects his daughter-in-law, who then does the same for her husband. Vladimir and Sdenka flee from the cottage and go on the run and hide out in the ruins of an abandoned cathedral as dawn breaks. Vladimir is optimistic that a long and happy life lies with them, but Sdenka is reluctant to relinquish her family ties. She believes that she is meant to stay with the family. Sdenka\'s fears about her family are confirmed when that evening, Gorcha and her siblings show up at the abandoned abbey. As Vladimir sleeps, Sdenka is lured into their loving arms where they bite her to death. Awakened by her screams, Vladimir rushes to her aid, but the family has already taken her home, forcing the lover to follow suit. The young nobleman finds her lying motionless on her bed. Sdenka awakens, and a distinct change is visible on her face. No longer caring, Vladimir embraces her, and she bites and infects him as well.  In Victorian London, England, Nurse Helen Chester  is called to a large house to prepare the corpse of an elderly medium for her burial. As she dresses the body, she notices an elaborate sapphire ring on its finger. Tempted by greed, Nurse Chester steals it. As she does, a glass tips over, and drops of water begin to splash on the floor. She is also assailed by a fly, no doubt attracted by the odor of the body. Unsettled but pleased by her acquisition, she finishes the job and returns home to her small East End flat. After returning home, Nurse Chester is assailed by strange events. The buzzing fly returns and continues to pester her. Then the lights in her apartment go out, and the sound of the dripping water continues with maddening regularity. She sees the old woman\'s corpse lying on her bed and coming towards her. The terrified woman begs for forgiveness, but she ultimately strangles herself, imagining that the medium\'s hands are gripping her throat. The next morning, the concierge  discovers Nurse Chester\'s body and calls the police. The investigator on the scene  quickly concludes that it is a simple case and that Nurse Chester "died of fright". The pathologist arrives on the scene to examine the body before it is taken away and notes that the only sign of violence is a small bruise on her left finger, mostly likely caused when someone pried a ring from her finger. As the doctor makes this observation, the concierge appears distressed, for she has apparently taken the ring from the dead Nurse Chester, and is further distracted by the sound of a fly swooping about in the air....'] ['The story plays in the outburst of Hurricane Katrina and centers on a humiliated detective  who gets a sudden shot at salvation when the ghost of a beautiful cellist  solicits his help in finding her killer.Woodbine, Jason, Bean, and Woll Are Planning a LITTLE MURDER'] [';Prologue A young woman, Blanca Trueba , arrives at a house with an old man, whom she leads inside to a chair. The old man asks to be alone. The young woman sits down on the stairs, close to where a little girl is playing, and starts remembering her life. ;Clara and Esteban Blanca\'s mother, Clara del Valle , knew she was in love with Esteban Trueba the first time she saw him, even though she was still a child. Esteban Trueba  had come to propose to Clara\'s sister, Rosa del Valle. Esteban left his fiancée with her family to earn money for their wedding. Clara has special psychic powers and can sometimes foresee the future. One day, she has a vision and tells her sister Rosa that there will be a death in the family. The next day, Rosa dies after drinking poison intended for her father, Senator Severo. Clara blames herself for her sister\'s death, and after watching her sister\'s autopsy, decides never to speak again. Esteban arrives heartbroken at the funeral. At home, his sister, Férula , confronts him saying that he has to work to support her and their sick mother. Esteban leaves for his newly bought hacienda, Tres Marías. He finds many natives living on his land and tells them to work for him for food and shelter. For the next twenty years, Esteban makes Tres Marías an example of a successful Hacienda. He spends some nights with Tránsito, a prostitute (María Conchita Alonso, to whom he borrows money so she can start a new career in the capital. One day he rapes a peasant girl, Pancha García , who works for him. Twenty years later, Esteban receives a letter stating his mother has died. After her funeral, Esteban decides to ask for Clara\'s hand, despite Férula protests that Clara is too sickly and will not take care of him properly. When he shows up at the Del Valle family\'s house, Clara asks him right away if he has come to ask her to marry him, thus speaking again for the first time in twenty years. Esteban confirms he is there to marry Clara. Férula meets Clara at a coffee shop to talk to her about her own future, and Clara, sensing Férula\'s worries, promises her that she can live with her and Esteban in Tres Marías after the wedding and the two will be like sisters. Férula is overwhelmed with happiness, realising she has found a friend in her new sister-in-law, the first person who has been actually kind to her. Sometime later, Férula goes to church to confess that she has strange feelings for Clara. She reports uneasiness when Clara sleeps with Esteban, and also fierce dedication to her sister-in-law. She realises that she is feeling much more for Clara than she should. Esteban senses this and is resentful of Férula\'s interference in his family. Clara\'s parents are killed in a terrible accident on the way to visit their pregnant daughter. Soonafter, Clara gives birth to a girl as she predicted, and names her Blanca. Some years later, Pancha García appears at the family house with her and Esteban\'s bastard teenage son, Esteban García. She asks for money and tells Esteban Trueba that he cannot get rid of her and his son. Esteban Trueba is very annoyed and goes back to play with Blanca . Esteban García comes back to the house later when no one is looking. He finds the child Blanca and begins to molest her. Férula calls Blanca\'s name and Esteban García runs away. Clara has been giving classes to the peasant children and Blanca. Pedro Tercero, the little son of the peasant Segundo at Tres Marias befriends Blanca, and after school she goes out to play with him. The two are gone for hours, and Esteban Trueba, Férula, and Clara start worrying. The two children are eventually found playing in the lagoon. Esteban Trueba does not like that his daughter is playing with a peasant boy and decides to send Blanca to a boarding school. ;Blanca and Pedro Tercero After graduating from school, Blanca returns home to Tres Marías. That night she goes out to the lagoon and meets a grown up Pedro Tercero , and they talk and kiss. That same night, while Esteban attends a political party, there is an earthquake, he worries about Clara and Blanca and drives all the way to Tres Marías and finds that Férula has climbed into bed with Clara. He is so angry that he throws Férula out of the house telling her never to step close to his family again. Clara overhears him threatening his sister and feels sad and disappointed. Sometime later, Esteban brings the French Count Jean de Satigny  to his home intending to arrange a marriage between him and Blanca. Clara senses that the French "nobleman" is a fraud while reading cards but Esteban dismisses her as folly. While Satigny is still visiting, Esteban catches Pedro preaching revolutionary ideas to the peasant people, and punishes him with a fierce whipping and banishing him from Tres Marías. That night at dinner, Férula suddenly appears in the house, kisses Clara on the forehead and leaves again. Clara tells the rest of the family that Férula is dead. Clara and Esteban drive into town to Férula\'s modest house, where they find her dead on the bed. Pedro has returned to Tres Marías and talks to the peasants about their rights and nearly gets shot by Esteban. That night, the Count Jean de Satigny, who is visiting again, watches Blanca and Pedro meeting secretly at the lagoon. He reveals Blanca\'s lover to her father who immediately drags Blanca back to the house. Esteban promises to kill Pedro. When Clara tries to persuade him against violence, Esteban hits his wife and she falls. When Clara rises, she coldly tells him that she will never speak to him again. Clara moves with Blanca to her parents\' house in the capital. Now alone in Tres Marías, Esteban blames Pedro for everything, and offers a reward to anyone who will lead him to Pedro\'s hiding place. Esteban García  takes him to where Pedro is hiding and Esteban tries to kill him, but he is unsuccessful. When García asks for his reward, Esteban Trueba replies that traitors do not get rewards, and García walks away in anger. After Blanca discovers she is pregnant, Esteban tries to force a wedding between Count Jean de Satigny and Blanca, so as to not have any bastards in the family. He tries to convince his daughter by telling her that Pedro Tercero is dead. Blanca angrily refuses, but her mother eventually comforts her by telling her that Pedro is still alive. ;Revolution Some years later, Esteban is busy with his political career, but as an old man he is lonely and finds comfort in the arms of Tránsito, who has actually raised in her profession and is now in a position to pay back Esteban for some money that he lent her, but he prefers to collect the favor another time. He comes to Clara\'s house to apologize and asks her if he can stay with her and to show him his granddaughter Alba whom he has never seen before. Although he moves in with them, Clara still does not talk to him and he constantly keeps feuding with Blanca. While the family is celebrating Alba\'s birthday, Esteban García arrives at their home. Blanca does not recognize the man who abused her as a child. García tells Esteban Trueba that his mother is dead and asks to help him get into the military academy, reminding him of the reward he never received. Trueba writes him a cheque. During the national election, Esteban believes his Conservative Party will win as usual, but the People\'s Front ends up winning control of the government. While Esteban grieves, Blanca goes out on the street to celebrate and to meet Pedro. The two kiss and celebrate together for the rest of the night. A few days later, Pedro is able to meet his daughter Alba for the first time with her mother at an ice-cream parlour. Blanca and Pedro are able to meet regularly now, and things seem to be perfect. Their happiness, however, is short-lived. While Clara are setting up their Christmas tree, she feels she is leaving this world and decides to prepare for death. She gives Alba her notebooks and jewelry to give to Blanca. Kissing Alba goodbye, Clara dies. When Blanca and Esteban arrive home, Alba tells them of Clara\'s death, and the three of them hug and cry together. Meanwhile, a conspiracy between some Conservative Party members and the military leads to a coup d\'état, and the military takes control of the country. At first Esteban believes it is good for the country and that the military will hand power back to the Conservative Party, but he soon learns that the military have other plans. Under the control of the military, people associated with the People\'s Party are captured and even killed. Blanca is highly involved and eventually the police come to arrest her for being with Pedro Tercero. Blanca quiclky reveals to her father that Pedro has been hiding in their house\'s cellar and begs him to help Pedro get out of the country. In the coming days, Blanca is tortured and abused by her half-brother Esteban García, now an important member of the military. She nevertheless refuses to reveal Pedro\'s whereabouts. She is put in a cell where Clara\'s spirit appears to tell her not to wish for death. Meanwhile, Esteban honours his daughter\'s wishes and helps Pedro Tercero find exile in Canada. Esteban then tries to free his daughter from prison, turning to Tránsito, now and influential Madam with lots of connections, who helps free Blanca. One morning a beaten and dirty Blanca arrives at her home. Esteban is shocked to see his daughter in such a state and her wish for revenge against the military, and understands for the first time the consequences of his political actions. ;Epilogue Blanca and Esteban return to Tres Marías with Alba. Esteban is finally visited by Clara\'s spirit who has come to help the old man to the next world. Afterwards, Blanca sits outside and ponders her life, in which she gives up her attempt for revenge and now focuses on Pedro and her daughter Alba. She watches Alba playing in the front door with the leaves swirling in the wind.'] ["Benedict High School's cheerleaders aren't shy and sweet.

At her graduation party, her father, an owner of a demolition company, gives her a gift: a job supervising the demolition of a building in the middle of nowhere. If she\'s successful, she will become his partner. Sam arrives at the Malestrazza Building , and is greeted by Mary , the caretaker. Sam tells Mary she will be staying in one of the apartments in the building. Jimmy , the caretaker\'s teenage son, takes her bags to her apartment and explains the rules of the building. She is to stay off the eighth floor because it is Malestrazza\'s and the roof because it is too dangerous. Sam asks about the building, and Mary is surprised that Sam is not aware of the building\'s history and that it\'s better that she does not know. Sam is curious, and while at the local store she looks on the Internet and finds that the Malestrazza Building was a crime scene where 16 bodies were found entombed in the walls. Since Sam knows the story about the building, Jimmy takes her to the eighth floor and tells her the story. Malestrazza\'s mistake was taking the girl seen at the beginning of the movie. The girl had a puppy, and when the police went to question the architect, the puppy darted into his apartment and led the police to a wall. They found the little girl in the wall. Jimmy is now that puppy\'s owner. The police then locate 15 additional bodies in the walls of the eighth floor. Mary  and her husband were also residents of the apartment building. Mary had to identify her husband, whose face was ripped off by the concrete while she was pregnant with Jimmy. They arrested a disgruntled factory worker for the murders. The lights go out in the abandoned eighth floor, and Sam hurts her leg. In the bathroom, Jimmy cleans her wound and then begins feeling her thigh. Sam asks what he is doing and he realizes his error and stops. Sam has nightmares about being entombed in the walls. Sam\'s boyfriend arrives and admires the building. The arrival of Sam\'s boyfriend upsets Jimmy. Sam and Jimmy have an argument and Jimmy says that after she finishes her report she\'ll leave and forget all about him. To which she replies that she would not. As Sam and her boyfriend explore the 8th floor, they secretly watch Mary at that place where her husband\'s body was found. They eventually talk to Mary, and, when she leaves the apartment, they are both locked in. Looking for a way out, they find a passage way that is not on the blueprints. They travel down the corridor and notice the walls have windows that allow a person to look into all the apartments. Sam realizes that Jimmy was watching her while she was in the bathroom and is upset. They eventually land in a different part of the building and move a false wall where they enter the garbage room and see an exit sign. Mary opens the door and asks if they are done looking through peoples\' garbage. Later that evening, Sam and her boyfriend are in her room having sex. Jimmy is on the other side of the wall listening and feeling distraught. Sam stops in the middle and is worried, aware that Jimmy might be there. Sam\'s boyfriend calms her fears and continues, while Jimmy is behind the wall in agony that Sam is with someone else. The next day they wake up and find Jimmy\'s butchered dog in their apartment. Sam\'s boyfriend thinks Jimmy killed the dog and wants to leave. As they were about to leave, Jimmy gives Sam a gift, Malestrazza\'s journal, which talks about the design of the building and his theories. The building was like the Egyptian pyramids , she also realizes that that is why the building has so much space in the middle and that there is something in the center where light can show all the way down to the basement. Jimmy tells her that he is going to go to the roof to find the light source she is talking about. When Jimmy doesn\'t return, Sam and her boyfriend go to the roof. They find the part of the building she was looking for, a hole in the roof or shaft that leads straight down to the basement. Sam realizes that Jimmy must have known about this and is about to leave when she hears Jimmy call out that he fell down the hole and is hurt and needs Sam to come down and help him. Sam is eventually lowered down the hole by her boyfriend, but at the halfway point her boyfriend is shot with some sort of weapon that looks like a pointed long steel rod. He leans over the hole, holding the rope, as he bleeds down the hole and all over Sam who gets frightened and lets go of the rope and is now hanging upside down as her dead boyfriend bleeds all over her clothes and body. Jimmy then drives Sam\'s car to mail her demolition report and then sinks her car into a lake. Sam awakens in the basement area naked but covered with blankets. She sees a man sitting with a lamp on. Sam finds her clothes and puts them on. She asks the man who he is, but he says that she already knows. She figures out that he is Malestrazza. He plays the tape for her of Jimmy asking for help. Jimmy is keeping her down there with Malestrazza until she learns to love him. Sam also learns that Malestrazza was the mastermind behind the murders and is dumbfounded that people believe that a factory worker could concoct such a scheme of entombing people. She keeps asking about her boyfriend and Malestrazza tries to tell her that he is dead by cutting his arm and saying one mark for every soul. He also tells her that if he does what Jimmy wants, Jimmy is nice, but can be very cruel and imaginative when he disobeys Jimmy\'s orders. Jimmy is back at the hole and sends down a cassette tape. Malestrazza plays the tape, and Jimmy says that he wants to see Sam and Malestrazza dance. Sam reluctantly dances, but, when Jimmy tells them to kiss, Malestrazza smiles showing Sam his blackened teeth, and she protests. Malestrazza pulls her close and forces her to kiss him. After a few seconds, Jimmy tells them to stop and threatens Malestrazza not to touch Sam again. Jimmy then sends down a basket with food, water, and a two-way radio. He tells Sam to keep the radio with her so that they can talk and be close. Later, Jimmy asks his mother \'how do you know when someone really loves you?\'. Mary says that you know when the person is willing to sacrifice everything  for the other person. He then says is that why you sacrificed your son for a dead man. Sam looks for a way to escape and realizes one wall leads to the garbage area. When Jimmy returns, she lies and says that she is hurt and needs medicine. She talks about the time when Jimmy bandaged up her knee and claims that she enjoyed that time and their time together, but that in order to show him all that she can do for him she needs to get out. Sam walks to the center of the room and tell him that this is for him and she removes her shirt. Jimmy looks down and leans back. Sam gets her medicine. She opens the capsules and starts creating a mix to try and blow out the wall to get into the garbage room. Sam\'s attempt fails, and Jimmy is upset that she tried to escape. Before Jimmy could exact his punishment, his mother, Mary, catches him. Mary realizes that Sam is in the hole with Malestrazza. Mary tells Jimmy that place was for the architect not anyone else. She realizes that Sam must stay in the hole with Malestrazza, or else they\'ll take her away and Jimmy will be an orphan. Sam is stuck in the hole with Malestrazza, who she realizes does not want to escape. This is his tomb, and he picked her to kill him. She eventually does kill him after some taunting, and he thanks her after he falls into his tomb and it begins to fill with cement. Sam is by the wall hoping that Jimmy will come through and save her. The demolition team arrives and her father asks where Sam is. Mary tells him that she left. Her father says that he thought she would want to see her first building being demolished. Mary is keeping Jimmy calm as they set up and begin to install the explosives. As the countdown begins, Jimmy starts saying "Sam," and then screams her name and runs toward the building. Sam\'s father tells them to stop the countdown. At the roof, Jimmy looks down, and her father asks what they have done. Jimmy then throws himself over, killing himself, and lands next to Sam. Sam is lifted out of the hole and put in an ambulance. Sam narrates that Malestrazza built 27 buildings, all of which are still standing. He considered the Malestrazza building his masterpiece.'] ['John Milton  is an undead criminal that has broken out of Hell to kill Jonah King ([[Billy_Burke_, a cult leader that tricked Milton\'s daughter into joining his followers in the wake of Milton\'s death, only to kill her and her husband and steal their daughter - Milton\'s granddaughter - to be sacrificed in a Satanist ritual.

Captain Miller  and his crew —Lieutenant Starck , pilot Smith , Medical Technician Peters , Engineer Ensign Justin , Rescue Technician Cooper , and Trauma Doctor D.J.  —are joined for the mission by the Event Horizon\'s designer Dr. William Weir . Dr. Weir briefs the crew that the Event Horizon was built to test an experimental gravity drive which generates an artificial black hole to use the immense gravitational power to bridge two points in spacetime, greatly reducing travel time over astronomical distances. Upon arriving at the ship\'s decaying orbit around Neptune and boarding the Event Horizon to search for survivors, the crew finds evidence of a massacre. During the search, the ship\'s gravity drive activates automatically. Justin is pulled into the resulting portal, returning in a catatonic state. He is later placed in stasis after a failed suicide attempt in apprehension over the events he witnessed during his crossover. The activation of the gravity drive causes a massive shockwave which critically damages the Lewis and Clark and forces the entire crew to board the Event Horizon. The crew then begins experiencing hallucinations of their fears and regrets: Miller sees a subordinate, Corrick, he was forced to abandon in a fire; Peters sees images of her son Denny with his legs covered in bloody lesions; and Dr. Weir, a widower, sees his wife Claire with missing eyes, urging him to join her. After deciphering a warning from a video log of the Event Horizon\'s crew going insane and mutilating each other, Miller and D.J. deduce that while the ship\'s gravity drive did successfully open a gateway in spacetime, it leapt outside the known universe and into another dimension, described later on by Dr. Weir as "a dimension of pure chaos, pure evil" . The Event Horizon has since then gained an evil sentience and telekinetic abilities, tormenting its occupants with the aim of compelling them to return to Hell. Miller decides to destroy the Event Horizon despite objections from Dr. Weir, who is seduced and eventually possessed by the evil presence and uses an explosive device from the Event Horizon to destroy the Lewis and Clark. Smith is killed in the explosion which also launches Cooper out of the ship and into space. Peters dies from a long fall after being lured into the engineering section by an apparition of her son. Dr. Weir kills D.J. by vivisecting him and corners Starck on the bridge. Miller tries to rescue Starck but is caught by Dr. Weir, who activates the ship\'s gravity drive, initiating a ten minute countdown after which the Event Horizon and its passengers will return to the other dimension. Cooper, having used his space suit\'s oxygen to propel him back to the ship, tries to contact those inside, and Dr. Weir retaliates by shooting out the bridge window. Dr. Weir is blown out into space by the ensuing decompression while Miller, Starck, and Cooper survive and manage to seal off the bridge area of the ship. Miller then resolves to detonate the explosives installed on the Event Horizon to split the ship in two and use the forward section of the ship as a lifeboat. He is attacked by manifestations of Corrick and Dr. Weir, who shows Miller horrifying visions of the Lewis and Clark\'s crew being tortured and mutilated once they return to Hell. Miller fights off the manifestation and manages to detonate the explosives, sacrificing himself so Justin, Cooper, and Starck can escape. The gravity drive activates, pulling the rear of the ship into a wormhole. Starck and Cooper join Justin in stasis and wait to be rescued. 72 days later, the Event Horizon is located by a rescue party, who discover the remaining crew still in stasis. Starck has a nightmare of the scarred Dr. Weir being one of the rescuers and is awakened in a distraught state by a rescue team. Cooper restrains Starck and one of the rescuers calls for a sedative as the doors to the stasis room ominously seem to close by themselves.'] ['{{plot}} The opening cards explain that ancient druids worshiped trees, sometimes offering them human sacrifices.

As Diane sits on the ground near a pool of water, her reflection disappears, leaving that of a growling wolf. Three months later, Phil and Kate Sterling move to Los Angeles, where Phil has gotten a job with an advertising agency. Kate reveals to Phil that she is pregnant; they have a baby boy, whom they name Jake. They decide to hire a nanny so that both parents can continue to work. They interview a number of candidates recommended by the Guardian Angel agency. Two seem most suitable: a young woman named Arlene Russell and a caring British woman named Camilla. Later, Arlene is riding down a winding hillside when, suddenly, she hits a pothole and flies off her bike, rolling down the hill to her death. Camilla is hired and quickly becomes an invaluable member of the household, to the point of treating her like family. However, one night, Phil has a nightmare where he sees a wolf attacking Jake. Later in the day, Camilla and Jake are outside when two drunken men attack and chase Camilla into the forest, joined by a third. After knocking Camilla to the ground, the third man slashes her side, and as they attempt to rape her the tree behind them begins to rumble. It comes alive and uses its branches to eviscerate the three men, eating one of them. Camilla sits on a branch above the ground, cradling the baby, while wolves devour one of the men. A giant spike impales the last man, before he is engulfed in flames. Kate and Phil throw a dinner party, attended by Ned, their neighbor and the architect of the house, and Phil\'s bosses from work. During dinner, the conversation turns to Camilla, and how wonderful she is to have around. Later in the evening, Ned, who has taken a liking to Camilla, invites her to his house the following evening; she politely declines. Phil dreams of having sex with Kate, who suddenly turns into Camilla. The following night, Kate helps Camilla get dressed up for some window shopping in town. After she leaves, Ned arrives with a bouquet of flowers for Camilla. Kate encourages him to go after Camilla; Ned hops into his truck and catches sight of Camilla heading into the forest. Ned follows on foot, and eventually finds her bathing in the creek. Suddenly she vanishes, reappearing on the giant tree. As she lies naked on a branch, she begins to fuse with the tree bark. Ned is discovered by the pack of wolves, and flees back to his house. While trying to call the police, his phone cuts out. After locking all the doors, he calls Phil and Kate, and leaves a rambling, panicky message about what he saw in the forest. The wolves break into the house; Ned runs into the living room and sees Camilla, naked and ashen, on the hearth. She tells him: "You shouldn\'t have followed me." Ned tries to make a last stand in the basement, but the wolves attack and rip him apart. Camilla drags Ned\'s body away, and magically makes all traces of his death disappear. Phil wakes up in the night and sees the answering machine beeping. The first message is from a stranger, Molly Sheridan. After leaving her phone number, she says that it is urgent she and Phil speak. As Phil begins to hear the message from Ned, Camilla enters and tells Phil he needs to look at Jake. She points out that he looks pale, and Phil insists they call a doctor, despite protest from Camilla. The following day, Phil goes to the Sheridan house, meeting Molly and her son Scotty. Molly describes the disappearance of her baby daughter and how the police cannot seem to find the nanny Diane, nor any evidence that she even exists. She begs Phil to arrange for her to see Camilla, suspecting she is really Diane. Returning home, Phil searches the house for Camilla. Finding no one, he listens again to the message Ned left, warning Phil and Kate not to let Camilla back into their house. Phil rushes over to Ned\'s house, and finds the door wide open, but no one inside. At home, he finds Camilla sitting on the couch with the baby, and asks her where she was. Saying she had taken the baby to the zoo, Phil demands to know why she had not taken Jake to the doctor. He plays Ned\'s message for Kate, and confronts Camilla. He tells her that he tried calling her references, none of which exist, and that he met Molly Sheridan, whose baby was abducted a year ago by a woman from Guardian Angel. He also checked with them, to find out that while Camilla is registered, she was not recommended to the Sterlings. As Phil throws Camilla\'s things into her trunk, Kate says there is something wrong with the baby. They take him to the doctor, who tells them he is displaying coma-like symptoms. At the hospital, Jake awakens, and Phil rushes off to find the doctor. Camilla suddenly appears in the hospital room. She tells Kate that the baby needs her, and she him. She then tries to leave with the baby, when Phil blocks her path. He grabs Jake and knocks Camilla to the ground. The Sterlings leave the hospital and head home, to find a wolf standing guard inside. As they slam the door on it, more wolves surround them. Fleeing around the back of the house, Kate and Phil become separated when Phil makes her close the gate behind her. Kate screams to Phil that they want the baby. She gets into her Jeep and manages to escape the attacking wolves. Phil, who has taken Jake and hidden in the woods, is followed by Camilla. He runs as Camilla rises into the air and floats after him. Kate drives to the forest as Phil finds his path blocked by a giant tree;, Camilla is about to strike when Kate hits her with the jeep. As Phil looks over Camilla\'s body on the tree, he sees all the faces of previous babies which have been sacrificed to it. Kate and Phil decide to leave the house for good. Phil takes a chainsaw and goes looking for the tree. Back at the house, Kate is attacked by a part-tree, part-human Camilla. As Phil approaches the tree, it wraps a branch around his leg. Using the chainsaw, he slices the branch, which begins to bleed. Camilla chases Kate onto the stairs, and grabs her ankle, causing Jake to fly from her arms onto the upstairs landing. Phil begins attacking the tree itself; as he does patches of skin start to fall of Camilla as well. Camilla drags Kate down the stairs and throws her into the living room. As Camilla approaches Jake, Phil chops off a large branch from the tree, causing Camilla\'s entire leg to sever from her body. Kate, seeing this, rushes upstairs, pushing Camilla out the window. As she falls towards the ground, the tree begins to fall and explodes before landing, killing Camilla as well. Phil arrives back at the house, and finds Kate holding Jake.'] ["The film opens by following a moody goth named Reese, who befriends three other outcasts like him: Zack a rich nerd, Ashley who is Zack's sister and Phoebe a flower child.

An American, Lamont Cranston , has succumbed to his darker instincts during the war. He then vanished into the Orient, where he exists as a brutal warlord and opium kingpin under the alias of Yin-Ko .{{cn}} One night he is abducted from his palace by servants of the Tulku , a holy man who exhibits otherworldly powers and knows Cranston\'s identity. He informs Cranston that he will become a force for good. Cranston objects but is silenced by the Phurba , a mystical living knife that assaults Cranston, wounding him. Cranston is unable to refuse and remains under the tutelage of the Tulku for seven years. He learns to "cloud men\'s minds", a form of hypnosis that allows him to influence others\' thoughts and bend their perceptions so he cannot be seen. Cranston returns to New York and resumes his previous life. No one is aware of his past in the East; he is seen as a shallow and opulent playboy. He operates as The Shadow, a vigilante that terrorizes the underworld. Citizens who are saved by the Shadow are recruited to be his allies, providing him with informants and specialists. The existence of The Shadow is regarded by the public as nothing more than an urban legend. The Shadow\'s secret is endangered when Cranston meets Margot Lane , an eccentric socialite who is also a natural telepath. He is intrigued, but unable to continue seeing her as he cannot keep his thoughts from her. Cranston is challenged by Shiwan Khan , another student of the Tulku who possesses even sharper powers but did not turn to good. Khan is the last descendant of Genghis Khan and plans to fulfill his ancestor\'s goal of world domination. He offers Cranston an alliance, sensing that bloodlust and a thirst for power still exists in his heart, but Cranston refuses. Cranston acquires a rare coin from Khan and learns that it is made of a metal called bronzium that theoretically can generate an explosion large enough to destroy a city. This suspicion is confirmed when he learns that Margot\'s father Reinhardt , an atomic scientist working for the War Department, has vanished. Shiwan Khan hypnotizes Margot Lane and sends her after Cranston, hoping to force him to kill her and reawaken his darker side, but the attempt is unsuccessful. Cranston breaks Khan\'s hold on her but she is now aware of his secret identity. Cranston goes to rescue Reinhardt but is thwarted by several of Khan\'s henchmen. The Shadow suffers another setback when he confronts Reinhardt\'s former assistant Farley Claymore , who has joined Khan\'s forces. Claymore traps the Shadow in a submersion tank, but he saves himself by mentally summoning Margot. The Shadow learns of Khan\'s hideout: the luxurious Hotel Monolith, a building in the middle of the city that Shiwan Khan has rendered invisible; it appears to everyone as an empty lot. Knowing that Khan has Reinhardt hostage and the completed bomb in his possession, he infiltrates the hotel for a final showdown. The Shadow fights his way through the hotel, killing Claymore and Khan\'s warriors. He faces Khan and is subdued by the Phurba, sustaining multiple injuries until he forces himself to concentrate and overcome Khan\'s power. He takes control of the Phurba and sends it into Khan\'s torso, splitting his concentration which undoes both Reinhardt\'s hypnotic state and the hotel\'s invisibility. As the citizens outside see a building appear, the Shadow pursues Khan into the bowels of the building while Margot and Reinhardt disable the bomb. The Shadow defeats Khan by psychically hurling a mirror shard into his skull. Khan awakens in an asylum, confused as to how he got there and discovering that his powers no longer work. He learns that the doctors saved his life by removing the part of his brain that harbored his psychic abilities. He demands to be set free, but is ignored along with the rants of the other inmates. Unknown to him, the doctor is an agent of the Shadow who has ensured that Khan is no longer a threat.'] ['Mike Enslin  is a skeptical author who, after the death of his daughter Katie , writes books appraising supernatural events he has no belief in. After his latest book, he receives an anonymous postcard depicting The Dolphin, a hotel on Lexington Avenue in New York City, bearing the message "Don\'t enter 1408". Viewing this as a challenge, Mike forces the hotel to allow him to book a stay in the room. After arriving at the Dolphin, Mike is pulled aside by the hotel manager, Gerald Olin . Olin tries to bribe him with cognac, information files and a free upgrade to a luxurious suite to refuse to enter the room. Mike refuses. Olin takes him to his office and explains to Mike that in the hotel\'s 95-year history, 56 deaths have occurred in 1408, no one survived over the hour. Mike still refuses to leave, and Olin reluctantly escorts him to the 14th floor. Once inside the room, Mike records on his mini-cassette the room\'s dull appearance and its unimpressive lack of supernatural phenomena. During his examination, the clock radio suddenly starts playing "We\'ve Only Just Begun", but Mike assumes this is a trick of Olin\'s. At 8:07, the song plays again and the clock\'s digital display changes to a countdown starting from "60:00". Mike begins to experience supernatural events, including the window slamming down on his hand, the hotel operator calling about food he didn\'t order, and spectral hallucinations of the room\'s past victims as well as of his family, particularly his daughter. Mike\'s attempts to leave the room are in vain; the doorknob breaks off the door, climbing through the air ducts prompts an escape from the corpse of a former room victim, and climbing onto the window ledge reveals the windows of the other rooms are gone. Mike uses his laptop to contact his estranged wife Lily, but the sprinkler system shorts out his laptop. The room temperature drops to subzero when the laptop suddenly begins to work again, and Lily tells him the police have entered 1408, but the room is empty. A doppelgänger of Mike appears in the chat window and urges Lily to come to the hotel herself. The room shakes violently and Mike breaks a picture of a ship in a storm, flooding the room. He surfaces on a beach, the result of a surfing accident earlier in the film, and after returning to a normal life and reconciling with Lily, he assumes it was all a dream. Lily persuades him to write a book about it, but when visiting the post office to send the manuscript to his publisher, he recognizes a construction crew as the hotel staff, and they destroy the post office to reveal Mike is still trapped in 1408, the walls now burnt and broken. A vision of Katie appears to Mike, and after some reluctance, he embraces her before she crumbles to dust. Mike hears the clock radio begin to play and looks for it in the rubble, seeing it count down the final seconds. When the countdown ends, the room is suddenly restored to normal, and the clock radio resets itself to 60:00. The "hotel operator" calls Mike again, and informs him that he can relive the hour over and over again, or take his own life. Mike sees a hangman\'s noose and has a vision of himself hanged, but refuses. Mike uses the bottle of cognac from Olin to make a Molotov cocktail and sets the room on fire. The hotel is evacuated and Lily is prevented from entering as fire fighters enter the scorched room, pulling Mike to safety. As Mike recovers with Lily at his bedside, he tells her about Katie, but Lily doesn\'t believe him. The two reconcile and Mike moves back in with Lily. During the move, Lily finds a box of items retrieved from the rubble of 1408. Mike retrieves his tape recorder and after some tinkering, gets it to play. As Lily unpacks their stuff, he replays at the conversation with him and Katie. Lily overhears the record and drops the boxes, staring at the tape in shock. Mike stares at her grimly, as the scene blacks out.  Director Mikael Håfström has stated that the ending for 1408 was reshot because test audiences felt that the original ending was too much of a "downer".http://www.cinemablend.com/dvdnews/Advance-Hint-At-1408-DVD-Contents-4676.html Advance Hint At 1408 DVD Contents - DVD News In the original ending, Mike dies in the fire, happy to see the room destroyed. During Mike\'s funeral, Olin approaches Lily and Mike\'s agent where he unsuccessfully attempts to give her a box of Mike\'s possessions, including the tape recorder. Before being cut off, Olin claims that the room was successfully destroyed and that it will no longer harm anyone ever again, which is why he claims "Mike did not die in vain". Olin listens to the recording in his car, becoming visibly upset when he hears Katie\'s voice on the tape. He looks in the car mirror and sees a glimpse of Enslin\'s burnt corpse in the backseat. Olin places the tape recorder back in the box and drives off. The film ends at the gutted room, with an apparition of Mike looking out the window and smoking a cigarette. He hears his daughter calling his name, and disappears as he walks towards the room\'s door. A sound of a door closing is heard and the screen blacks out. The alternative ending is the default ending on the Blu-ray release and two-disk collector\'s edition. Canadian networks Space and The Movie Network broadcast this version of the film, as does U.S. network FX, although Space did broadcast the original ending version on July 23, 2012. The UK and Australian DVD and U.S. iTunes version also use this ending.'] ['Successful businessman Melvin Dovereux is caught in a traffic jam caused by a funeral procession.

They suspect its inhabitant, Joseph Curwen, of being a warlock. One stormy night, a young girl from the town wanders up to the Curwen palace in a trance-like state, and is led by Curwen and his mistress, Hester, down in to the dungeons of the palace. The girl is then subjected to a strange ritual, where an unseen creature rises up from a covered pit below her, in wreaths of green smoke. The townspeople, however, observe the girl wandering off in to the night, and storm up to the Curwen palace to confront its mysterious owner. Though the girl appears unharmed, the townspeople deign that she has been bewitched to forget what happened to her, and drag Curwen out to a tree where they intend to burn him. However, the leader of the mob, Ezra Weeden, insists that they do not harm Curwen's mistress Hester  Before dying, Curwen puts a curse on Arkham and its inhabitants, saying he will rise from the grave to take his revenge on the descendants of the five men who burned him - Ezra Weeden, Mikus Smith, Benjamin West, Priam Willet, and Gideon Leach. In 1875, 110 years later, Charles Dexter Ward and his wife Anne arrive in Arkham after inheriting the palace from Charles' great great grandfather, Joseph Curwen. They are confused to find the townsfolk wary and even hostile towards them, and are particularly disturbed by the horrific deformities that afflict many of Arkham's inhabitants. Up at the palace, Charles is surprised by how well he seems to know the old house, and is also struck by the strong resemblance between him and a portrait of Curwen above the fireplace. He and Anne meet Simon, the peculiar palace caretaker, who persuades them to stay at the palace for a while, and not to be scared of the townspeoples' hostility towards them. During their stay, Charles becomes more and more obsessed with the portrait of Curwen, and at times seems to change in his personality. Charles and Anne befriend the local doctor, Dr. Willet  and he explains to them that the townspeople blame the many deformities plagueing the town on Curwen's curse. He tells them of a legendary black magic book, known as the Necronomicon, which was believed to be in Curwen's possession, and which Curwen apparently used to summon the Elder Gods, Cthulhu, Yog-Sothoth, and other dark creatures. Curwen's plan was to mate mortal women with these beings in order to create a new race of super-humans, which apparently led to the many disfigured people of Arkham. The townspeople are now terrified that Curwen has come back in the form of Charles to seek his revenge against the people who killed him. Dr. Willet finally advises Charles and Anne to leave the town. Despite Anne's eagerness to leave, Charles seems to be falling under the control of something, and insists that they stay in Arkham. One night, Charles finally succumbs to the spirit of Joseph Curwen, and becomes possessed by him. Curwen is then reunited with his two assistants, Simon and Jabez  and the three hastily make plans to continue their work and resurrect Hester. Curwen's hold on Charles, however, is limited, and he tells Simon and Jabez that Charles' will is fighting against him. Anne, frightened by the changes in her husband, seeks help from Dr. Willet, but Curwen manages to convince Dr. Willet that Anne is mad. Meanwhile, Curwen begins enacting his revenge on the descendants of the mob that burned him alive. He kills Weeden's descendant by releasing Weeden's monstrously deformed son from his locked room, and then attacks Leach's descendant with fire. The townspeople discover Leach's charred corpse, and decide to take matters in to their own hands, banding together to storm the palace and find Curwen. Dr. Willet and Anne race to try and save Charles, unaware that Curwen has now taken complete control of him, and that Curwen, Simon, and Jabez have finally succeeded in resurrecting Hester. Dr. Willet and Anne discover the secret entrance to the palace dungeons, and are ambushed by Curwen, Simon, Jabez, and Hester. Anne is offered as a sacrifice to the otherworldly creature that lives in the pit beneath the palace, while the residents of Arkham break in and begin to burn the palace down. The portrait of Curwen is destroyed, apparently breaking Curwen's hold over Charles. With his mind finally restored, Charles rushes down and releases Anne, then urges Dr. Willet to save her, while Curwen's associates pin him down. Dr. Willet helps Anne to escape from the burning palace, before running back to rescue Charles, finding Simon, Jabez, and Hester gone. The two of them barely manage to escape the flames, and Charles and Anne fervently thank Dr. Willet for saving their lives. As Charles turns towards the camera, however, it is made apparent to the viewers that Joseph Curwen still inhabits his mind.

The woman complies, until she notices the driver hiding in her yard. She tries to kill him with her shotgun, but in the process, the driver attacks her and pursues Trish and Darry once again. Trish manages to hit the mysterious driver with their car, and run him over several times. After crushing his body and seemingly killing him, they are horrified to see a giant wing tear through the driver\'s trenchcoat and flap frantically in the air. Leaving it on the road, they drive to the local police station to wait for their parents, when they receive another visitor; Jezelle Gay Hartman. She reveals herself as the woman who phoned Darry and Trish previously at the diner. Jezelle tells them the true nature of the mysterious creature: it is an ancient immortal demon known as the "The Creeper", which hunts every twenty-third spring for twenty three days to feast on human body parts which, upon consumption, form part of its own body. She also tells them that it seeks out its victims through fear, and that by smelling the fear from Trish and Darry, it has found something it likes, but she does not know what. The wounded Creeper attacks the police station and gains entrance to the cells. Jezelle, Trish and Darry attempt to escape but find themselves trapped. Jezelle warns that one of them will die a horrible death, while the song "Jeepers Creepers" plays on a phonograph in the background. Darry demands to know which one of them, and she looks to Trish. The three are then discovered by the Creeper, and are separated. The Creeper heads towards Jezelle and sniffs her intently, but lets her go, and heads off to find Trish and Darry. After a lengthy chase, the Creeper corners both Trish and Darry in an upstairs room. After sniffing  them, the Creeper throws Trish aside and chooses Darry. Trish tries to reason with it, and offers to give her life for her brother\'s. The police burst in and take aim, but the Creeper escapes out the window, flying away with Darry. The next day, Trish, contemplating Darry\'s fate, is picked up by her parents, and Jezelle returns home in regret. The final scene shows the Creeper in its new hideout, an abandoned factory, where the audience finally learns what the Creeper wanted: by ripping out the back of Darry\'s head, it has taken his eyes, leaving Darry\'s body an eyeless, motionless corpse, while "Jeepers Creepers" is playing in the background. The film ends with Creeper looking at the audience through Darry\'s eye socket, now with Darry\'s brown eyes. In a brief post-credits scene, the Creeper\'s truck is shown hurtling down the road at sunset, blaring its horn.'] ["The film is set in the fictional Utah community of Santa Ynez. Two bicyclists are cycling on the canyon, and a mysterious black car is following them down the road. At the bridge, the car rams them at the back, causing them to fly over the bridge, killing them on the spot. The police is called to the first of a series of hit and run deaths, apparently caused by the same car that appears heavily customized and has no license plate, making identification difficult. Sheriff Everett Peck  gets a lead on the car when it is witnessed by Amos Clemens  after it runs over a hitchhiker. After the car claims the sheriff as its fourth victim while trying to kill Amos, it becomes the job of Captain Wade Parent  to stop the deaths. During the resulting investigation, an eyewitness to the accident states that there was no driver inside the vehicle. Despite a police cordon being placed around all roads in the area, the car enters town and attacks the school marching band as it rehearses at the local show ground. It chases the group of teachers and students, among them Wade's girlfriend Lauren , into a cemetery. Curiously enough, the machine will not enter onto the consecrated ground as Lauren taunts the purported driver that any of the townsfolk have yet to see. Seemingly in anger, the car destroys a brick gate post and leaves. The police chase the automobile along highways throughout the desert before it turns on them, destroying several squad cars and killing five officers in the process. Wade confronts the vehicle and is surprised to see that none of his bullets put a dent on the car's windshield or tires. After trying to open the door, Wade is injured, and the car escapes. The hunt for the car becomes a personal vendetta for Wade when the automobile stalks and eliminates Lauren by driving straight through her house, right when he is speaking to her over the phone. Wade's deputy Luke  puts forward the theory that it acted in revenge for the insults hurled on it by Lauren and notes it cannot enter hallowed ground. Wade concocts a plan to stop the car by burying it beneath a controlled explosion in the canyons that lie outside of town. After discovering it waiting for him in his own garage, he is forced to carry out his plans post haste. He is pursued by the car into a mountainous canyon area where his fellow officers have set a trap for the machine, and a final confrontation settles the score with a demonic visage appearing in the smoke and fire of the explosion, shocking the police officers. The final scenes show Wade refusing to believe what the group saw in the flames, despite Deputy Johnson's insistence about what he saw. The film concludes, in some cuts, with the car prowling city streets, clearly having survived."] ['As the film begins, we see an unknown person in a dark boiler room create a glove with razor-sharp knives embedded in the fingers. High school student Tina Gray  has a disturbing nightmare in which she is stalked through the boiler room by a severely burned figure with the bladed glove on his right hand. When he finally catches her, she awakens screaming in her own bed. However her nightgown has four slashes in it, identical to the ones given to her in the dream by the unknown man\'s razors, and is less than convinced it was just a nightmare. The next day, Nancy Thompson  recalls a nursery rhyme from Tina\'s description when they meet up with Nancy\'s boyfriend, Glen Lantz . Tina\'s boyfriend Rod Lane  shows up as well. Nancy admits she also had a bad dream and all of them dismiss the topic of the nightmare, though Tina is visibly disturbed. That night, Nancy and Glen go to Tina\'s house because her mother is out of town and Tina is still troubled by her nightmare. Tina describes the killer in her dream, which intrigues Nancy who adds to the description having seen the same killer herself, also getting Glen\'s silent attention. Rod crashes the party and he and Tina have sex while Glen and Nancy sleep in adjoining rooms. Rod also tells Tina he\'s been having nightmares, but neither of them think about it and go to sleep. Once asleep, Tina is once again stalked by the hideous figure, who taunts her repeatedly before attacking. This time, he catches and murders her. Her struggles awaken Rod who watches Tina get slashed by the glove and dragged up the wall and across the ceiling, screaming his name and alerting the others before she falls dead onto the bed. Because Rod was the only one in the same room as Tina, he is suspected of the murder and is arrested the next day. While at school, Nancy has a terrifying nightmare in class where she is attacked by the same figure that killed Tina. Nancy leaves the school early and goes to the jail to talk to Rod, who describes what he saw the night Tina was killed, which reminded him of his own nightmares where he was also stalked by the figure wearing the glove. To her shock, Nancy realizes that Rod did not kill Tina and leaves. Later, she begs Glen to watch her while she sleeps so she can investigate her dreams further. Glen hesitates, but accepts. When Nancy goes to sleep, she sees the killer enter Rod\'s jail cell and suspects that Rod is in danger. When she wakes up, she and Glen rush to the police station only to find Rod dead, hung by his own bed sheets. Everybody, except Nancy, believes that he committed suicide. At Rod\'s funeral, Nancy\'s mother, Marge Thompson  insists on getting her psychiatric help. But while at the clinic to evaluate her dreams, she has a violent encounter and awakens with a streak of white in her hair. Much to her horror, she also pulls the killer\'s battered hat out of the dream with her, which she recognizes. Marge begins to drink heavily and installs security bars on all the windows and the door. She reveals to Nancy that the owner of the hat and the burned figure from her nightmares is a man named Freddy Krueger . Years ago, he was arrested after murdering 20 children, but due to a technicality , he was released. Soon after, the enraged parents of the murdered children took the law into their hands by burning Freddy alive. It now appears that he is exacting revenge against the parents that killed him from beyond the grave by killing their children from within their dreams. Nancy tells this to Glen, who advises her to turn her back on her fear and to take the energy of the killer away from him, but she plans to pull Freddy from the dreamworld where she and Glen can gang up on him and surrender him to the authorities. However, both Glen and Nancy\'s parents lock them inside their respective houses, keeping them from meeting. Glen later falls asleep and is killed when Freddy pulls him into his bed and he is regurgitated as a geyser of blood. Nancy then receives a phone call from Freddy, who tells her: "I\'m your boyfriend now, Nancy.", indicating that he has killed Glen. Still unable to get her father to believe her, she tells Don to break down the door of her house in 20 minutes and then goes to sleep to hunt down Freddy. She finds him in her last few minutes of sleep and gets hold of him when her alarm goes off. When she doesn\'t see him at first, she thinks she\'s gone crazy, but Freddy eventually appears, and the two face-off. Nancy proves to be a match for him, setting up several booby traps and making him fall into every one, then lighting him on fire and trapping him in the basement to call her father. Don and his department arrive to put out the fires. He and Nancy then follow a trail of footsteps up to Marge\'s room and discover Freddy smothering her with his flaming body. They knock him out but he disappears, leaving the body of Marge Thompson vanishing slowly into the bed. Nancy sends her father from the room and turns her back as Freddy rises from the bed. She proclaims she is no longer afraid of him, causing him to lose his powers. Freddy lunges forward as she walks out of the room and vanishes. Nancy steps out into daylight from her front door and her mother appears well and sober, promising to stop drinking as her friends pull up in Glen\'s car. Suddenly, the roof clamps shut; the material an exact match to Freddy\'s sweater; and the car starts moving of its own accord. The film ends with Nancy screaming as she is driven off with her friends and we see Freddy pull Marge through the front door\'s window.'] ["The film is set during 1941  in World War II Berlin. A scientist named Dr. Hess is forced by the Nazis, especially his Gestapo liaison Major Kraus, to create a drug capable of animating corpses to use as living shields on the battlefield, but cannot get it right: While the corpses do reanimate, they have a tendency towards mindless violence. In a small theater downtown, Andre Toulon has set up a politically satirical puppet show for children, starring a six-armed American Old West puppet named Six Shooter, who attacks an inanimate reconstruction{{disambiguation needed}} puppet of Adolf Hitler. The show is, next to a crowd of children, also attended by Lt. Erich Stein, Kraus' driver. After the performance, Toulon and his wife Elsa feed the puppets with the formula which sustains their life force, but they are watched by Stein, who informs his superior the next morning. Hess, genuinely fascinated by the formula, wants Toulon to freely share the secret with him, but Kraus wants to take Toulon in for treason. The next day, Andre gives Elsa a puppet crafted in her likeness as a gift, but soon afterwards Kraus, Hess and a squad of soldiers break into the atelier and take Toulon, Tunneler, and Pinhead. When Elsa attempts to prevent them from taking the formula as well, she is shot by one of the escort, and Toulon is dragged away from her. When Kraus prepares to leave, the wounded Elsa spits at him in defiance, and in retaliation, Kraus cold-bloodedly shoots her dead. However, while transporting Toulon off, the two soldiers guarding him are killed by Pinhead and Tunneler, enabling Toulon to escape. After hiding for the remainder of the night, Toulon returns to his theater to find that the stage has been burnt by the Nazis. He finds Six Shooter and Jester and leaves with them, then discovers a partially destroyed hospital and decides to set up camp in it. Toulon wants revenge, so he, Pinhead and Jester break into the morgue to get his wife's life essence and inserts it into the woman puppet he made for her, and as she comes to life, he inserts several leeches he found in a jar into her. Later that night, Toulon carries out the first revenge attack on Stein while he fixes Kraus' car, along with Pinhead, Jester and Leech Woman, and on his flight from pursuers Toulon subsequently finds shelter in a bombed-out building. Back in his lab, Dr. Hess is studying Toulon's formula, and desperate to meet and talk with him, he goes back to the old theater. Meanwhile, some friends from the puppet show, a boy named Peter Hertz and his father, find Andre and decide to live with him after Peter's mother was arrested on charges of espionage. The next day, Toulon sends Six Shooter to kill General Müller, the supervisor of the Nazi reanimation project, while Müller is visiting a brothel. While Six Shooter manages to kill the general, Müller shoots off one of the puppet's arms beforehand. Peter goes back to Toulon's old atelier to look for a replacement arm and is caught by Dr. Hess, who treats him kindly and gets him to take him to Toulon. Dr. Hess finds and talks to Toulon, who tells him about the puppets' secret, and the two become friends. But Peter's father betrays Toulon by telling Major Kraus about his hideout in exchange for a pardon for his family. Kraus and his men storm the ruin, but the puppets fight back, enabling Toulon and Hess to escape. Kraus stops Peter and his father, demanding to know where Toulon is; Hertz fights against and is shot by Kraus. While searching the nearby houses, one of Kraus' men is shot by Six Shooter; but when Hess approaches him, the soldier puts a knife into him before expiring. Hess dies from the injury, telling Toulon to keep fighting. Toulon returns once more to his old theater, where he falls asleep from exhaustion and is soon joined by the now orphaned Peter. At night, Major Kraus returns to his office, only to fall prey to an ambush by Toulon and his puppets, now joined by Blade, infused with Hess' essence. Toulon takes terrible revenge on Kraus by hanging him from the ceiling by his limbs and neck, which are impaled by sharp hooks. After having a halberd from Kraus' office decorations planted into the floor, point up, Toulon sets the rope on fire; the rope eventually snaps, and Kraus falls fatally right onto the halberd. The film ends with Toulon, posing as Kraus, and Peter leaving the country for Geneva on the express train."] ['{{Plot}} The film begins with a college sorority initiation ceremony, in which the sorority president tries to stab a pledge in the heart, but the knife mysteriously stops in mid-air. Eighteen years later, Trina Goodwin , and her twin daughters, Sarah  and Lindsay , are driving up to Temple Hill University, where Sarah and Lindsay are starting their first semester. Along the tour, they notice a "weird" house, Pi Epsilon Delta, , and after that, they see the house they want to pledge the most, Alpha Nu Gamma. Sarah meets a girl named Vita in a bathroom, and they become good friends, while Sarah  forces other girls to apologize to Vita -and give her their shampoo-, for mocking her earlier. Then Sarah goes into a stall, and removes her many bracelets, revealing cuts on her wrists. Later on, Sarah and Lindsay meet their Student-Advisor, Finn , who delivers them two invitations to Pi Epsilon Delta for a Rushing Ceremony. At the party, Lindsay ends up having a nice time, while Sarah can\'t wait to leave. But before they do, Sarah meets the Alpha Nu President, Corrine . When they shake hands, Corrine\'s glass of punch spills all over her own dress. Sarah leaves in tears, apologizing to Corrine, and Lindsay follows. After a long talk, and a few apologies, Lindsay trips and breaks her ankle on a tree root in front of the Pi Epsilon Delta house. The girls in the house look after Lindsay, while Sarah meets Dr. Eugenia Hunter , the president of P.E.D. After a short while, Lindsay\'s ankle heals extremely fast. As the girls are leaving, Sarah asks Hunter why she invited them. Dr. Hunter claims she was a friend of her mother. The next day, Lindsay is ecstatic to find out that both she and Sarah were asked back to Alpha Nu, and Sarah also received another invitation to P.E.D., but they decide to go to Alpha Nu Gamma, where they meet with Corrine, who promises to put in a good word for Lindsay about a guy she saw  while she brushes an eyelash off Lindsay. A while later, in Sarah and Finn\'s European Mysticism class,  Dr. Hunter mentions to Sarah that she knows Sarah has magical powers, and so does she. Sarah, shocked, leaves and walks into Corrine, who cheers her up. In the evening, Sarah goes to Finn\'s room to borrow notes, but before she can get there, Corrine meets him first and says she was double-dared to introduce herself to "the hottest guy I\'ve never met" and have sex with him. Sarah catches them and leaves, followed by Corrine. Moments later, it is revealed that Corrine never saw Finn: It was Dr. Hunter who had glamored herself to look like Corrine. The next day, Sarah unintentionally uses her powers on Corrine and pushes her into a muddy ditch, then goes to see Dr. Hunter, who tells her that Alpha Nu and P.E.D. are not only lifelong rivals, but mortal enemies, fighting Good versus Evil. Sarah\'s powers, which mark her as "the One", could disrupt the balance, and Alpha Nu wants to sacrifice her to the Eternal Flame so they will live and stay out of Hell. Later, Sarah tells Lindsay what she learned, and Lindsay angrily claims that ever since the day they were born it was always about Sarah, and never about her. She leaves in tears, refusing to believe anything. Back at Alpha Nu, for a minute, we see Corrine\'s true form, as an old woman, who shape-shifts into a beautiful 21 year old college student. Esme , the Alpha Nu vice president, warns Corrine of the fight between Sarah, and Lindsay. Corrine devices a plan, and while doing so, she reveals The Knife of Truth, . She uses the eyelash she took from Lindsay to brew a potion, and used it to make the man she likes, After Lindsay realizes it was all a gag, she confronts Esme, and Corrine, who show her what she wants the most in her life,  and they promise to make her look as full-figured as she wants, if she joins. Back at their dormitory, Sarah is packing all of her belonging, saying she wants to leave, but Lindsay refuses, and wants to join Alpha Nu. Suddenly, a fire starts in their dormitory,  and Sarah at first uses heavy pillows, and coffee to put it out, but it only makes the fire grow. Sarah eventually, uses her magic to put out the fire, and it works. But the entire dormitory is declared uninhabitable by smoke-damage. Lindsay moves out leaving Sarah, and joins Alpha Nu. While Sarah sleeps in P.E.D. with her friend, Vita, who was initiated into P.E.D. The next day, Sarah and Vita become more acquainted. Sarah meets up with Finn, and they patch up their relationship, and Sarah sees Lindsay, taller, and more full-figured. Corrine offers to do the same for Sarah, if she joins. But Sarah refuses. After, Lindsay is confronted by Esme, and told that she\'s had it very nicely compared to the other pledges. She is told, "sacrifices has to be made." And Lindsay swears to do whatever she\'s told. In P.E.D.. Sarah is practicing her magic with Dr. Hunter. After a while, Dr. Hunter tells Sarah all about what Alpha Nu is trying to do, and what they will do, if Sarah doesn\'t pledge Alpha Nu. "Most likely, they\'ll just try to kill you, so we can\'t have you." And mentions how it all began, eighteen years earlier. When, both Alpha Nu, and herself thought that Sarah\'s mother was the One, but in the middle of the sacrifice, the knife refused to cut her. It was because she wasn\'t the One. She was pregnant, with twins,  and that the woman in the beginning was Sarah\'s real mother, not Trina Goodwin. Later, at Alpha Nu, Trina Goodwin is called to the Sorority House. In a fit of rage, she reveals that she killed Sarah and Lindsay\'s mother with her bare hands, and refuses to let Sarah not be initiated, and let all her 18 years of raising the girls go to waste. The next day, at the Library, Sarah tries, once more to convince Lindsay to leave together, but Lindsay refuses. Soon after, Esme attacks Sarah, and mentions that until Sarah pledges, she will throw every possible virgin into the fire to keep it alive, and that countless lives will be gone because of her. Sarah escapes, but sees that Finn is gone. She runs to the Alpha Nu house, and sees Finn tied up, and gagged. She sneaks into he house to look for him, but is caught by Lindsay, who apologizes to her and admits to being wrong about everything, and warns Sarah of a trap waiting for her. Sarah begs for Lindsay\'s help. Lindsay says that Finn is in the basement, and shows her the way. When Sarah frees Finn, Lindsay says that this was the trap, following the entrance of Corrine, and Esme. Corrine takes out the Knife of Truth, and puts it at Lindsay\'s throat. She offers Sarah the chance to offer herself willingly, and if she refuses, she will cut Lindsay\'s throat. Sarah uses her magic to snatch the knife, and put it at Esme\'s throat. Sarah says she will do it. Suddenly a drop of blood falls from the Knife, and hits the floor, causing the Eternal Flame to rise and roar with hunger. Everyone immediately sees Lindsay\'s throat is bleeding, revealing that Sarah is not the One, Lindsay is, and was all along. Corrine forces Sarah and Finn out of the house, and locks Lindsay in a room, and prepares her for the Initiation Ceremony. She calls Trina Goodwin, and tells her about Lindsay. Corrine mentions that it\'s ironic that Trina spent the last eighteen years bleeding the wrong daughter. Sarah never tried suicide, Trina was draining her blood through her wrists. Corrine decides that Trina Goodwin\'s services are no longer needed, and Corrine demands every drop of blood from Trina back, she kills Trina Goodwin with the Knife of Truth.  Sarah sends Finn to his dormitory, and she runs to P.E.D. and tells her the news. Everyone prepares for Initiation. While Sarah, in order to keep Finn safe from Alpha Nu, has sex with him to take away both of their virginity, ensuring the fact that the Eternal Flame will not take either of them. At Initiation, Sarah is initiated into P.E.D., and Lindsay is initiated into Alpha Nu Gamma. After the vows, Lindsay is taken to the basement, and  begs for freedom, and ends up being chained down upon the altar. At the same time, all of P.E.D. uses their magic to destroy the Alpha Nu house. Corrine sends all of the girls after them, and she will sacrifice Lindsay alone. Sarah runs in to free her sister, but Corrine almost ends up choking Sarah to death with the shackles used to hold Lindsay. Lindsay, finally free, picks up the Knife of Truth, cuts her hand, and stabs Corrine in the back, only to be stabbed in turn. With a handful of Lindsay\'s blood, Sarah pushes Corrine into the Eternal Flame, causing the Flame to uproar, destroying Corrine and the entire house. Back at P.E.D., Lindsay is healed by Dr. Hunter again, her inner strength proving Lindsay does have power after all. The movie ends with Dr. Hunter placing the Knife of Truth safely away forever; Sarah and all of P.E.D. walking out to find the rest of the Alpha Nus; and Esme walking off with a little bit of the Eternal Fire in a small cauldron.'] ['Holmes and Watson are in Canada attending a conference on the occult, when Lord Penrose receives a message that his wife Lady Penrose has been murdered in the small village of La Mort Rouge.Throughout the film, the actors pronounce correctly the name of the village as "La Mort Rouge" , but in one short moment a map is shown with the name spelled "La Morte Rouge"  which doesn\'t make much sense.

The "monster" is even later seen by Dr. Watson, who describes it as "a ball of fire spitting flames in each direction". Holmes, however, is skeptical, and recognizes Lady Penrose as Lillian Gentry, a former actress, who was involved in a famous murder case several years before when actor Alistair Ramson killed another actor in a jealous rage over her. Ramson was believed to have been killed in a prison escape two years before, but now Holmes believes that Ramson - a master of disguise - is living in the village, having created a new identity, perhaps several, for himself. Holmes then turns his attention to Judge Brisson, another inhabitant of the village with a connection to the case, as he passed sentence on Ramson. Despite Holmes\' warnings Brisson is murdered. Holmes tracks Ramson down to his hideout and discovers there is a third person that Ramson is preparing to kill. However before Holmes can discover who it is, Watson blunders in and Ramsom escapes.

But the mother is shocked to find that Ajay is possessed by the spirit of a woman, who turns out to be her daughter-in-law\'s spirit. It\'s revealed that the mother-in-law, her husband, and son had burned the newly-wedded bride to death and her spirit has come back for revenge. The spirit enters the police officer\'s body and shoots her mother-in-law. When the spirit leaves the officer\'s body, he realizes what has happened and secretly buries the body. Ajay is released and is driving back to the city when he sees the spirit in the backseat. She says that her father-in-law is away in the city on a business trip and she must complete her revenge. She assures him that she will not harm him--all he has to do is drop her off there.  After the stories are over, one boy claims that he is still not scared. The old lady smirks as the lights of the house suddenly turn off. The stunned boy looks around him. The lights turn back on immediately and he sees that he is the only one in the room: as if no one was ever there. The lights go off and turn back on again, this time to reveal his friends, all of whom are now dead, giving him eerie smiles. The old woman appears back on her chair, giving him a witch\'s smile. Realizing what is going on, the boy tries to make a frantic escape out of the house. But the doors are all jammed and locked. Just as the boy looks back at the upstairs room to see if he was followed out, he sees the old lady right beside him, smirking. The old lady\'s hair is snow-white and scattered; her killer smile gives the boy a heart attack and he dies at the scene. The next morning, the house is swarming with police and the media. The police clear away the bodies of the dead children. The old servant of the house tells the police officers that a long time ago, the house belonged to an old lady who loved children but unfortunately, she had no children of her own. He explains that once, he had left her for hours to get her some medication , and when he returned, he found her dead. The film ends with a reporter reading the tragic story of a camping trip-turned-nightmare for the six children. He says that the exact cause of death of the children is still unknown and will most likely never be known, however, one thing is for certain- all the children died of cardiac failure or in simple words — fear.'] ['In 1992, a group of young Anarchists seeking to preserve the local wildlife are brutally murdered.

Carol Anne awakens one night and begins conversing with the family\'s television set, which has started transmitting static following a sign-off. The following night, while the Freelings are sleeping, Carol Anne becomes fixated on the television set as it transmits static again. Suddenly, an apparition emerges from the television screen and vanishes into the wall, creating a violent earthquake within the house in the process, to which Carol Anne announces "They\'re here." Bizarre events begin to occur the following day, such as glasses and utensils that spontaneously break or bend and furniture that moves of its own accord. The phenomena seem benign at first, but quickly begin to intensify. That night, a gnarled backyard tree becomes animated and grabs Robbie through the bedroom window. While Diane and Steven rescue Robbie, Carol Anne is sucked through a portal in her closet. The Freelings realize she has been taken when they hear her voice emanating from a television set. A group of parapsychologists from UC Irvine—Dr. Lesh, Ryan, and Marty—come to the Freeling house to investigate and determine that the Freelings are experiencing a poltergeist intrusion. They discover that the disturbances involve more than just one ghost. Steven also finds out in an exchange with his boss, Lewis Teague, that Cuesta Verde is built where a cemetery was once located. After Dana and Robbie are sent away for their safety, Dr. Lesh and Ryan call in Tangina Barrons, a spiritual medium. Tangina states that the spirits inhabiting the house are lingering in a different "sphere of consciousness" and are not at rest. Attracted to Carol Anne\'s life force, these spirits are distracted from the real "light" that has come for them. Tangina then adds that among these ghosts, there is also a demon known as the "Beast", who has Carol Anne under restraint in an effort to manipulate the other spirits. The assembled group discovers that the entrance to the other dimension is through the children\'s bedroom closet, while the exit is through the living room ceiling. As the group attempts to rescue Carol Anne, Diane passes through the entrance tied by a rope that has been threaded through both portals. Diane manages to retrieve Carol Anne, and they both drop to the floor from the ceiling unconscious. As they recover, Tangina proclaims afterward that the house is now "clean". Shortly thereafter, the Freelings prepare to move elsewhere. During their last night in the house, Steven attends a meeting with Teague and Dana goes on a date, leaving Diane, Robbie, and Carol Anne alone in the house. The "Beast" then ambushes Diane and the children, attempting a second kidnapping. Diane and the children escape the house to discover coffins and rotting corpses erupting out from the ground throughout the neighborhood. As Steven and Dana return home to the mayhem, Steven realizes that rather than relocating the cemetery for the development of Cuesta Verde, Teague merely had the headstones moved and the bodies left behind, desecrating the burial grounds. The Freelings flee Cuesta Verde while the house itself implodes into another dimension, to the astonishment of onlookers. The family checks into a hotel for the night, and Steven shoves the room\'s television outside onto the balcony.'] ['In 1995, Samantha Darko  follows her best friend Corey  on a road trip from Virginia to California, in an attempt to become professional dancers.

In the center of its courtyard, there is a bomb which was defused. Carlos then sees a ghost of a boy in the kitchen doorway who disappears shortly after. When he goes in to investigate, he is distracted by two orphans, Galvez and Owl, whom he befriends. He shows them his toys and comics, until Jaime , an older orphan, steals one of them. Carlos starts to fight with him but is distracted by the sight of his tutor and his bodyguard driving away without him. Although he doesn't know it, his father is dead, and he will be staying in the orphanage indefinitely. Dr. Casares , the assistant administrator, sympathizes with him. That night, in his bed, Carlos is distracted by noises, suggested to be a ghost. The alleged ghost knocks over a pitcher of water, which wakes the rest of the orphans. Carlos and Jaime dare each other to go into the kitchen and refill the water pitchers. Carlos wanders down a spiral staircase, where he hears the ghost, who tells him cryptically that many will die. He runs away, but Jacinto ([[Eduardo Noriega , a former orphan who now works at the orphanage, catches him. The next day, Carlos does not reveal why he was out, which earns him Jaime's respect. However only when Carlos saves Jaime from drowning at the cost of having his face cut by Jacinto does Jaime's bullying of Carlos' cease. Jaime offers him a drawing and a piece of cake in return for the stolen comic book, but Carlos refuses. When a long sigh is heard, another orphan claims it is a ghost, and explains to Carlos that a boy named Santi  had disappeared on the same night the bomb was dropped. Since then, there has been a ghost haunting the orphanage. Jaime apparently does not believe in the ghost. One night, Carlos sneaks out to the courtyard. He approaches the bomb and asks it to show him where Santi is. In response, a paper streamer on the bomb is caught by the wind and leads him to the ghost, but Carlos becomes scared and runs away. The ghost follows him into the main building and corners Carlos at the end of a hallway. Frightened, Carlos locks himself in a closet, where he sleeps that night. Later when Carlos looks in Jaime's sketchbook and finds a picture of Santi bleeding, he realizes that Jaime knows more than he's telling. Jacinto has been in the orphanage for a long time and despises the place. His girlfriend Conchita , on whom Jaime has a crush, has plans to marry Jacinto. Jacinto, meanwhile, is aware of a stash of gold at the orphanage, and he uses sexual favors to steal keys from Carmen , the head of the orphanage, to open the safe. Carmen loves Dr. Casares, though she is unwilling to acknowledge this. Dr. Casares is embarrassed by his impotence and it seems to inhibit his confidence in demonstrating his affection for Carmen. Jacinto is unsuccessful in stealing the right key to the safe. On a trip to town, Dr. Casares witnesses Carlos' tutor and his bodyguard being executed by the army. Dr. Casares plans to lead the orphans away from the orphanage, because of the rapidly escalating war. Jacinto demands the gold but is forced to leave at gunpoint. As the orphans and staff prepare to leave, Conchita discovers Jacinto preparing to blow up the safe. She threatens him with a shotgun, he taunts her, and she accidentally shoots him in the shoulder. In the ensuing melee, Jacinto succeeds in burning much of the orphanage down before leaving. An explosion kills Carmen and many orphans, leaving many of the survivors badly wounded, including Dr. Casares who resolves to take up guard duty over the remains of the orphanage, waiting at the window with a shotgun for the return of Jacinto. The night after the explosion, Jaime tells Carlos that he was present when Santi was killed. They had been collecting slugs near the cistern, a man-made pool of water in the cellar under the kitchen. Santi heard a noise and discovered Jacinto trying to break into the safe. Santi ran back into the cellar and Jacinto followed. Jacinto tried to threaten Santi; when they struggled, Jacinto slammed him against a support column. Santi suffered a serious head wound and went into shock. Jacinto panicked and rushed off. In Jacinto's absence, Jaime came out of his hiding place and tried his best to comfort the mortally wounded Santi, the scene being revealed to the audience as the same one that was foreshadowed at the very beginning of the film.{{clarify}} Jaime then heard Jacinto returning, and ran off. Jacinto, unaware of Jaime's presence, tied weights to Santi's body and pushed him in the cistern, where he drowned. The second day after the explosion, Dr. Casares succumbs to his wounds, but before dying vows to the boys that he will not leave them. Meanwhile, Jacinto is en route back to the orphanage with two allies. While driving, he meets an exhausted Conchita, who has walked all night to get help in the town. Jacinto stops the vehicle and demands that Conchita apologize for shooting him. Conchita refuses, as she is no longer afraid of him. Jacinto stabs her in the stomach, killing her. Leaving her body on the side of the road, Jacinto and his friends make their way to the orphanage, where they imprison the surviving orphans and then look for the gold. Jacinto and his accomplices manage to open the damaged safe where Jacinto saw the gold hidden, but it is now empty. The conspirators angrily abandon Jacinto, take the car and leave him at the orphanage. In his despair Jacinto catches a glint of light in the rubble, and finds the gold hidden in Carmen's prosthetic leg, half-buried in debris. The orphans rationalize that they will be killed once Jacinto finds the gold. They sharpen sticks with shards of glass as makeshift weapons, and Galvez volunteers to climb out of a small, high window in order to open the locked door from the outside. Unfortunately, Galvez severely injures his ankle after he slips and falls from the window and is unable to move. Very much to the surprise of the other boys, the door suddenly unlocks and opens of its own accord. The boys quickly exit and come to the aid of Galvez, who tells them that it was Dr. Casares who opened the door and that the doctor told him that the boys must be brave and protect one another. The boys find Dr. Casares' monogrammed pocket square in the hallway, and move to confront Jacinto. The boys cleverly lure Jacinto into the cellar, and distract him while Jaime stabs him in the chest. The boys then push the wounded Jacinto into the same pool of water where he drowned Santi. Weighed down by the gold in his pockets and dragged down by the ghost of Santi, Jacinto drowns. The surviving children then leave the orphanage, watched over silently by the ghost of Dr. Casares."] ['Dorian Gray  is a handsome, wealthy young man living in 19th century London. While generally intelligent, he is naive and easily manipulated. These faults lead to his spiral into sin and, ultimately, misery. While posing for a painting by his friend Basil , Dorian meets Basil\'s friend Lord Henry Wotton . Wotton is cynical and witty, and tells Dorian that the only life worth living is one dedicated entirely to pleasure. After Wotton convinces Dorian that youth and beauty will bring him everything he desires, Dorian openly wishes that his portrait could age instead of him. He makes this statement in the presence of a certain Egyptian statue, which supposedly has the power to grant wishes. Dorian visits a tavern, where he falls in love with a beautiful singer named Sibyl Vane . He eventually enters a romance with her , and within weeks they are engaged. Though initially overjoyed, Dorian is again persuaded by Lord Henry to pursue a more hedonistic lifestyle. Dorian sends Sibyl a hurtful letter, breaking off their relationship, and "compensating" her with a large sum of money. The next morning, Lord Henry informs Dorian that a heartbroken Sibyl Vane had killed herself the night before. Dorian is at first shocked and guilt-ridden, but then adopts Lord Henry\'s indifferent manner. He surprises Basil by going to the opera immediately after hearing of Sibyl\'s death. Returning home that night, Dorian notices a change in the portrait Basil had painted, which now hangs in his living room. The portrait now looks harsher, and a shaken Dorian has it locked away in his old school room. He becomes even more dedicated to living a sinful and heartless life. Years later, Dorian is nearing his fortieth birthday, but he looks the same as he did when he was twenty two. The townspeople are awestruck at his unchanging appearance. Over eighteen years of pointless debauchery, the portrait remained locked away, with Dorian holding the only key. Dorian had grown more and more paranoid about the picture being seen by others, and would even fire the servants that he thought might suspect something. Over the years, the painting of the young Dorian had warped into that of a hideous, demon-like creature, to reflect Dorian\'s sins. Basil eventually catches a glimpse of the portrait and attempts to talk Dorian into reforming his life. However, Dorian panics and murders his friend, leaving the body locked in the school room with the painting. Dorian blackmails an old friend into disposing of Basil\'s body secretly. He then enters into a romance with Basil\'s niece, Gladys , who was a young child when the portrait was painted. Though Gladys had always loved Dorian , those who were once close to him begin to find him suspicious. Dorian begins to realize the harm his life is doing to himself and to others. He is assaulted by James Vane , Sibyl\'s brother, who had sworn revenge for his sister\'s death. Dorian calmly tells James that he is too young to be the same man from eighteen years before. However, James soon learns the truth, but is shot during a hunting party at Dorian\'s estate while hiding in the bushes. Dorian knows he is guilty for yet another death, and realizes that he can still spare Gladys from the misfortune he would certainly cause her. After leaving her a letter explaining himself, he returns to his old school room to face the painting. After stabbing his portrait in the heart to be free of its evil spell, Dorian collapses and dies. Dorian\'s body is found, but it is now the monstrous creature from the painting. The portrait once again depicts Dorian as a young, innocent man.'] ['The revelation of his own former humanity in Hellraiser II has resulted in the Cenobite named Pinhead being split into two distinct entities: His former self, World War I British Army Captain Eliot Spencer, and a manifestation of Spencer\'s id, which takes on the form of Pinhead.

Meanwhile, the remaining survivors  manage to catch a radio transmission revealing that there are other pockets of survivors holding out against the possessed, with one such refuge nearby. However, Michael advises them not to go, since they would be too vulnerable on the move. That night, a second wave of possessed attack, luring Kyle out by having a father and his son show up and having the father run over, motivating Kyle to attempt to save the child. The child turns out to be possessed, kills Kyle, and attacks Audrey but Michael intervenes and shoots down many possessed. The attack pushes a panicked Charlie into labor. Audrey and Michael help her deliver the baby as trumpets sound, signaling the approach of the Archangel Gabriel . In a panic, Sandra breaks her restraints and tries to give the baby to the possessed, but Michael guns her down. Moments later, Gabriel enters the diner seriously injuring Bob. Michael gives Jeep the keys to the police cruiser he arrived in, urging them to escape and telling Jeep, rather enigmatically to "find the prophets, learn to read the instructions". The hordes of possessed humans are unable to approach Charlie\'s baby, so Jeep, Audrey, Charlie, and the baby make their way to the cruiser. Gabriel and Michael fight, ending with Gabriel stabbing Michael through the chest with his mace. Michael dies and his body disappears. The dying Bob lights a flame to the diner\'s gas main, blowing up the diner, incinerating himself and the remaining possessed. Jeep\'s body gets covered in the same mysterious drawings seen on Michael\'s body which leads Jeep to realize that the tattoos are the instructions Michael spoke of. Gabriel then appears, having survived, and swoops down on the fleeing car. As he tries to reach Charlie, Audrey jumps on him and sacrifices herself by yelling at Jeep to slam on the brakes, sending Gabriel through the front windshield as the car crashes. Charlie and Jeep survive with the baby, but Audrey doesn\'t survive the crash. Gabriel finally corners the three in the nearby mountains. He is about to kill them when Michael appears from Heaven, an angel once more, and stops Gabriel. Michael tells Gabriel that he  did what God needed, not what God wanted, thus giving humanity another chance. With his angelic powers back, Michael easily defeats Gabriel, but spares his life after which Gabriel leaves, defeated. Michael explains to Jeep that he is the child\'s true protector and to have faith when Jeep asks if they will see Michael again, then flies off. Charlie and Jeep make it to the top of the mountain and see a small town in the valley below. Sometime later, Charlie, Jeep and the baby are seen driving off into the distance with a station wagon full of weapons, after which the credits roll.'] ['Clinical psychologist Dr. Chris Kelvin is approached by emissaries for DBA, a corporation operating a space station orbiting the planet Solaris, who relay a message sent from his scientist friend Dr. Gibarian. Gibarian requests Chris come to the station to help understand an unusual phenomenon, but is unwilling to explain the exact nature. DBA is unsure how to proceed, as the mission to study Solaris has been sidetracked and none of the astronauts want to return home. In addition, DBA has lost contact with the security patrol recently dispatched to the station. Chris agrees to a solo mission to go to Solaris as a last attempt to recover the crew. Upon arriving at the space station, Chris learns that Gibarian has committed suicide and most of the crew have either died or disappeared under bizarre circumstances. Both surviving crew members, Snow and Dr. Gordon, are reluctant to explain the situation at hand. Alone in his crew quarters, Chris dreams about his dead wife Rheya —reliving when they first met and some of their most romantic and intimate moments. He awakens shocked and terrified to encounter Rheya alive again beside him in bed and leads her into an escape pod and jettisons it into space. Chris confides his actions to Snow and comes to understand that replicas of the crew\'s loved ones have been mysteriously appearing. When Rheya manifests a second time Chris lets her stay, but she admits she doesn\'t feel human; her memories feel artificial, in that she lacks the emotional attachment that comes with actually having lived them. Chris, Rheya, Snow and Gordon meet to discuss the situation and Gordon informs Rheya what Chris did to her previous replica. Rheya leaves the meeting horrified and Chris confronts Gordon, who in turn chastises him for getting emotionally involved with something that isn\'t real and may pose a threat to human beings. Later, during a dream, Chris questions a replica of Gibarian as to what Solaris\' motives are for providing the manifestations, but is told "there are no answers, only choices." Chris wakes to find Rheya dead, having committed suicide by drinking liquid oxygen and, in front of Gordon and Snow, Chris wills her back to a restored state. Gordon reveals that she has an apparatus which can permanently destroy a replica but Chris objects to using it on Rheya. He begins ingesting a chemical stimulant to stay awake in order to monitor Rheya. Chris eventually falls asleep and Rheya approaches Gordon who destroys her with the apparatus as she has done for all replicas who have requested her to do so. Chris confronts Gordon who maintains she merely facilitated in assisted suicide and in her xenophobia she only wants the preservation of the humans. Chris and Gordon then discover the body of Snow stashed away in a ceiling vent and realize that the Snow they have been interacting with is a replica. Snow admits to being a replica and explains that upon being dreamed into existence, he was attacked by his creator and thus killed the \'original Snow\' in self-defense. The Snow replica tells them that repeat usage of the apparatus has drained the ship\'s fuel cell reactor, making a return trip to Earth impossible. Furthermore, Solaris has reacted to the behavior of the humans by increasing its mass, thereby gravitationally pulling the space station toward the planet. Gordon and Chris begin prepping a smaller space vehicle called Athena to escape. Chris is shown pondering his experiences from the space station back on Earth, discontentedly concluding that the reason Rheya\'s replica wanted to die was because he "remembered her wrong"&mdash;as suicidal. One day he cuts his finger while chopping vegetables in his kitchen, but the wound immediately regenerates, just as Rheya\'s replica once did. Then Rheya appears, declaring that they transcend life and death and that all they\'ve done to each other is forgiven. This suggests that Chris isn\'t really on Earth, or that what\'s on Earth isn\'t really Chris. Chris never actually leaves the space station with Gordon: he sends her off alone and stays behind to plummet into Solaris.'] ['In a small town in the Deep South, "Bubba" Ritter , a large but gentle mentally challenged man, befriends young Marylee Williams, . Some of the townspeople are upset by the friendship between Marylee and Bubba, and the brooding, mean-spirited postman Otis Hazelrigg  is the worst. When Marylee is almost killed by a vicious dog  and lies unconscious at a doctor\'s office, Otis promptly assumes that Bubba has murdered  her. Otis and three friends - gas station attendant Skeeter Norris and farmer-cousins Philby and Harliss Hocker - form a lynch mob. They chase Bubba to his mother \'s house. She believes her son and they play "the Hiding Game": disguising Bubba as a scarecrow and posting him in a nearby field to wait for the drama to cool down. Otis\' bloodhounds sniff Bubba out, however, and all four vigilantes empty multiple rounds from their guns into him, killing him. Afterwards, they discover that Marylee is in fact alive, thanks to Bubba, whom they have just murdered. Acting fast, Otis places a pitchfork in Bubba\'s lifeless hands to make it appear as if he were attacking them with a weapon. In court, Otis and his fellow vigilantes swear they acted in self-defense. Bubba\'s mother denounces her son\'s killers before the courtroom, stating, "You may think that you\'re getting off free, but there\'s other justice in this world, besides the law!" only to be ejected by the bailiff. Sam Willock, the local district attorney, does not believe the vigilantes\' self-defense story, but he cannot make the murder case stick due to a lack of witnesses. The vigilantes go free, but Sam calls after them: "Hazelrigg, just a minute. I want to tell you "men" one thing. I think you executed that man. And I promise you this; If I ever find a single shred of evidence, I\'ll see every one of you on Death row!" A day later, Harliss finds a scarecrow in his fields like the one Bubba was hidden in. Neither Harliss nor his wife can figure out how it got there as neither of them placed it. That evening, the scarecrow has disappeared. As he begins his walk up the steps to his front door, the wood chipper begins to run, and a light comes on in the barn. At first, Harliss believes Sam has invited himself over, walks to the barn, and shuts off the chipper. As he investigates, he climbs up the hayloft to confront what he now believes is the district attorney snooping around his barn. Walking on the support beam, he is startled as the wood chipper is mysteriously reactivated. Losing his balance, he grabs the cord of the light that is hanging in the barn. Screaming, he calls for his wife. No longer able to hang on as the sparks from the light shower him, he loses his grip on the light and dies after falling into the chipper. The next morning, Skeeter and Philby inform Otis of Harliss\'s mysterious death. The trio investigate, and find the thresher is no longer operational. Otis figures it must have run out of gas, but when its tank proves to be nearly full, he jumps to another conclusion. The next morning, he visits Mrs. Ritter and accuses her of killing his friend, although he cannot prove anything. She denies the charges, but says that all four of the men will get their just deserts promptly enough . When Philby discovers a scarecrow like the one Bubba was dressed as in his field, Otis acts fast. He breaks into Mrs. Ritter\'s house as she sits before her lit fireplace and grabs her from behind, demanding that she explain what\'s going on with the scarecrows. But she cannot tell him anything because she has suffered a heart attack as he tries to muffle her screams. To cover his tracks, Otis turns Mrs. Ritter\'s gas stove on full, then walks out. As the gas reaches the fireplace the house explodes, again leaving nothing for Sam to use against Otis. That night at his farm, Philby notices that the "Bubba" scarecrow  in his field has gotten off its field-post, and is walking toward him. Panicking, Philby locks himself in a grain silo. The scarecrow jams the silo door, trapping Philby inside, and then turns on the conveyor belt feeding into the silo. Philby is buried in grain and perishes. The next day, Skeeter is ready to turn himself in rather than face the scarecrow\'s wrath. Yet Otis remains convinced that it\'s all a hoax by somebody seeking to avenge the Ritter murders. To verify said theory, Otis and Skeeter break into the local cemetery that night. They dig up Bubba\'s coffin and open it. Bubba is inside . Otis has to wrestle Skeeter to stop him from fleeing in terror. They agree to fill the grave back in. But as Skeeter is nailing the coffin shut again, Otis kills him from behind by striking his head with a shovel. Otis re-buries both corpses and then drives off, back towards town. En route home, Otis finds Marylee alone at roadside, and chases her into a pumpkin patch. He grabs Marylee and accuses her of masterminding the scarecrow murders. Suddenly, a combination payloader/plowing machine starts up nearby and chases Otis through the pumpkin patch, snapping its shovel and turning pumpkins to pulp.  As he flees, Otis accidentally runs into the Bubba-Scarecrow, still holding the pitchfork, on which Otis has just impaled himself. Otis sinks to his knees and points at the Scarecrow, who nods, before keeling over dead. The scarecrow walks off through the pumpkin patch and finds Marylee, to whom he hands a flower. She says: "Thank you, Bubba. You know what? Tomorrow, I think I\'ll teach you a new game. Did I ever show you how to play the Chasing Game? It\'s fun. You\'ll love it. It\'s sort of like playing tag..." Note: "With its 1981 release “Dark Night of the Scarecrow” was the first feature length horror film with a scarecrow as its centerpiece. In the intervening years many have copied this image, but with “Dark Night of the Scarecrow” writer J.D. Feigelson is credited as creator of the entire “Killer Scarecrow” horror film sub-genre."

Story is here to find a specific writer whose book will better humanity\'s future. After questioning residents Farber , Bell , Dury ([[Jeffrey Wright , and five nameless smokers, Heep discovers the author, Vick Ran , who is writing The Cookbook, containing views and ideas so significant they will inspire a future President, a great Midwestern orator, to greatly change the world for the better. Ran meeting Story eliminates his fear and sharpens his inner voice, but he learns he will be assassinated due to the controversial nature of his ideas. The Tartutic, an invincible simian trio that serve as the Blue World\'s peacekeepers, have forbidden that Story be attacked while returning home. The Scrunt nonetheless does just that, as Story is destined to be a great leader as well. To return safely, she will now need the help of a Symbolist, Guardian, Guild, and Healer. Story believes Heep to be her Guardian; Heep asks Farber, a West Coast émigré turned film critic, to help him figure out the others\' identities. Working off movie tropes, Farber misadvises Heep, leading him to a flawed conclusion that a logophile named Dury is the Symbolist, a group of misfit "tokers" are the Guild, and a woman who cares for stray animals named Bell is the Healer. Heep asks Story how to "practice" for the confrontation but nearly dies in the process, convincing him he\'s not the Guardian. The next night, Farber\'s bad advice leads to their plan\'s immediate failure. In the confusion, Farber is killed and Story is mortally wounded by the Scrunt. Dury suddenly realizes his son Joey  is the Symbolist. Interpreting the information on cereal boxes, Joey deduces the true Guild is composed of seven sisters, that two new men must be present, and that the Healer is male, soon revealed to be Heep. He goes about healing Story by "bringing forth [his] energy" . Story\'s departure starts again, but the Scrunt attacks; it is stopped by the gaze of Reggie ([[Freddy Rodriguez , a lopsidedly muscled tenant who is the true Guardian. Reggie\'s gaze, capable of compelling the Scrunt to slowly retreat, is distracted by the cry of the Great Eatlon, a giant eagle who will ferry Story home. When Reggie breaks eye contact, the Scrunt leaps, but is seized by the Tarturic and dragged away. Heep thanks Story for saving his life as she hugs him goodbye. The Great Eatlon lands, enfolds Story in one of its wings, and takes flight. Each tenant watches as she is ferried into the storm.'] ["The film is a modern-day version of the Rasputin story; the major characters have the same first names as Rasputin and the Romanov royal family, and their family name 'Rast' is simply 'Tsar' backwards. Hemmings plays an up-and-coming senator, Nick Rast, whose young son is terminally ill with leukaemia. A mysterious faith healer, Gregory Wolfe , appears and seems to cure the boy. Rast's wife Sandy  falls in love with Wolfe, but the powerful interests behind Rast's career, represented by geriatric monster Doc Wheelan  are less happy with events."] ["Jack Bishop  works as a loan officer in Del Rio, Texas and is remarried to Amaya Bishop , living with her and his daughter Toby Bishop  from his first marriage. Toby is kidnapped by an unknown perpetrator leading to the involvement of the local police and eventually the FBI. The FBI begins inquiring in Jack's past only to find out he has no official records dating back farther than ten years, and there is no evidence showing how his first wife had died or where she was buried. A local petty criminal and repeated sex offender is initially thought to be the culprit, but it is revealed that the dangerous cult-like religious movement Santa Muerte, popular within Mexican criminal circles, might be involved. Jack's former life as a Santa Muerte worshiping hit man for the Mexican mafia is revealed as he tries desperately to find out who kidnapped his daughter. We later learn that Jack was really named Roberto. Though born in Oklahoma, his drug addicted mother took him to Mexico when she was young. She later died, and Roberto had to make a life for himself on the streets. He ultimately became an enforcer for the Mexican mafia. He married a woman named Katie, and they had a child, Toby. Jack escapes from the FBI in Texas and makes his way across the border to Acuna. There he is accused of murdering a prostitute who was trying to help him find Toby. Though he did not do it, the Mexican police arrest him. Jack is later able to escape from the Mexican jail in disguise. Still in Acuna, he makes his presence known. As he planned, he lured the assassin who was looking for him to come to his hotel. They fight and Jack beats the assassin, who he then tortures for information about Toby's whereabouts. The assassin tells Jack that Toby was kidnapped by Katie, Jack's/Roberto's ex-wife. Jack breaks into the brothel that Katie now runs in Acuna and confronts Katie, who is herself furious that Jack/Roberto ran out on her without warning and took Toby with him. Jack thinks Katie is lying when she says she does not know where Toby is, and murders her. In the film's denouement, we realize that the real kidnapper was Jack's new wife, Amaya, with the help of her cousin, the Sheriff in Del Rio . We learn that the flashback we have seen throughout the film—of Jack/Roberto strangling a man at Katie's behest as she looks on in delight—has new meaning. The man Roberto strangled was Amaya's father. Worse still, Amaya was in the room with Roberto and Katie when they strangled her father, hiding under the bed. Amaya's father was a degenerate gambler who owed a large debt to Katie and the Mexican Mob, and when he could not pay, Katie had Roberto kill him. Amaya witnessed all of this. We realize that she then set in motion an elaborate plan to emigrate to the United States and marry Jack/Roberto in order to punish him for murdering her father. It was Amaya and the Sheriff who kidnapped Toby. Amaya and the Sheriff set fire to the room where Jack is . But Jack is able to see that Toby is tied up on the bed in the room. He manages to free her and they escape the fire unhurt. The viewer thinks this is the end of the movie and that it has a happy ending. But we then learn, in a final twist, the truth. Amaya did not really kidnap Toby. When Amaya explained to Toby who her father really was, Amaya was able to enlist Toby  to help exact an even worse revenge on Jack/Roberto. Amaya tells Toby that her father will kill her mother . Amaya told Toby that Santa Muerte magic would give her the strength to carry out a terrible revenge on her father for that murder. So Amaya purposefully let Jack and Toby escape. Her plan was for them to live happily for many years and then for Toby to kill her father. In the final scene, we see Jack and Toby fleeing deeper into Mexico on an old bus. As she sits and watches the countryside go by, we hear Toby reciting the same Santa Muerta chant for power that others  said throughout the movie."] ["In this movie we learn that Druids have stopped the rise of Satan's son using magical rune stones, which create light to vanquish the darkness. The opening shows one of these rituals taking place on a woman Satan has selected; it does not take long before they are attacked by Christians who feel their work is synonymous with Satanic witchcraft . Most of the Druids die, and the rune stones are scattered. The movie cuts to a more recognizable future where a young man and woman are clearly in love with each other but are having issues. Their parents are druids, while the girl's father is a priest and has neglected his responsibilities as a druid, the boy's father kills his son so he can rise again with the aid of druid magic to become a druid warrior. In the meantime, a young woman has possession of one of the runes due to it being passed down through her family. She wears the rune to impress her date, but, as she looks out her kitchen window at the lunar eclipse, she instantly becomes pregnant and gives birth to the Warlock, allowing Satan to conceive a son in the form of Julian Sands. After he is reborn, he chases down the poor girl who unwillingly gave birth to him and kills her. He then peels the flesh from her stomach and makes it into a map, so he can track the other runes. So the druid warrior now learns how to use his druid powers, and it is not long before his girlfriend joins him. While all this goes on, the warlock gains the rune stones to raise his father from his prison, causing all sorts of chaos and deaths along the way. The last rune stone is around the neck of the Druid warrior, and they both fight the warlock exhibiting a vast array of powers and magic. At the end, as Satan rises, they shine car lights, sending him back, and they kill the warlock with a powerful knife tempered with metal from the holy grail. The warlock dies a gruesome death, taking a rune stone with him, and the Druid warriors leave."] ["Ivan Mozer , a serial killer who has been convicted of the rape, torture and murder of 23 people; although, at his execution, he boasts of having killed 24.

He takes the Marquis' severed head and sets about boiling it to remove its flesh, leaving the skull; before the task is done, Pierre himself has met an unseen and horrific death. The story then moves to the modern day. Christopher Maitland , a collector and writer on the occult, is offered the skull by Marco , an unscrupulous dealer in antiques and curiosities.

He warns Maitland of its powers. At his sleazy lodgings Marco dies in mysterious circumstances; Maitland finds his body and takes possession of the skull. He in turns falls victim as the skull drives him to hallucinations, madness and death."] ["{{Plot}} The film opens with an animated prologue revealing the origins of leprechauns, stating that they were summoned by a king to protect his gold. After the death of the king the Leprechauns returned to their places of origin, all except one  who remained in the mortal world and through the ages slowly became corrupted and obsessed with the treasure he still guarded. In the present, Father Jacob  is chased through the construction site of the youth center he had planned on building by the Leprechaun, whose gold Jacob had taken to fund the building project. Using four-leaf clover laced holy water Jacob manages to banish the Leprechaun, summoning demonic hands which drag him underground, but soon after drops dead of injuries inflicted by the Leprechaun during the fight. One year later, two friends, Emily Woodrow  and Lisa Duncan , have their fortune told when the clairvoyant Esmeralda  who warns them that they will attain great wealth soon, but it must be denied as it will come at a great price and summon a terrible evil. While having a barbecue at the abandoned youth center construction site with Lisa, their stoner friend Jamie Davis  and her ex-boyfriend-turned-drug dealer Rory Jackson , Emily falls through a hole and discovers the Leprechaun's gold in an old tunnel where it was hidden by Father Jacob. Evenly splitting up the gold, the quartet of friends use it to fulfill their fantasies, unaware that by taking the gold they have released the Leprechaun, who begins stalking the group . At the salon where Emily works the Leprechaun sneaks in and, after killing a regular customer, Doria, on the massage table by breaking her neck, attacks Emily, who barely escapes and warns Rory and the recently released Jamie, who rush to get to Lisa's. In her house, Lisa is attacked by the Leprechaun and manages to fight him off for a short while, but is killed when the Leprechaun claws her in the stomach, with her friends finding her body moments later. While Emily and Jamie want to return the gold, Rory does not and takes off with it; shortly after realizing Rory is gone, Emily is attacked and chased outside by the Leprechaun, but is saved when Rory has a change of heart and comes back for her. Searching for Rory the Leprechaun stops by his house and kills Rory's profligate girlfriend Chanel  by tearing out her upper jaw, reclaiming the gold she used to make a tooth while Rory and Emily are stopped and harassed by Officers Thompson  and Whitaker . After the Leprechaun appears and kills the two officers, Emily and Rory escape and regroup with Jamie, only to be confronted by a machine gun wielding group of Rory's drug-dealing rivals, led by Watson  and Cedric . Planning on executing Rory for infringing on their territory, Watson and his gang are all disposed of by the Leprechaun, while Emily, Rory and Jamie drive off in Watson's car  and go looking for help from Esmeralda. Advised to use four-leaf clovers against the Leprechaun by Esmeralda, Rory laces the hollow-point bullets of his gun with clovers Jamie finds in the marijuana Rory had earlier sold him. When the Leprechaun arrives, Rory shoots him several times with the clover bullets, only for his gun to jam before he can finish the Leprechaun off. Rory and Emily are given the chance to run with the gold when the Leprechaun is distracted by Jamie, who is quickly wounded with a baseball bat to the leg, and Esmeralda dies in a magical duel with the Leprechaun. Followed to the roof of the building, Rory tries fighting the Leprechaun and is knocked out, though before the Leprechaun can kill him, Emily taunts him by throwing some of his gold into nearby wet cement and lures him into the ruins of the youth center, where she tosses his gold into a furnace before knocking the Leprechaun in with it. Believing the Leprechaun is dead, Emily returns to Rory, only for the recovered Leprechaun to renew his attack on them. Knocking Emily off the roof and leaving her barely holding on, the Leprechaun taunts her, but is shot several times in the middle of his speech by Rory, who had fixed his gun. Shooting the Leprechaun repeatedly, Rory runs out of bullets, but distracts him long enough for Emily to hit the Leprechaun with the chest of coins, sending him plummeting off the rooftop and into the wet cement below, where the Leprechaun sinks and becomes trapped with his gold. The movie then cuts back to the animated prologue like the one at the beginning, and the Leprechaun digs himself out of the ground, leaving a cliffhanger ending."] ['During the opening credits, Bergman can be overheard giving instructions to and discussing with his staff while preparing a shot. The film is framed through the account of Alma , who addresses the audience directly while sitting at a picnic table. She tells of her husband\'s disappearance, which is explored in a flashback constructed of his diaries and her words. Johan Borg  is a painter who is regularly approached by odd and suspicious people. He confides to his young, pregnant wife Alma  that he believes them to be demons, and that his insomnia is growing worse. On the nights when Johan can\'t sleep, Alma stays awake by his side through the nights, especially during the "vargtimmen" , during which, Johan says, most births and deaths occur. Johan begins to give names to the figures who approach him, including the Bird-Man, the Insects, the Meat-Eaters, the Schoolmaster , and The Lady With a Hat. In one scene, he recounts to his wife meeting a small boy tanning himself on a rock. As the boy approached Johan, he violently smashed the child\'s face against a stone before tossing him into the ocean to drown. Alma reacts to the story with shock. The couple are approached by a baron von Merkens , who lives in a nearby castle. The painter and his wife visit them and their surreal household. In a later encounter with only Johan in attendance, Johan\'s ex-girlfriend Veronica lies waiting on a table. A man dresses Johan in make-up and women\'s clothing in preparation for a sexual encounter with her only for the baron\'s guests to laugh and mock him as they meet. Johan panics, and flees into underbrush. In the last act of the film, Alma searches the forest for her husband, only to find his mangled body. In the final moments, she addresses the camera, "Is it true that a woman who lives a long time with a man eventually winds up being like that man? I mean, she loves him, and tries to think like him, and see like him? They say it can change a person. I mean to say, if I had loved him much less, and not bothered so of everything about him, could I have protected him better?"'] ['{{plot}} In the Mojave Desert in 1982, a man named Nix  has gathered a cult in an isolated house. Nix calls himself "The Puritan" and has the ability to use real magic. He plans to sacrifice a young girl that he has kidnapped. While preaching to his followers, a group of former cult members–Swann, Pimm , Quaid  and Jennifer Desiderio –arrive to stop Nix. After the initial confrontation with the cultists, Nix\'s assistant Butterfield escapes and Swann is attacked by Nix. Nix uses his powers, inducing in Swann the vision of “Flesh with a God\'s Eyes", causing him see his friends as monstrous figures. The kidnapped girl shoots Nix through the heart with Swann\'s gun. Quaid and Jennifer shoot him until he falls. Swann snaps out of his vision and fastens an ironwork mask over Nix\'s head. Nix thrashes violently for a few moments and appears to die. Swann declares that they will bury him so deep that no one will ever find him. Thirteen years later, New York City private detective Harry D\'Amour  is investigating an insurance fraud case in Los Angeles. D\'Amour has a long-standing interest in the occult, and has some renown from his involvement with a recent exorcism. During the investigation, D\'Amour discovers a fortune teller shop owned by Quaid, where he is relentlessly attacked by a bald man with unusual strength. After finally killing his attacker, D\'Amour finds Quaid suffering from multiple stab wounds. As he dies, Quaid warns D\'Amour that “The Puritan” is coming. Harry reports the incident to the police, but they can\'t find the bald man\'s body. Swann, now a famous stage illusionist, lives in a Beverly Hills mansion with his wife, Dorothea . Swann informs Dorothea that Nix\'s followers have murdered Quaid. Dorothea suggests they hire D\'Amour to investigate the murder. Swann\'s assistant, Valentin , collects D\'Amour, informing D\'Amour that Swann is a performer, not a "real" magician. They attend Quaid\'s funeral, where D\'Amour is introduced to Dorothea. D\'Amour agrees to work for her and she invites him to Swann\'s magic show. Butterfield and the bald man are in the audience. Swann performs a new death-defying illusion, but it goes wrong and he is killed on stage. D\'Amour investigates the accident backstage, and is attacked by Butterfield and the bald man. D\'Amour impales the bald man on a prop. Harry goes to The Magic Castle, where he meets Billy Inferno, another illusionist. Inferno has heard of Nix described as a legend, but he believes that Nix taught Swann to use real magic. D\'Amour questions Dorothea, but she denies ever having heard the name "Nix". Harry learns that Jennifer Desiderio is now institutionalized. D\'Amour visits her and sees that she is irrevocably insane. When he mentions Swann, she becomes violently agitated and screams warnings about Nix and "The Puritan". She flees into the street where she is hit and killed by a car. D\'Amour enlists Inferno\'s help to get into The Repository, a special room in the Castle that supposedly contains every magic secret known to man. After perusing the books there, D\'Amour learns more about Nix and confirms that Swann\'s "illusions" involved real magic. D\'Amour questions Dorothea again. She reveals that she was the girl that Nix kidnapped, and that she married Swann because she felt she owed her life to him. Dorothea and D\'Amour make love. Afterwards he is attacked by a man engulfed in fire. Harry suspects that the attack was Swann\'s attempt at revenge, so he opens his coffin and finds that the body inside is fake. Valentin explains that he helped Swann fake his death. D\'Amour agrees to allow Valentin and Dorothea\'s ruse to continue. Harry spots Swann in disguise at his own funeral and follows him. Swann, who knows about their tryst, attacks Harry again with magic. D\'Amour convinces Swann to help him put an end to Nix\'s cult. Butterfield attacks Valentin and kidnaps Dorothea. Butterfield uses Dorothea as a hostage to force Valentin to recover Nix\'s body. Butterfield takes the corpse back to the old house in the desert. There, the other cultists have already gathered to bring about Nix\'s resurrection. Butterfield removes the iron mask and Nix regains consciousness. Swann and D\'Amour, acting on information given by the dying Valentin, arrive. Butterfield attacks D\'Amour. Swann attacks Butterfield and tells D\'Amour to rescue Dorothea.

Kitura tells her she must do the inventory like Tejima promised before they allow them to stock Cosmo Mart products. Nao Niigaki, the young woman who works the morning part-time shift, becomes friends with Ryouko. Ryouko goes to do the inventory and a customer in a hooded winter coat comes in and starts reading a magazine. Nao tries to get a good look at his face but can only see darkness. Later, a man comes in and buys a product for 666 yen. While walking home, that man encounters a white ball which has rolled from a dark alley. He picks up the ball and walks into the alley where a voice asks him to return the ball. He walks into the darkness, disappears, and the ball is bounced outside again. While Nao sorts the drinks in the freezer, she sees a pair of eyes staring back at her. Ryouko, while doing inventory, finds a product that expired three years ago. She questions the Kituras, who blankly continue staring in the video camera of the store. Two crows crash into the window, killing themselves. Nao and Ryouko go to outside to investigate, where the Kituras are somehow already present with a hose. They hose away the crow remains, laughing madly. The night-shift part-timer, Komori, takes Nao\'s position. That night, a man and woman buy products for 699 yen and 999 yen respectively. On the way home, the woman is stalked by a man with a sledgehammer, who eventually appears inside her apartment and attacks her. The next day, Ryouko receives a call from Tejima, who tells her "everyone has feet" before the signal becomes static.

Nao examines the baby carriage the woman is pushing to find a china doll in there. Nao leaves with the woman, looking back to find Komori staring blankly into space like the Kituras. Nao and the woman talk at the park. Ryouko, passing by, joins them. The woman reveals that the man who owned the store was a very evil man who abused everyone. While building the store, the owner abused his contractor in many ways with money. The contractor, in anger, broke all the tombstones of people without families and used the fragments to build the foundation. This explains why the store is haunted. Ryouko tells Nao to stop working there. Nao plans to save Komori before he becomes insane like the Kituras. Nao comes to the store to find Komori in the bathroom hypnotized by the eyes of a ghost. The ghost draws Komori toward it until Nao saves him. Komori, regaining his mind, runs out of the store where, in the sun, he baptizes himself in the river.

Soon after, he is demoted from editor in chief of a publishing house during a takeover by ruthless tycoon Raymond Alden , who replaces him with Will\'s ambitious protégé Stewart Swinton . Will begins experiencing physiological changes, ranging from increased appetites and libido to hair regrowth and sharper-than-human sensory perceptions. Catching an unfamiliar scent on his wife Charlotte\'s clothing, Will rushes over to Stewart\'s house, bites Stewart during a brief physical altercation, and rushes upstairs to the bedroom, where he finds evidence of Charlotte\'s infidelity. Will leaves his wife, takes up residence at the Mayflower Hotel, and, as the moon ripens, takes on increasingly bestial aggressive characteristics. With the help of Alden\'s rebellious daughter Laura , Will tries to adapt to his new existence. His first nocturnal escapade as a werewolf takes place at Laura\'s guesthouse on the Alder estate, where he partially transforms and hunts down a deer by moonlight. In the morning, Will finds himself on the bank of a stream, with blood all over his face and hands, and, fearing notice, hurriedly departs in his Volvo. He visits paranormal scholar Vijav Alezais , who gives him a silver amulet believed to be proof against lycanthropy. Alezais, who has recently been diagnosed with a terminal illness, asks Will to bite him, preferring "damnation" to death. Will refuses, but keeps the amulet, in the hopes that it will cure or forestall his condition. Returning to his hotel, Will calls Laura to explain his nocturnal disappearance, and asks to see her again. Later that evening, Will, again a wolfman, breaks into the Zoo, escaping two policemen and taking their handcuffs. Muggers attempt to steal his valuables, but he springs upon his assailants, wounding them savagely. He wakes up in his hotel, with no memory of the night\'s events. Threatening to lead a mass writers\' exodus, Will successfully wrests his editor-in-chief position back from Alden, and negotiates for additional supervisory powers. Will surprises Stewart in the bathroom, notifies him of these office developments, fires him, and then urinates on Stewart\'s suede shoes so as to "mark his territory." While washing his hands, Will finds two of the muggers\' severed fingers in his jacket pocket, and realizes the beast is gaining control. Horrified by this realization, Will returns to his hotel, where Charlotte stops him in the lobby to beg his forgiveness. Will rebukes his now-estranged wife and tells her to stay away. Laura surrepitiously witnesses this argument, and makes her way upstairs to Will\'s room, where the two begin a sexual relationship. Detective Bridger  visits Will\'s hotel room the next day to inform him of Charlotte\'s savage murder. Separately, Will and Laura both begin to harbor doubts concerning Will\'s possible involvement in the crime. Cutaway scenes between Stewart, Alder, and the police gradually inform the viewer that Randall\'s former protégé is now trying to frame Will in an attempt to get his job back. Disquieted by Will\'s superhuman hearing, dried mud on his shoes, and a phone call from Detective Bridger revealing that Charlotte\'s blood and tissue samples were contaminated by canine DNA, Laura comes to believe that Will is a murderous monster. Will voluntarily submits to being locked in the Alder horse-barn while Laura goes to the police station. There, she encounters an uncharacteristically feral Stewart, whose amber eyes and increasingly-bestial manner suggest that, having previously been bitten by Will, he has also begun the werewolf transformation. Laura fends off Stewart\'s sexual advances and hurries back to the Alder estate, now convinced of Will\'s innocence and intent on leaving the country with him. Stewart follows Laura back to her father\'s estate, where he surprises and kills two security guards. A brief struggle in the barn ensues. Stewart tries to rape Laura, but Will intervenes, tearing off Alezais\' amulet, escaping his stable cell, and giving into the full-moon transformation. Both werewolves are brutally injured in the fight. Will eventually gains the upper hand over his opponent; Stewart tries to backstab him with a set of hedge-clippers, but Laura picks up a dead guard\'s revolver and shoots him dead. Will, now quite lupine, shares a wordless moment with Laura before running into the forest. Later that same evening, Laura is debriefed by police on the scene, and feigns horrified surprise. Alder reconciles with his daughter; Detective Bridger opines that Will was "too tame" to make a good match for Laura, and is unnerved when Laura invites him in for a vodka tonic, noting that he has already had one this evening, and that she "can smell it a mile away." The final scene is a close-up of Laura\'s face, now amber-eyed, transitioning into Will howling at the moon as he completes his final metamorphosis, then back to Laura, fading out to her glowing, no-longer-human gaze.'] ['For several generations the Parks family lived on a quiet hillside where Katelyn\'s grandfather and her father  were keepers to the town\'s lighthouse.

Neff , takes the boy under his wing and warns him not to draw any attention to himself until the right moment. He also points him to Revelation, chapter 13, in which Damien reads about the beast.

One of the burglars steals the gem and is forced to abandon her partner during the escape. The Djinn escapes and kills the remaining burglar when he accidentally wishes he\'d never been born. As the police enter the museum, the demon finishes forming into full size, revealing the Djinn . The Djinn surrenders to the police and is led away. That evening, Morgana is shown sleeping very restlessly, her left arm dangling over the edge of the bed. In the meantime, Demarest is in a holding cell waiting to be transferred to prison, where he kills a fellow prisoner. In her dreams she sees glimpses of the Djinn in his true form. The next day, Morgana goes to Church to visit the priest tending the church, a man named Gregory -- a former lover of Morgana\'s before he found God and joined the priesthood. In prison, Demarest continues to kill prisoners and other personnel through purposely miscontrued wishes, and is confronted by Butz  and his two henchmen, the Tiger brothers . Butz runs all \'underground business\' at the prison and gives Demarest a \'friendly\' warning that he is going to be watching him. Morgana is up at dawn, screaming out to her unseen tormentor, demanding to know who he is. She goes to her computer and does an internet search on Persian Mythology. A voiceover from Morgana recites the contents of a web site she is reading on the Persian deity Ahura Mazda. He was known as a deity of both light and dark, symbolizing the duality of good and evil. He was also known as the keeper of the Stone of the Sacred Fire. Gregory arrives at her loft, he says that Father Dimitri from the church noted that she had passed by, and she seemed unwell. Morgana opens up just a little, telling Gregory she hasn\'t been sleeping well, and experiencing confusing nightmares about a voice telling her to \'fulfill the prophecy\' and confesses to the robbery and the murder of the guard. Morgana goes to the prison to visit Demarest. She demands to know why he confessed to the robbery, and he says it was so she wouldn\'t have to, and admits to not having to be in prison long, before showing his true form, driving Morgana away. Morgana is at home, doing more research on the internet on Persian mythos. She finds references to the Djinn, a powerful being that laid waste to the Persian court before the King\'s alchemist created the Stone of the Sacred Fire and imprisoned the Djinn inside it. The Persian deity Ahura Mazda was enlisted to keep the Djinn imprisoned in the \'space between worlds\' so that he cannot escape and bring about world-wide apocalypse. Morgana is startled as her window is abruptly blown open by a sharp gust of wind, papers flying everywhere. Morgana goes to see Gregory the next day to tell him about her findings. Gregory rides to the prison with Morgana and confronts Demarest, demanding he leave Morgana alone. Demarest knows exactly who Gregory is, and about his past relationship with Morgana. He even perfectly duplicates Morgana\'s voice, speaking seductively to Gregory. Later that evening, Morgana, alone in her loft, begins undergoing a number of rituals aimed at purifying her soul, as only someone pure of heart can banish the Djinn back into his prison. Back at the prison, Demarest kills the prison warden and escapes the prison when one of the prisoners wishes to be released. Osip brings Demarest to Pushkin and tells him that Demarest is a Wishmaster who can give Pushkin anything he wants. But Pushkin brushes them off, saying he already has great wealth and power, and he doesn\'t need or desire fame. As he is leaving, Demarests asks if Pushkin has any enemies he would like to see eliminated, and Osip quickly pounces. Pushkin\'s greatest enemy is a rival crime boss named Moustafa. The mere mention of Moustafa\'s name sends Pushkin into a rage. Demarest assures Pushkin that he can do what Pushkin himself might not be able to, like take care of Moustafa. Carelessly, fueled by his anger, Pushkin wishes to have Moustafa\'s head. Just then, Morgana rushes into the club room, shooting Demarest twice in the chest with her gun. Both she and Osip freeze in horror as the attack only causes the Djinn to assume his true form. He laughs at Morgana\'s foolishly thinking she could kill him. Gregory finds Morgana praying feverishly at the church altar, and sobbing inconsolably. She confesses to Gregory that she tried to kill Demarest and then saw the Djinn\'s true face. She laments that her guilt, the blood of the innocent man she killed at the art gallery heist, can never be washed away, and so she can never hope to fight the Djinn. Gregory patiently counsels her, promising that God can cleanse any and all burden she carries if only she allows Him to, and that while the Djinn might be too powerful for they to fight, God can win the battle using them as His instruments. During this, they find Morgana is invulnerable when she attempts suicide so the Djinn can not grant ehr the three necessary wishes. Morgana and Gregory are preparing for the trip in pursuit of the Djinn. Gregory has compiled more notes, including the incantation used by the alchemist who imprisoned the Djinn: "As was prophesied, the alchemist took the stone into his hand as a woman pure of heart takes the light of God unto her soul, and spoke the words, Nib Sugaroth Baheim." Morgana points out that unlike the two of them, the alchemist knew what he was doing. But as Gregory points out, these notes are the only solid plan they have on how to defeat the Djinn. Morgana begins to kiss Gregory, and despite his initial reticence, she makes love to him. In Vegas, the Djinn begins granting wishes to the casino patrons in order to collect the remaining required souls. As Morgana and Gregory ride a cab through Las Vegas to the casino Demarest is operating out of, the Djinn stands in his office in his true form. Holding up the fire opal, he intones a deep growl and calls in all the debts owed him-- he claims the souls everyone gave up through their wishes. Noting that Demarest has left the fire opal on his desk, Gregory quietly inches toward it while Demarest is speaking to Morgana. Rushing forward, he grabs it and recites the incantation used by the alchemist. Demarest merely smiles again, noting the two of them have studied the legends well, before gesturing, and the fire opal vanishes from Gregory\'s hand into Demarest\'s. He warns them about playing with forces they don\'t understand. After morgana accidentalyl wishes for the Djinn to go to hell, they\'re transproted inside the fire opal, and Gregory is killed after shes wishes for him to be released. But Morgana has forgotten that death is often a release. She screams in grief at the Djinn, angrily wishing for a world free of evil. But the Djinn reminds her that evil is but half of a perfect sphere-- without it, good cannot exist. He warns her that he is losing his patience with her. Morgana tries desperately to resist the Djinn\'s will. Morgana\'s fears suddenly quiet and she asks the Djinn the meaning of fulfilling the prophecy. She reminds him that he himself told her that she would know when the time was right. The Djinn impatiently recites the prophecy to her, that the one who wakes the Djinn shall have three wishes; upon the granting of all three, the race of Djinn will reign over the Earth. Due to a slip of the tongue, Morgana realizes the meaning of the prophecy, and wishes for the guard she killed to be alive again. After receiving a vision of the guard alive and well, she takes the Djinn\'s fire opal and intones the alchemist\'s chant, \'Nib Sugaroth Baheim.\' Th Djinn is again banished and all the victims returned to life.'] ['In Greentown, Illinois, a small town enjoying the innocence of an upcoming autumn as the days grow shorter, two young boys—reserved Will Halloway and somewhat rebellious Jim Nightshade—leave from an after-school detention for "whispering in class" and hurry off for home.

That night, John sees Louisa emerging from the woods after having forbidden her to return to the mound. She has a rash and what looks like bite marks on the skin around her neck, and at dinner she eats in an animal manner and as though starved. John finds an article about burial mounds on the internet and telephones an expert on the subject, Professor White , but is ignored. He then reads about the previous owner of the house, Sarah Wayne: she disappeared one day without a trace, after having locked her teenage daughter in her bedroom from the outside. The daughter was eventually found alive and went to live with her grandfather, Roger Wayne . John leaves the children with a babysitter and goes to see Roger Wayne and discovers that he burned down his house with his granddaughter inside.

While John is away, the babysitter is locked out of the house and killed by the creatures. Sam hides in his room as a mound-walker tries to get in. John arrives home, discovers Louisa, and asks what happened to the babysitter, but she says she does not know. After the police leave, Louisa vomits on the hallway floor. John takes her to bed and she tearfully asks him if he\'s going to leave her like her mother did. He tells her he never will. John dreams of a doorway on top of the burial mound and Louisa transforming into a creature. The next day he finds the same kind of nest in Louisa\'s room. He decides to take action, digs up the shotgun and hires a contractor to destroy the burial mound. Before the demolition takes place, Professor White arrives and pleads with John to wait. He tells him of an ancient civilization who worshiped the burial mounds, believing them to be the homes of ancient Gods, or "mound-walkers". He mentions a ritual involving the exchange of gifts, including small straw dolls, and the mound-walkers search for a young girl to mate with who could give birth to a new generation of deities and help them reclaim the earth. Horrified by this, John instructs the bulldozer to start its work. When it cuts into the mound, the body of the babysitter is discovered. John is taken to the police station for questioning while Cassandra the teacher looks after the kids.

He sets a can of gasoline and the explosives from the postponed demolition by the entrance and crawls inside. He finds himself in a deep network of tunnels. He finds Louisa in a pit, unconscious and covered in mud. When he carries her out the creatures start to howl and give chase. In the meantime, Sam comes out of the house, clutching a family portrait, and looks towards the mound. John and Louisa escape the mound and block the entrance with a leaking canister of ANFO , but there is another mound-walker waiting for them. Louisa collapses and begs her father not to leave her. John looks down at her and sees her beginning to transform into one of the creatures. John drops a flare into the leaking diesel fuel and the mound goes up in a huge explosion. After a while, in reflection on the family portrait that Sam is holding, we see a figure emerging slowly from the flames. Sam asks "Daddy?", although the figures identity is unclear. In the background several mound-walkers crawl down the walls of the house and the tree in the yard. Directly behind Sam a creature emerges from the side of the screen. Before it growls a sound is heard that may either be a gun loading or the creature moving. It is left to the viewer\'s interpretation if John and Sam live or die.'] ['Recording some new music in an isolated farmhouse, the band Triton gets more than they bargained for when something horrifying stirs in the darkness.

In spite his friends' warnings, Baskerville pursues her throughout the moor and stabs her to death in the nearby abbey ruins. However, a huge dog-like creature suddenly appears and kills Baskerville. From then on, the hound of hell has become known as the Hound of the Baskervilles and, any strange night a Baskerville is alone on the moor, the hound will come and kill him. Several centuries later, the death of Sir Charles Baskerville is being reported by his best friend Dr. Richard Mortimer  to Sherlock Holmes  and Dr. Watson , who are willing to meet the new owner of Baskerville Hall, Sir Henry . After meeting Sir Henry, Holmes remembers that he is going to be away on the day Sir Henry arrives at Baskerville Hall, so he puts Watson in charge of watching over him. A tarantula attacks Sir Henry briefly; Holmes suspects foul play. Before he leaves, Holmes reminds Watson to not let Sir Henry go out onto the moor at dark. On the way to Baskerville Hall, the coach driver Perkins  warns of a convict named Selden  has escaped from nearby Dartmoor Prison two days ago. Watson recalls Seldon's case about Seldon murdering a number of street women; plus due to some talk of him being insane, he was sentenced to life imprisonment instead of hanging. While at Baskerville Hall, Watson meets a man named Stapleton  and his daughter Cecille , who save him from sinking into the Grippen Mire. Cecille seems to act strangely around both Sir Henry and Watson. At night, Watson sees a light shining out upon the moor, and starts to suspect something is going on. He and Sir Henry investigate the mysterious light. While out upon the moor, the Baskerville hound howls, causing Sir Henry to suffer from heart problems. As they leave, a strange man rushes past. The two pursue the man, but he gets away; they go back to Baskerville Hall. Soon, Watson discovers that the strange man was actually Holmes in disguise; Holmes had arrived hours after Watson did. They find out that the convict, Selden is actually the butler Barrymore's brother-in-law, was the one signaling with the light the other night, and that Barrymore and his wife were the ones returning the signal. Several events occur, such as Sir Henry being invited to dinner by Cecille and Stapleton, the hound mistakenly killing Selden because Selden is wearing Sir Henry's clothes, and finally Holmes' almost being trapped inside an old mine while investigating. Cecille takes Sir Henry out to the moor one night. By now, Holmes has solved the case: The Stapletons are actually illegitimate descendants of Sir Hugo, and are next in line to get the Baskerville fortune and mansion if all of the Baskervilles are killed off. Cecile has taken Sir Henry out onto the moor so that he may be killed by the hound - an actual, living dog bought by Stapleton, not a ghost as many were led to believe. Holmes and Watson rush out just on time to hear Cecile reveal her intentions to a horrified Sir Henry. Stapleton appears and attacks from behind, but in turn is shot in the side by Watson. The hound of the Baskervilles suddenly appears and attacks the group but desists when shot by Holmes; Stapleton is then mauled to death by the animal. Cecille flees while Holmes kills the beast, revealing it to be a normal dog with a mask on to make it look more terrifying. Cecile accidentally falls into the mire and slowly sinks to her death.

Marcus is accustomed to performing fake exorcisms on "possessed" individuals, but when he reads of an autistic child being killed during an exorcism, he comes to realize the potential danger of exorcism. He agrees to take part in a documentary designed to expose exorcism as a fraud, working with a film crew consisting of producer/director Iris Reisen  and cameraman Daniel Moskowitz . At random, he chooses an exorcism request sent by farmer Louis Sweetzer , who claims his daughter Nell  is slaughtering his animals while she is possessed. The team drives to the rural area of Louisiana where the Sweetzers live. After listening to the details of the case, Marcus claims Nell is possessed by a powerful demon named Abalam. Prior to the exorcism, Marcus plants hidden speakers and electronic props, so he can bamboozle the family into believing he is driving out a demon. After the ritual, Marcus and his film crew leave, believing they have cured her of a mental state that was misdiagnosed as a possession. That night, Nell mysteriously appears in Marcus\' motel room, apparently unwell. Marcus takes Nell to the hospital for tests, which conclude that Nell is in perfect physical condition. Marcus goes to see Louis\' former pastor, Joseph Manley, and asks him questions regarding Nell and Louis. Manley informs Marcus that he has not had contact with the Sweetzers for a long time. In the morning, Louis takes Nell home, but chains her to her bed after she slices her brother Caleb\'s  face with a knife.

When they try to confront her, she goes into a bathroom, where she is found submerging a baby doll in water. After she comes out of her trance, the crew finds a drawing of a dead and bloodied cat. That night Nell steals their camera and goes into her father\'s barn where she corners a cat, beating it to death with the camera. She returns to the house and raises the camera over Marcus\'s head. The rest of the crew stops her, unaware of what has transpired. They discover two more paintings of Nell\'s. The first depicts someone who appears to be Cotton standing before a large flame, holding up a crucifix. The second shows what appears to be the dead bodies of all three visitors to the Sweetzer farm: Cotton being consumed by the flame he battled in the other picture, Iris hacked to pieces with an axe, and Dan decapitated. Louis comes home and hears an answering machine message from the hospital stating that Nell is pregnant. Marcus accuses Louis of incest, which he denies, insisting that Nell is a virgin and has been defiled by the demon possessing her. Tempers flare as Marcus insists that Nell needs psychotherapy instead of another exorcism. Louis orders the crew to vacate his property. While contemplating whether they should take Nell, they hear noises upstairs. They discover that Nell has climbed atop her dresser. As they try to calm her, she slashes Marcus\'s hand with a knife and runs outside. The crew decides to leave; as they enter their van, they see Nell sitting on the porch. As Marcus approaches Nell, she tackles him. The struggle leads inside as Louis chases them with a shotgun. In order to keep Louis from killing Nell, Marcus agrees to attempt another exorcism. Marcus confronts the entity that has possessed Nell, which introduces itself as Abalam, the same demon Marcus had spoken to Louis about. Abalam agrees to release Nell from the possession but only if Marcus can remain silent for ten seconds. Abalam begins breaking Nell\'s fingers as it counts out loud. After counting to three and breaking three of her fingers Marcus yells for Abalam to stop. Abalam then asks Marcus if he wants a "blowing job." Marcus realizes that a demon would know the actual name of the sex act and concludes that Nell is actually a very disturbed girl pretending to be possessed. Nell then tells them of Logan, the boy who supposedly impregnated her. Marcus arranges for Pastor Manley to come to the house to provide solace to the Sweetzers as Marcus prepares to leave. On their way home, Marcus and the film crew detour to the coffee shop where Logan works. Logan tells the crew that the only contact he had with Nell was a brief conversation six months ago at a party that was held at Pastor Manley\'s home. Logan admits that he is gay and, therefore, did not have sex with her. Marcus and the film crew leave the cafe and begin to drive out of town. They begin to question Nell\'s story, and Marcus realizes that Pastor Manley was lying about having not seen Nell for two years. Marcus turns the van around and returns to the Sweetzer farmhouse. They enter the house to find numerous occult and countercultural symbols scrawled on the walls, but Nell and Louis are missing. Marcus and the film crew wander into the woods, where they see a large fire and a congregation of hooded cultists led by Pastor Manley. Louis is bound and gagged on a pole while hooded figures pray around an altar, atop which Nell is bound. Marcus and the film crew watch as Nell gives birth to an inhuman child. Manley throws it into the fire, which causes the fire to grow rapidly while demonic roars emanate from within. At that moment, Marcus\' faith is resolved as he grabs his cross and rushes towards the fire in a frenzied attempt to combat the evil. Iris and Daniel are discovered and run away. Iris is tackled by a member of the congregation, who kills her with an axe. Daniel tries to escape through the woods, but when he pauses to catch his breath, Caleb appears and decapitates him. The camera collapses to the ground, and, after a few seconds of stillness and silence, the credits roll.'] ["Wannabe Los Angeles rap artists Postmaster P. , Stray Bullet  and Butch  accidentally free a Leprechaun that was imprisoned by record producer Mac Daddy O'Nassas  20 years earlier.

After years of battle and defeat of the magical creatures\' forces, the master of the goblin blacksmiths offers to build an indestructible golden mechanical army for King Balor, the one-armed king of the elves. Influenced by his son Prince Nuada, Balor orders the building of this Golden Army. Soon the humans attack again but the Golden Army devastates them; Balor creates a truce with the humans to stop the bloodshed: Man will keep his cities and the magical creatures will keep their forests. Nuada does not agree with the truce, and leaves in exile. The magical crown controlling the army is broken into three pieces, one piece going to the humans and the other two kept by the elves, so the Golden Army can never be used again. In the present, Nuada declares war on the humans. He collects the first piece of the crown from an auction, massacring everyone at the site by unleashing tooth fairies, and kills his father for the second piece of the crown. His twin sister, Princess Nuala, escapes with the final piece. Meanwhile, Hellboy is having issues with his girlfriend Liz, and trouble accepting that their organization, the B.P.R.D., must remain undercover. While investigating the massacre at the auction, Hellboy allows himself to be revealed to the world. In the commotion, Abe Sapien discovers that Liz is pregnant. Furious about the public unveiling, the Bureau\'s superiors send a new B.P.R.D. agent, the ectoplasmic medium Johann Krauss, to take command. With Krauss in charge, the team tracks the tooth fairies to the troll market, an enormous merchant city hidden under the Brooklyn Bridge, to search for clues. Abe stumbles onto Nuala, who has obtained a map leading to the Golden Army, and quickly falls in love with her. She is brought under B.P.R.D. protection following an attack by Nuada\'s sidekick, the troll Wink, and an elemental forest god, both of which Hellboy kills. During the elemental fight, Hellboy is questioned by Nuada whether it is right to fight for the humans when he too is considered a monster.

However, the real map is on the canister. Nuada kidnaps his sister and critically wounds Hellboy with his spear. Unable to remove the spear shard, Liz, Abe and Krauss take Hellboy to the location of the Golden Army in The Giants Causeway County Antrim, Northern Ireland.

The goblin leads the team to the resting place of the Golden Army, where Nuada awaits them. In exchange for Nuala, Abe gives him the last piece of the crown. With the crown reformed, Nuada awakens the Golden Army, ordering them to kill the team. The group is unable to defeat the soldiers as they magically repair themselves. Hellboy challenges Nuada for the right to the crown, and Nuada is forced to accept, since Hellboy\'s father was a Prince of Sheol.

In his further efforts to confront the evil, he suffers a car wreck from brake and steering malfunction, a lack of support by his superiors in the diocese as he describes the occult things he\'s seen, and ultimately, blindness and a mental breakdown. It is most moving when he is at the altar of the church, praying, "Give them strength of mind and body, that they may do Your will," and a high-mounted statue begins to crumble and drop dust down in the chancel area. Refusing to run, he continues the prayer at a scream, "Oh, Lord, give them strength of mind and body, that they may do Your will!" weeping at the seeming triumph of evil over good.

Meanwhile Lieutenant Keiko Kirishima  has recently switched from the National Police Academy to a district police station. Her new colleagues, Detective Ishida  and Detective Wakamiya  do not understand her, and are somewhat resentful of her qualifications. Her own prickly personality does not help matters; she interprets their casualness at crime scenes as a lack of professionalism. She is unable to stomach the gruesome scene at her first case, so Ishida mocks her. Her first case is a young woman who has been found dead in her apartment, horribly slashed with a blade placed in her own hand. The fact that the apartment was locked from the inside convinces Ishida and Wakamiya that the case is a suicide; Kirishima is not so sure, as no note was left and a neighbour heard the victim crying out for help.

Afterwards, they go out to dinner where they get lost and briefly become separated. John catches a glimpse of what looks like a small child  wearing a red coat similar to the one Christine was wearing when she died. The next day, Laura meets with the sisters, who hold a séance to try to contact Christine. She returns to the hotel and tells John that Christine has said he is in danger and must leave Venice. John loses his temper with Laura, but that night they receive a telephone call informing them that their son  has been injured in an accident. Laura departs for England, while John stays on to complete the restoration. Under the assumption that Laura is in England, John is shocked when later that day he spots her on a barge that is part of a funeral cortege, accompanied by the two sisters. Concerned about his wife's mental state and with reports of a serial killer at large in Venice, he reports Laura's disappearance to the police. The inspector  investigating the killings, is suspicious of John and has him followed. After conducting a futile search for Laura and the sisters—in which he again sees the childlike figure in the red coat—John contacts his son's boarding school to enquire about his condition, only to discover Laura is already at the school. After speaking to her to confirm she really is in England, a bewildered John returns to the police station to inform the police he has found his wife. In the meantime the police have found the sisters and brought them in for questioning, so an apologetic John offers to escort Heather back to her hotel to rejoin her sister, Wendy . Back at the hotel, Heather goes into a trance as John is leaving. On his way out, John catches another glimpse of the mysterious figure in red, and this time pursues it. Coming out of her trance, Heather beseeches her sister to go after John, sensing that something terrible is about to happen to him, but Wendy is unable to catch up with him. Meanwhile, John has followed the elusive figure to a deserted palazzo, and having cornered it, realises too late that the strange sightings he has been experiencing were premonitions of his own death."] ['In 1999, ten years have passed since the fifth film; Freddy Krueger had failed to attack Alice Johnson  and her son Jacob as they have moved away from Springwood, and it states that through a series of mysterious suicides and murders every child in Springwood, Ohio has died.

Upon becoming aware of the viewer, he proffers his latest project, which he hopes will get him into Hollywood: Demon Knight. The story begins.  On a New Mexico desert road, a drifter named Frank Brayker is in a chase with a pursuer called the Collector. The vehicles crash and Brayker flees and meets the local drunk, Uncle Willie. Willie takes him to a decommissioned church that now serves as a boarding house for most of the townsfolk. He rents a room and observes the residents: owner Irene, prostitute Cordelia, postal clerk Wally, and an itinerant convict on work release named Jeryline. A misogynistic cook named Roach arrives and informs the group about a theft attempt on his employer\'s car, unaware it was Brayker, and a suspicious Irene calls the sheriff. Sheriff Tupper and his deputy Bob encounter the Collector, who convinces them that Brayker is a dangerous thief and they set out after him following Irene\'s call. At the boarding house, Tupper and Bob learn that both cars were stolen and arrest Brayker and the Collector, but the Collector kills Tupper by punching through his skull. Driven outside by a key-like artifact Brayker possesses, the Collector draws his own blood on the sand, and produces an army of demonic creatures. Brayker uses blood from the artifact to create seals on the doors and windows, keeping the creatures out, and tells the group they must wait out the night. Unable to get in, the Collector uses psychic powers to seduce Cordelia and possess her. Cordelia kills Wally and cripples Irene before Brayker kills her. The group attempts to escape through old mine tunnels under the building, but the other townsfolk, under demonic possession, drive them back into the church and upstairs until the seal on the landing stops them. The residents demand an explanation and Brayker reluctantly tells them the history of the key. Following the creation of Earth by God, there were demons in the darkness who used seven keys for focus the power of the cosmos into their hands. When discovered, God created light that scattered the demons and the keys across the universe. The artifact that Brayker holds is the last key they need to reclaim power, and to protect it God had a thief named Sirach fill the artifact with the blood of Jesus Christ at the crucifixion, which is what creates the seals that repel the demons and prevents them from touching it. The guardians of the key, immortal while holding it, have since been passing it on, refilling it with their own blood when they die; Brayker received the key from his superior officer during World War I. Danny disappears and Jeryline rallies everyone to look for him, during which Roach sneaks the key out of Brayker\'s satchel. In the attic, Irene and Bob discover that Wally was planning to attack the post office with a trunk full of weapons that includes a suicide grenade vest. The Collector possesses Uncle Willie, who attacks the others. While battling Willie, Roach brokers a deal with the Collector to trade his life for the key, but the Collector betrays him and kills him after Roach removes the seal. Brayker retrieves the key in the battle and Irene and Bob sacrifice themselves with the grenade vest, killing all the remaining minions. In the attic, the Collector possesses Danny who mortally wounds Brayker before Jeryline dispatches him. With his last strength, Brayker initiates Jeryline as a guardian of the key and then dies, deactivating all blood seals. The Collector and Jeryline engage in a confrontation at the climax of which Jeryline spits blood from the key in his face, causing the Collector to transform into a large demon before being destroyed. At dawn, Jeryline refills the key with Brayker\'s blood and boards a bus, sealing the door behind her. Down the road the bus stops to pick up a stranger who declines to get on. Dressed identically to his predecessor and carrying the same suitcase, Jeryline realizes that he is the next Collector. After exchanging a glance in passing, the new Collector begins following on foot, whistling the theme song to the Tales From the Crypt television series.  The Crypt Keeper is preparing for the premiere of his film. He informs the viewer that Jeryline lives happily ever after and is enjoying traveling the world. Once he arrives at the lavish premiere, the producers reveal their powers of "final cut" and snare him in a guillotine and decapitates him, much to his delight.'] ["The film is set in turn-of-the-century Carpathian village where a series of murders occur in which the victims are found with silver coins embedded in their hearts.

Painter Sam ([[Jason Thompson  and his girlfriend Lisa  have just moved in together when he has a terrible accident that leaves him crippled for life. Determined to help him, Lisa retains a lawyer, Steven , who has a crush on her. Due to his condition, Sam grows ever more distant from Lisa, thinking she is having an affair with Steven because they cannot have sex. Sensing Sam\'s growing distance from Lisa, Steven moves in, awkwardly offering as a gift a jewel he found hidden away in an antique desk. The jewel, unknown to Steven, is the Djinn\'s cell. Lisa inadvertently awakens the Djinn, which secretly kills Steven and takes his form. The Djinn/Steven begins making advances on Lisa to trick her into making wishes. She first wishes for the case for Sam\'s condition to be won, killing the person on the other end of the phone he was talking to after torturing him into agreeing to a settlement. The Djinn next takes Lisa out to a restaurant called The Palace to celebrate the winning of the case, asking her what she wishes for the most. When she says she wishes Sam could walk again, the Djinn grants this wish, enabling Sam to walk, but not repairing the injuries that made him crippled. They next go to Steven\'s place where they share champagne. While getting more for them to drink, the Djinn hears Lisa wish she could love "Steven" for who he really is. Aware that his true form will lose her forever, he is unable to grant it right away; he spends much time trying to decipher human love in order to "make" Lisa truly love him, and in the process he develops feelings for her.

An angel attempts to kill him and Lisa to prevent the third wish. However, Steven sends her away and kills the angel. Due to his previous planning, Steven has tricked Sam into believing Lisa has now fallen in love with Steven and this forces him to leave. Steven later arrives at Lisa\'s house with some flowers in an attempt to calm her down from the angel\'s attack and console her. He gives her a kiss, which leads to them making out and then having sex in the living room. Once Lisa calms down afterward, she realizes she has missed having sex but does not love Steven. After being asked if she loved him, Lisa runs upstairs for new clothes  and to leave Steven with his thoughts. At his wit\'s end, Steven redresses himself and heads upstairs to her bedroom, where she has finished putting on new clothes. Steven explains he gave Lisa what she wanted, but is angerily rebuffed with "thanks for the charity". The Djinn bretheren make their presence known, forcing Lisa to flee. Steven voices rage at his fellow Djinn for jeopardizing the wish, telling them he will take care of it. Using his magic to make the upstairs a looping maze, Steven brings Lisa back to the bedroom and reveals his true form her, offering Lisa a choice; take his hand as the second in command when the Djinn race takes over the world, or to be cast down to another dimension of hell. At the climax, Sam returns and tries to save the day with an angel\'s sword , but gets stabbed by the Djinn. But while the Djinn is still making attempts to convince Lisa to take his hand as the second in command, Sam invites Lisa to push the Djinn through the blade which is also in Sam. Lisa does that, and both the Djinn and Sam perish.

Ten striptease performances by topless dancers from beyond the grave outfitted in various motifs comprise most of this movie. The Wolf Man  and The Mummy are also tossed in for comic relief. Barrington doubles as the blond Gold Girl (inspired by Shirley Eaton in [[Goldfinger  while her red-headed "Shirley" character watches her perform.

Harry Angel , a downtrodden but competent private investigator, is contacted by an attorney named Herman Winesap  and instructed to meet a client named Louis Cyphre  in a Harlem church. Cyphre, an elegant, mysterious man, tells Angel about a once-popular big band crooner named Johnny Favorite who was drafted during World War II and suffered severe neurological trauma in action. Favorite\'s incapacitation disrupted a contract with Cyphre regarding unknown collateral, and Cyphre believes that the hospital has falsified records, preventing the contract from being fulfilled. He hires Angel to discover the truth, and in the process, locate Favorite. Angel travels to the hospital and discerns that the records were altered by a morphine-addicted veteran physician named Fowler ([[Michael Higgins  who admits he was paid $25,000 by a wealthy friend of Favorite\'s and a woman to do so; Fowler turns up dead shortly thereafter and Angel fears being suspected. He meets Cyphre to update him and end the job, but Cyphre pays him $5,000 to continue the search. Angel uses a journalist lover to find out most of Favorite\'s background, including his pre-war friendship with a Coney Island fortune teller. He learns that her name is Margaret Krusemark , now a prominent figure in voodoo, and travels to New Orleans to find her. Margaret divulges little information to Angel and tells him that Johnny is dead to her. To circumvent her obstruction, he tracks down Johnny\'s former secret love and discovers her daughter Epiphany Proudfoot , who was conceived during her relationship with Favorite. Epiphany is equally reluctant to speak, so Angel locates Toots Sweet , a blues guitarist and former Favorite bandmate. After witnessing Toots at a voodoo ceremony attended by Epiphany, Angel uses force to extract details of Favorite\'s last known whereabouts from Toots. In the morning, the New Orleans police inform Angel that Toots was murdered after he left; Angel later finds Margaret murdered in her home and her heart removed with a sacrificial knife. Epiphany stops by Angel\'s hotel and they have sex; during this time she reveals that Johnny Favorite was considered an extremely evil man who turned on everyone he knew. Angel suspects that Favorite is in hiding and killing off his former friends to prevent his discovery. Angel forces an attacker to take him to his employer, who is actually Ethan Krusemark, a very wealthy, powerful Louisiana patriarch and father of Margaret. Krusemark invites Angel into a shed at his racetrack and in a heated conversation, reveals the final horrible news to him about Favorite: Favorite was a powerful magician who, with the assistance of the Krusemarks, conjured and sold his soul to Lucifer in exchange for stardom, but afterward sought to renege on the bargain. Using an obscure rite and the help of his now-dead friends, Favorite kidnapped a soldier, murdered and cannibalized him in a ritual killing to steal his soul and assume the man\'s identity, but his sudden conscription and the amnesia from his injuries ruined the plan\'s fruition. The Krusemarks released him into Times Square after sneaking him out of the hospital and hoped for the best. Angel has a panic attack upon hearing this and ducks into the bathroom, wanting to know who the soldier was; he emerges to find Krusemark\'s body in a boiling gumbo cauldron and flees to Margaret\'s home to search for the soldier\'s personal effects. Angel finds a vase and breaks it open, revealing a set of dog tags with the name "ANGEL, HAROLD" stamped on them; Angel was and has been Johnny Favorite the whole time. Louis Cyphre, a pseudonym for Lucifer, appears in Margaret\'s living room and tells him that Winesap is dead, and that he has known Angel\'s true identity since the beginning; he has come to collect because of Favorite\'s attempt to break the contract. Angel refuses to believe him and is convinced that Cyphre is merely posing as the devil and trying to frame him for the murders. Cyphre exposes his true self and unleashes Angel\'s repressed memories of killing Fowler, Toots, and the Krusemarks in a fugue state induced by Cyphre. When Cyphre disappears, Angel runs back to his hotel and finds the police in his bedroom, looking over the body of Epiphany, who was killed with his pistol  and is wearing his dog tags. With Johnny finally remembering the truth, and since he will be executed for the murders, Cyphre can at last claim what is his: Favorite\'s immortal soul. Over the end credits, there is a lengthy sequence of a silhouetted Angel descending in an ancient iron Otis elevator cage, on his way to his execution and, ultimately, to Hell. As the screen fades to black, Cyphre can be heard saying, "Harry" and "Johnny," showing his dominion over their souls.'] ['After being released from prison, convicted felon Max Truemont  and his fiancée Roxanne , wish to have a fresh start by running a small diner of their own.

Suddenly, he pushes her underwater, and she begins to drown. While looking up at his face from under the water, she sees the visage of an old woman above her. She then wakes up, and we find out that she has fallen asleep and begun to drown. Her boyfriend Danny  wakes her up, and the two make out. The scene then switches to Zane, who has enlisted the help of dorky nerd Phil  to research his family history. Zane decides to visit his family home, bringing Phil, Rene, Danny, and her two sorority pledges, Julie "Cow"  and Laura "Dog" . The two pledges have been forced to dress up as animals  and are being brought to Zane\'s family home as an initiation. On the way to the cabin, Zane constantly sees an old woman on the side of the road, culminating in her appearance in the middle of the road, which causes him to almost crash. He decides she is a hallucination, and continues on to his family\'s land. Lester , the caretaker of the house, has been living in a trailer on the land, and searching for gold. It appears that he has found some, but does not tell anyone when they arrive. The college students marvel at his stuffed oddities, as he has become an amateur taxidermist. He warns the group not to go into the subcellar, or to go outside after dark. Zane does not take his warnings seriously, and they continue on to the house. Settling in, Rene enslaves Julie and Laura and forces Phil to tell how he knows so much about Rene and Zane\'s family history. Phil goes outside to get a signal on his mobile phone, but is split in half by the ghost with an axe. Thinking Phil is sitting in the car talking on his phone, the five remaining teens decide to learn more about the family history. After that, Rene decides to have a little fun with Julie and Laura by setting them a task; they must run to Lester\'s caravan and bring back one of his stuffed animals as proof they were there. They must wear one item of clothing and it can\'t be an overcoat. Julie chooses to wear her pants and Laura chooses to wear her boots, and although Laura accomplishes the task, Julie doesn\'t because she sprains her ankle. Rene says that she was once given the task but had to go three blocks, down fraternity row, and that she chose to wear a ski mask. Rene decides to give Julie one more task, and that\'s to take off her clothes, except for her underclothes, and blindfold her. Rene takes Zane\'s belt and uses it on Julie as a test of trust. Soon, Rene and Laura depart Julie and leave her standing there. Danny decides to go get Phil but finds out that he\'s dead before he gets his face cut off. When the lights go out, Zane goes out to check the machine to find it\'s still functioning normally, but the cable was cut. Zane finds Danny\'s faceless body, as do Rene and Laura. Zane, Rene and Laura dash back inside the house, thinking Lester is behind Danny\'s murder, but they find Lester dead as well. They try to escape with their car, but its sabotaged. They grab Lester\'s keys and Laura dashes to Lester\'s caravan to get his truck. While Zane and Rene are still in the house, Zane gets locked in another room and Rene is knocked unconscious with the spirit scratching the words "Sins Of The Father" on her back. Zane finally breaks through and kills the woman, but when barricading themselves in a room, the woman appears and knocks Zane unconscious. Laura returns with Lester\'s truck and the woman is about to slaughter Laura, but disappears after seeing a tattoo that\'s similar to the necklace Rene had throughout the movie. Laura escapes and Rene and Zane wake to find themselves in some kind of box. The old woman quickly grabs the necklace and drops the gold ring taken by the caretaker in the beginning of the movie. Rene and Zane scream in fear as the old woman buries them alive.'] ["The film is about a young girl named Katherine and her older friend Hester who live on an isolated farm run by Hester and her father Francis.

The film opens with a magician, Dit, torturing his former master and demanding the '3rd Eye', which will make him a full disciple of the Three-Eyed God. The master warns that Dit cannot handle all the black magic he's absorbed. Dit stabs his former master in the forehead and tries to dig out the 3rd Eye, but the old man does not seem to have it. Dit kills him. Later, we see Dit in his hotel room, bathing in reeds and herbs, trying to heal a rotting wound on his stomach, caused by too much black magic devouring him from the inside out. As the film continues, this wound festers and grows larger. In a hospital, Aajaan Panor is strapped to a bed in the psychiatric ward, as her nurse and doctor look on. The doctor prescribes a change in medication, claiming that it will not harm Miss Panor's unborn child. The nurse is a woman named Pen, who is Ta's aunt. She is also newly pregnant. Her husband, Aod, arrives at the hospital to pick her up, and together they drive to the train station to get Ta. Sepia-toned flashbacks show that Panor was tutoring both Pen and Ta. Ta's father, Prawase, falls in love with Panor; in order to marry her, he poisons his first wife, Duen. Ta's grandfather and great-grandmother enlist Dit's help to bring Duen back to life by transferring her soul into a new body. Using Ta's blood as a conduit, they encourage him chant the sutra, but he is too nervous, and the ritual fails. Now, ten years later, Ta has returned home to spend some time with his family, and they hope that he will be able to complete the ceremony this time around. The family again hires Dit to help them. Pen takes Panor from the hospital and brings her to the family barn, where Ta's grandfather has preserved Duen's corpse in salt. As the ritual begins, Pen straps Panor into stirrups and removes her foetus. As Panor struggles, Dit sees the 3rd Eye bulging from her forehead, and decides he must get it at all costs. Ta chants the sutra successfully, Panor's soul is torn from her body and trapped in a mirror, and Duen's soul settles into Panor's body. Dit ties a red string around Duen/Panor's wrist and says that it will help attach the old soul to this new body. Aod goes to bury the foetus and mirror at the base of a small shrine, but is spooked by some noises in the jungle and runs off, leaving everything behind. Meanwhile, the 3rd Eye is causing Duen/Panor to experience some creepy visions—mostly corpses of people slain in the name of black magic. While arguing with some of these invisible creatures, the red string falls off her wrist. Duen/Panor next goes to a secret hut in the jungle where she has tied up her husband, Prawase. She reveals that she is Duen in Panor's body, and accuses him of trying to abandon her. She tortures him by tearing out his toenails. When she leaves the hut, Prawase gets loose and shoots himself in the head. Deep in the jungle, Duen's soul starts to come loose from Panor's body, and she fights with Dit to keep both pieces together. In their struggles, the mirror containing Panor's soul is broken, Duen's soul is evicted, and Panor's returns. Dit runs away. At this exact moment, Ta's great-grandmother starts screaming that the family is about to be destroyed by a ghost. In the barn, Panor ties Ta's grandfather to a chair and lays out some black magic accoutrements. She pins his eyes open with safety pins, then rubs salt on them. Panor claims that she will make the grandfather watch the death of his whole family. Using her black magic , Panor causes Ta's great-grandmother to stab herself in the ear with a metal spike. In the ensuing panic, Aod hears Pen calling for him, and rushes outside to see a vision of her, bleeding. He follows the vision to the village windmill, where Panor's magic enchants a rope that becomes a noose and encircles his neck. Pen and Ta both arrive and try to save Aod, but they cannot fight the windmill, and Aod is strangled. Back in the barn, Panor instructs the grandfather to call out to Ta and Pen, and proceeds to drip hot wax into his eyes. Pen and Ta come running, but Panor causes them to lose their way. She uses her magic to cause Pen's foetus to swell up and explode out of her body. Ta finds her body and is faced with a vision of Panor. He attempts to attack her with a stick, but it passes through her body. Dit arrives, seemingly to save the day, and stabs Panor's spirit with a magic knife. He demands that she give him the 3rd Eye, but Panor is too powerful for him. She pushes Dit away and causes his ever-growing stomach wound to completely consume his chest. Ta flees and finally reaches the barn, where his grandfather is sitting at a table with the corpses of his family gathered around him. Panor arrives and captures Ta, then burns off his skin with a blow torch, as seen in the previous film. The film ends with the coda 'One Year Later', and shows Ta meeting his five school chums at the train station, thus beginning Art of the Devil 2."] ['In the prologue, the film depicts a panicky man who, for unknown reasons, murders his wife with a shotgun. The main storyline opens with Jack and Stephanie, a bickering young couple, who are lost while driving through the backwoods. We soon learn that they are on their way to meet a marriage counselor. After getting bad directions from a state trooper, the couple get into a car accident when they run over some spiked metal in the road, which Jack dismisses as discarded scrap metal; they find another car which has experienced the same fate, but the occupants are missing. Forced to proceed on foot, Jack and Stephanie find the gothic Wayside Inn, where they try to phone for help. At the inn, they meet the occupants of the other car, the engaged couple Leslie and Randy. Because the phones are inoperative, both couples are forced to spend the night at the inn, which is staffed only by the eccentric proprieter Betty, her creepy son Pete , and the gruff caretaker Stewart. After a tense dinner, in which personalities clash, the group is terrorized by a legendary local figure, the Tin Man. Armed with a shotgun, the Tin Man attempts to get into the Wayside Inn. The staff locks the Tin Man out, and he responds by giving them a message scrawled on the side of a tin can. The message declares that he will kill everyone in the house unless they give him one dead body by sunrise. The staff, blaming their guests for attracting the Tin Man\'s attention, attempts to lock them in the freezing meat locker, threatening to leave them there for weeks. A fight ensues, and the guests realize that there is a supernatural presence in the house when Betty is injured in the struggle and bleeds black fog. The couples escape the meat locker, but are unable to leave the house, which assaults them with terrifying visions involving their worst memories. For Jack and Stephanie, the visions involve their daughter, who died after falling through the ice in a skating accident. For Randy, the visions involve his abusive father. For Leslie, the visions involve an uncle named Pete, who sexually abused her when she was a little girl; these visions are intensified by the similar lusts of Pete who lives at the Wayside Inn. Confused by the visions, the four guests find themselves separated. Jack meets Susan, a young girl who has been held captive by the staff. Susan reminds Jack of his deceased daughter, especially after she claims to have been in contact with her spirit; Susan assures Jack, and later Stephanie, that their daughter is in a good place. Emotionally tormented by the visions, stalked by the homicidal Wayside staff, and under constant threat from the Tin Man, all four guests succumb to the various pressures and start to turn on each other. Shortly after, they discover that the staff worships the Devil, Jack is split into two identical people; both seem to think of themselves as the "real" Jack, yet both bleed black mist when injured, making it impossible for anyone to figure out which is the real Jack and which is the doppelganger. These couples almost escape when they are aided by Officer Lawdale , but they are recaptured when Lawdale turns out to be working with the Wayside staff. Lawdale and the Wayside staff try to force the couples to appease the Tin Man by choosing one of themselves to kill. Past tensions initially lead the viewer to believe that Randy will resolve the situation by killing Jack, but he instead turns the gun on Susan. Jack deflects the gun but Susan is hit. Desperate to appease the Tin Man, Leslie and Randy kill each other. Lawdale reveals that he is the Tin Man, and that he and the Wayside staffers are all manifestations of pure evil. Jack and Stephanie defeat their captors by channeling the energy of pure good that is flowing from Susan\'s dead body. Finally able to escape the inn, Jack and Stephanie trek back to their car, where they discover their unconscious bodies, as well as the dead bodies of Leslie and Randy; they realize that their entire experience at the inn was nothing more than a shared out of body experience. As Jack and Stephanie wake up and are taken away in an ambulance, they are watched over by a resurrected Susan, who observes that their love for each other has been reawakened by the events at the Wayside Inn. As the couple ride off in an ambulance, Jack looks out the window to see Lawdale laughing at him from the front gate of the Wayside, with the caretakers watching out of an upstairs window.'] ["Mallory  is the head of an elite government-run strike force dedicated to combating the supernatural.

The two boys do not mix well with a home in modern Chicago, their formal, Amish-like clothes from Gatlin and Eli\'s fire-and-brimstone prayer at dinner, as well as his bringing a suitcase full of corn to Chicago, striking their new parents and neighbors as rather unusual. On his first night in Chicago, after everyone else has gone to sleep, Eli quietly leaves the Porter\'s house for an empty factory on the other side of a nearby cornfield. Taking with him the suitcase of corn, Eli prays to He Who Walks Behind the Rows and plants corn seeds on the grounds of the factory. The next day, at their first day in school, Eli nearly gets into a fight with T-Loc, a student in Joshua\'s grade, and harshly criticizes Joshua for playing basketball with some of the other students. Disgusted with the lifestyle being lived by the modern child, Eli decides to bring He Who Walks Behind the Rows to Chicago, which soon kills a homeless man who finds the cornfield. Joshua starts spending less time with Eli and makes friends with neighbors Maria and Malcolm. The social worker who brought Eli and Joshua to the Porters discovers that Eli is Joshua\'s adopted brother and Eli is originally from Gatlin . She tries to warn the Porters, but she is quickly burned alive by Eli. William Porter, a businessman, finds the cornfield Eli has planted and realizes that with its seemingly perfect nature- invulnerable to disease, able to grow out of season and in the worst of soil- it could be a highly marketable product. Despite the death of his wife, which was arranged by Eli, William finds backers and looks forward to the massive profits Eli\'s strain of corn will bring. Eli neglects to inform his foster father of another property the corn possesses- it is able to turn children who eat it into followers of He Who Walks Behind the Rows. Eli begins to decisively sway the students of his high school towards his beliefs, turning them against the principal and directing them to abandon such previously-typical activities as basketball. The principal, alarmed at Eli\'s converting the students, attempts to inform other staff, but they do not believe him, as Eli\'s efforts have had another effect- they have restored order at the school to a degree few thought possible. By the time Joshua realizes the full truth, Eli has killed both of their foster parents, the school principal, Malcolm and Maria\'s parents, and now has full control of his fellow students. Confronting him, Joshua reveals that he has gone back to Gatlin and found the bible of He Who Walks Behind the Rows,  a book that Eli holds sacred and, together with his own body, can survive indefinitely if one is intact. Eli roars, "Give me the book!" and charges. Joshua throws the book down, and as Eli scrambles to pick it up Joshua stabs Eli and the book with a sickle, destroying both. After Eli dies, He Who Walks Behind The Rows rises from the cornfield, revealed to be a grotesque monster with several tentacles. He Who Walks Behind The Rows kills several of Eli\'s followers  in horrific ways, including T-Loc. After a brief struggle, Joshua uses the sickle to repeatedly stab at the monster\'s lower body, which resembles a large tree root sticking out of the ground. He Who Walks Behind The Rows collapses and dies. As the film closes, the first shipment of Eli\'s corn arrives in Germany, the beginning of shipments all over the world.'] [' Chad ([[Robert Burton  and Eddie  are college students who admire their English teacher, Julie Eldrich .

After several weeks of this, Julie announces, "The game is over." Julie reveals that it was actually she who had manipulated Chad in an elaborate role play of her own design. "Did you really think that dull, little mind of yours could possibly have conceived any of the rather dramatic experiences we\'ve shared? Why do you think you suddenly had the overwhelming desire to see what I looked like under \'all those clothes?\' Don\'t feel bad... I always get bored after a while."<ref name "Millicent and Therese"  "Amelia"  Production notes  Synopsis  Amelia lives alone in a high-rise apartment building. She returns home after shopping with a package. Inside is a Zuni fetish doll, crafted in the form of a misshapen aboriginal warrior equipped with razor sharp teeth and a spear. A scroll comes with the doll, claiming that the doll contains the actual spirit of a Zuni hunter named "He Who Kills", and that the gold chain adorning the doll keeps the spirit trapped within. As Amelia makes a call to her mother we learn that she suffers from her mother\'s overbearing behavior. Amelia struggles to justify her independence and attempts to cancel their plans for the evening because she has a date. The moment Amelia leaves the room, the Zuni doll\'s golden chain falls off without her knowing. Later, Amelia is preparing dinner, using a carving knife. She enters the darkened living room, and realizes the doll is not on the coffee table. Amelia hears a noise in the kitchen and when she investigates, the knife is missing. Returning to the living room, she is suddenly attacked by the doll, which stabs at her ankles viciously. She attempts to flee, but the doll chases her around the apartment. In the bathroom, Amelia envelops the doll in a towel and attempts futilely to drown it in the bathtub. She later traps it in a suitcase, but accidentally releases it when she opens the case to make sure the doll is dead and still inside. After several more vicious attacks, Amelia manages to hurl it into the oven and listens to it howling and screaming as it catches fire. Soon the screams die down and eventually stop. She opens the oven to ensure that the doll is "dead\', and a cloud of black smoke billows out. Inhaling the smoke, she is suddenly overcome. We see Amelia place another call to her mother. In a calm, controlled voice, she apologizes for her behavior during the previous call, and invites her mother to visit her home for dinner. She then rips the bolt from her front door and crouches down low in an animalistic manner, hiding in the corner with a carving knife. She stabs at the floor with the weapon, grinning ferally and revealing the horrific teeth of the Zuni doll whose spirit now infests her body.'] ["They tells the story of a Psychology grad student named Julia  and an event that turns her life upside down.

She returns to New York City, and finds that her sister had sold her cosmetics business eight months earlier.

Katie claims that an "evil" presence has haunted her periodically since childhood and believes that it is still following her. Each night, Micah mounts a video camera on a tripod in their bedroom to record any activity that occurs while they sleep. The first night, the camera records running footstep noises. Katie hires psychic Dr. Fredrichs, who assesses that she is being haunted not by a ghost but by a demon. He says the demon feeds off negative energy and its intent is to torment Katie no matter where she goes. He advises them not to taunt or communicate with the demon and to contact demonologist Dr. Johann Abrams for help. Though Katie seems interested in the situation, Micah does not take it seriously. During the third night, the camera captures a low rumble and the bedroom door moving by itself. On the fifth night, demonic noises are heard before Katie awakes from a nightmare before a loud thump is heard from the living room. Micah begins to taunt the demon and the phenomena worsen. On the thirteenth night, Katie is awoken by a noise in the hallway before a screech and a loud thud. The chandelier is found to be swaying when they investigate downstairs. Micah later captures a demonic grunt with a voice recorder. During the fifteenth night, Katie gets up and stares at Micah sleeping for two hours before going outside to sit on the backyard swing. Micah tries to convince Katie to come inside but she refuses. When Micah goes inside to get her a blanket, he hears a bang in the bedroom and finds the bedroom TV turned on. Micah is then startled by Katie, who followed him inside but says that he woke her up. Katie remembers nothing the next day. Katie, irritated by Micah\'s flippant response to the situation, becomes irate when Micah brings home a Ouija board despite Dr. Fredrichs\' warnings. The two go out of the house that evening, leaving the Ouija board in the living room. The curtains and plants start to blow around and the Ouija board\'s planchette moves on its own and small fire erupts on the board and extinguishes itself. During the seventeenth night, Micah sprinkles talcum powder in the hallway and when the couple is awoken by noises, they find non-human footprints leading to the bedroom from the attic. In the attic, Micah finds a burnt photograph of a young Katie, which was previously thought to have been destroyed in an unexplained house fire when Katie was eight years old. On the eighteenth night, loud footsteps wake the couple up and are heard running out of the bedroom slamming the door. The demon continues to close and bang on the door when they leave to investigate. Dr. Abrams is unavailable when Micah finally agrees to invite him, so Dr. Fredrichs comes instead. Upon his arrival, Dr. Fredrichs immediately has a sense of dread and apologetically leaves despite their pleas for his help, stating that his presence is only making the demon angry. During the nineteenth night, the bed covers move, the closet light turns on and off and a shadow is seen on the door before Katie is woken up by breathing in her face. Micah discovers a woman from the 1960s with the same haunting who became possessed during an exorcism and killed herself. Katie is pulled out of the bedroom toward the closet by an unknown force during the twentieth night and discovers bite marks on her back. Later Micah finds Katie gripping a cross so tightly that it bloodies her palm. Just as he is set to leave for a motel, Katie insists that they will be okay now, her voice flat with another voice in tandem with her own.  The following night Katie gets out of bed and stands beside it staring at Micah for approximately two hours and then walks downstairs. After a moment of silence, Katie screams Micah\'s name, waking Micah who rushes to her. The camera records Katie screaming incessantly. Then Katie\'s screaming stops and a brief silence is followed by the sound of heavy footsteps coming up the stairs. After another brief silence, Micah\'s body is violently hurled at the camera, knocking it over sideways and revealing Katie standing in the doorway. She then slowly walks into the room, her clothing soaked with blood. Crouching over his body, she sniffs Micah\'s body and then slowly looks up at the camera with a sly smile. As she lunges toward the camera, her face takes on a demonic appearance just as the scene cuts to black. An epilogue text states that Micah\'s body was discovered by the police on October 11, 2006, and that Katie\'s whereabouts remain unknown.   In its original version, the film featured a different ending. In this version, after going downstairs on the final night and waking Micah with a scream, only Katie is shown returning to the bedroom, holding a large bloody kitchen knife, her shirt bloodied. She sits beside the bed, holding the knife and rocking herself, until about 2 p.m. the next day, when her friend Amber calls and leaves a message expressing her concern. At about 9:20 p.m. that night, Katie is still sitting and rocking by the bed, and Amber can be heard entering the house. During this short period, Katie stops rocking, but when Amber screams  and runs out of the house, she resumes her motion. Half an hour later, just after 9:50 p.m., police enter the home and discover Micah\'s body as well. As they are checking Micah for vital signs, a light turns on in the bedroom down the hallway, but before the police see it, the light turns off again. They discover Katie, still sitting beside the bed with the knife. As they call to her, she wakes from her catatonic state and seems confused. As she approaches them, knife in hand, calling for Micah, they ask her to drop the weapon. Suddenly the bedroom door behind the police officers slams shut, startling them and causing them to shoot Katie, who collapses on the floor. The police then call dispatch and check the bedroom at the end of the hall, but find nothing. They discover the video camera, still running. A dedication to and a picture of Katie and Micah are then shown. The original ending for the film was available for a time for viewing on the Internet before Paramount exerted a claim of copyright on the material.{{cite news|urlSo What Was \'Paranormal Activity\'s Original Ending?|lastWilliam |dateHorror Squad|accessdate"oreninterview">{{cite web}} In this ending, Katie gets out of bed and stands staring at Micah, as she did in the theatrical ending, except she does not move to Micah\'s side of the bed. About three hours pass, then she finally goes downstairs. She lets out a blood-curdling scream, which wakes Micah up and he runs downstairs. The screaming continues, and the sounds of a struggle are heard before the noises abruptly stop. There is silence for a short while before loud footsteps are heard on the stairs. Katie then walks into the bedroom, Micah\'s blood covering her shirt, with a knife in her hand. She closes and locks the bedroom door, before walking up to the camera, standing idle briefly. She then lifts the knife and slits her own throat, then falls to the floor, dead.'] ["REC follows a television reporter, Ángela Vidal, and her cameraman, Pablo, who cover the night shift in one of Barcelona's local fire stations for the fictional documentary television series While You're Asleep. The firehouse receives a call about an old woman who is trapped in her apartment. When they arrive, Ángela and Pablo film the police breaking down the door. The woman becomes extraordinarily aggressive and bites one of the policemen. Meanwhile, the terrified residents gather in the entrance hall and look on as the firefighters and military seal off the building. A firefighter who remained in the old woman's apartment is bitten and plummets through the stairwell to the lobby floor. The camera crew, remaining Firefighter and the second policeman go up again and are attacked. The officer shoots the old woman. The camera crew remains trapped inside the building with the residents and continue recording in spite of the firefighters' pressure. Ángela interviews a little girl named Jennifer who lives in the building. Jennifer is ill with what her mother claims is tonsillitis. She says her dog, Max, is at the veterinarian because he appeared to be sick as well. A health inspector wearing a hazmat suit arrives and attempts to treat the injured, who become suddenly and fiercely violent despite their critical injuries. The health inspector explains that the time frame in which the disease takes effect varies by blood type. The health inspector also reveals that sometime during the previous day, a dog with the illness was taken to the veterinarian; the dog became violent and attacked and killed other pets at the clinic. The dog was euthanized, and was traced back to the apartment building. Jennifer, the girl who owned the dog, then suddenly vomits blood on her mother and escapes upstairs. The policeman handcuffs the mother on the stairs and proceeds upstairs with Manu. Pablo follows them. They find Jennifer, and the policeman tries to subdue her with a syringe that the inspector gave him, but she bites him. Manu and Pablo run outside where they find that the infected are trying to burst in the hallway through the textile shop. They are forced to leave the handcuffed woman and they run upstairs into an apartment, where the inspector tells the distraught residents that this unknown but virulent disease is infecting people, causing them to turn into bloodthirsty savages. More and more people in the building become infected, and Ángela and Pablo are forced to fight them off. Eventually they learn that there is a key to a door in the apartment building workshop, which leads to an exit via the sewer system. However, the key is located on the third floor in the manager's apartment. After finding the key, Ángela and Pablo appear to be the only human survivors, everyone else being dead or infected. Rather than making their way to the workshop, they are forced upstairs to the penthouse by the remaining infected. They then search the penthouse and discover that its former owner was an agent of the Vatican who was charged with researching and isolating a suspected virus believed to be the biological cause of demonic possession, which was later confirmed to exist in a young girl who was possessed. The agent kidnapped and brought the girl to the penthouse to conduct his research and to possibly cure her; during this time the virus managed to mutate and become contagious. The agent decided to seal her off, presumably to let her die of starvation and dehydration. A door to the attic opens and Pablo uses his camera to look inside. A boy jumps at the camera and breaks its light. Pablo turns on the night vision to see in the dark and discovers the sealed door referred to earlier by the agent on an audio tape. The agent abandoned his efforts to cure the girl after failing to engineer a vaccine and sealed her in the room before leaving the city. The girl monster Medeiros, now a ghoulishly emaciated figure, begins searching the kitchen area, unaware of Ángela and Pablo's presence. Pablo tries to escape, but trips and is viciously attacked with a hammer by the Girl Medeiros, causing Pablo to drop the camera. Ángela picks it up and runs, only to trip and drop the camera as well. She searches for it but is unable to find it. The camera continues to record as the screams of the infected girl Medeiros are heard on the tape recorder, and finally Ángela is dragged into the darkness, screaming."] ["The story opens with a Creole woman digging up a small briefcase from the ground in the pouring rain.

After he leaves, Rachel says how much he scares her, while Tammy flashes Ray while he eats in his truck. After work, Eden begins to bike home alone, but Eric catches up to her to talk to her about going to college in New York. While they were talking, Ray drives up and asks if Eden's alright. When he's sure, he begins to leave when another car, carrying the Creole woman from the beginning of the film, who is CeCe's grandmother passes by. CeCe's grandmother's car falls halfway off the bridge. Ray gets out of the truck and helps Eric to save the woman. Ray saves her, but the woman begs Ray to get the suitcase. As Ray reaches in the car to get it, the car capsizes into the water. The briefcase begins to move and finally opens releasing several gnarly looking snakes. As the car sinks into the bayou the snakes attack Ray. The ambulance arrives to find Ray dead along with CeCe's grandmother. CeCe arrives shaken up over the tragedy and asks what happened to Ray's body, leaving Eden speechless. The same night at the coroner's office, the coroner examines Ray's dead body apparently having been bitten by venomous snakes – presumed to be water snakes. The coroner leaves the area and comes back to see Ray's body missing and then he is killed by Ray's possessed body. Deputy Turner is also killed while returning Ray's tow truck to the show. The next day Eden is still recuperating from the night before. Rachel and her boyfriend, Sean, are at the lake, with Sean showing little emotion to Ray's death. He drank heavily leading to him ditching Rachel with Eden and having Eric chase after him. Meanwhile Tammy and Patty are planning to go to the mall to shoplift and they come across Ray's towing business. Patty goes to pee, while Tammy fixes the tires. When she's done, Tammy goes to look for Patty, only to find her impaled by battery clamps attached to chains leaving her to hang.

As Eric follows Sean to Ray's garage, Sean begins to show anger at Ray's death for his abandonment. Sean enters the area to find a picture of him when he was a little kid – showing that Ray did care about him. Sean storms out toward the garage and finds the remains of Tammy strewn around the floor. The night leads to Eden going to CeCe's grandmothers house, where she has a plethora of voodoo materials. CeCe then tells her that the snakes that killed Ray were full of the evil that her grandmother took out of men to purify their souls. Ricky, Rachel, Sean, and Eric arrive at CeCe's and find out what's going on. They try to escape town but their car is turned on its side preventing anyone from leaving the bayou. The kids all see Ray and begin to run and Ricky is caught by Ray when his leg is pinned to the stairs by a crowbar. His arm is then ripped off, causing him to bleed to death. As the others panic inside, they look and it seems as if Ray is gone. Sean leaves the house to confront Ray, while Eden grabs a rifle from the bedroom. Ray slashes Sean's face with his crowbar and then impales him through the chest. Eden and Eric drag Sean inside and try in vain to stop the bleeding, but he dies on the floor. Rachel cries over the loss of her boyfriend, while Eden talks CeCe into turning Sean's body into a human voodoo doll to control Ray. Meanwhile, Ray hooks the towing hook to the foundation of the house and pulls the front porch off, dragging Eden with it. Eden gets back to CeCe who finishes the spell, despite her leg being crushed by a support beam. Ray begins to climb the wreckage toward CeCe, but CeCe stabs Sean's body several times to slow Ray down in his advance. Ray finally reaches her and slashes CeCe's throat, while Eden, Eric and Rachel escape. As the remaining three try to escape, Ray follows in his truck and pulls beside them. He tosses a chain around Rachel's neck and drags her half way out of the car, but Eden grabs hold of her legs. As both cars are accelerating, Rachel screams and is impaled on a dead log. Eric and Eden then try to pass through the swamp to escape Ray, who dives beneath the murky water. As Eric and Eden headed for dry land, Ray attacks, missing them both, but separating them. Eden ends up in the graveyard, and Eric deeper in the swamp. Eden makes her way into a crypt where she finds an altar and an open casket where all the victims are kept. Eden tries to leave but Ray comes and locks her in. In panic, Eden hides beneath Tammy's body. Eric is then thrown into the crypt by Ray, who then goes to the altar. Eden starts to cry until Eric opens his eyes. Eden can't hide her gasp, unknowingly drawing Ray's attention. As Ray looks in to inspect the bodies, he grabs Eden's foot, but Eric began to breathe to protect Eden. Ray then stabs Eric in the head with a screwdriver. Eden then fights Ray by setting him on fire and pushing him down a chute, but he drags her with him. She then uses a charm she got from CeCe that protects against evil. Ray submits, but the snakes possessing his body emerge to try to take the charm from her. Eden escapes up the chute, using the charm as a diversion. Eden then traps Ray and the snakes in the chute. As she tries to drive off in his tow truck, she hears an inhuman shriek, signaling Ray is back. Ray chases Eden out of the truck before she can do anything and she runs to hide in the bayou. She hides behind a bush close to Ray. He hears a rustling and hacks the bush, revealing she's not there. Just then the tow truck emerges through the underbrush and crushes Ray in half against a tree, killing him. Eden then staggers off into the trees, and the two snakes can be seen crawling out of Ray's decomposing torso to find another host."] ['A sequel in name only to a 2004 film , this film is about a teacher, named Aajaan Panor , who is humiliated by some students. She turns to black magic to exact revenge. The film begins with a man in a fishing boat, accidentally stabbing his finger on a fish hook. He is taken to see a mystic, who claims that the man is the victim of a Cambodian curse. He is tied to a chair and fish hooks start to emerge from under his skin as he screams. In sepia-toned flashbacks, we learn the story of six school chums who have a grudge: Ta, Kim, Por, Tair, Noot, and Ko. Ta\'s mother died when he was young, and his father remarried Ta\'s teacher, Miss Panor. Kim was his girlfriend . The boyish Tair and stylish Noot might be lovers , and Ko is their fun-loving friend. During their last year at school, Miss Panor seduces Por . Por subsequently discovers he\'s not the only one in her bed. In addition to being married to Ta\'s father, Miss Panor is also having an affair with the sports coach . Fuelled by jealousy, Por suggests filming Panor and the coach to \'prove her infidelity\' to Ta\'s father. The six friends do so, and broadcast it to the entire school. The coach soon discovers it was them and holds the group at gunpoint while he sexually abuses them. Seeking revenge, the students approach a monk who agrees to curse the coach. A few days later, Por goes back to the monk and asks him to curse Miss Panor, too. The coach dies via fish hook. Miss Panor, who is embarrassed at her sexual exploits being revealed, is found stabbing herself repeatedly in the legs. She subsequently becomes a recluse, returning home to her cottage on the river, away from the city. The story proper begins two years after these events. The six friends gather together after Ta\'s father commits suicide in order to head to the remote village and pay their respects to Miss Panor. Upon arrival at Panor\'s cottage on the river, Noot\'s cell phone rings; her secret boyfriend wants to meet, so she makes her goodbyes and heads back to the city. Miss Panor is a polite hostess , and Ta\'s great-grandmother seems harmless enough, though he warns everyone that she is a bit senile. Miss Panor retires to a secret hut in the jungle, where she has several corpses gathered round, all of them sitting at desks, like students. Each corpse has a photo attached to it, indicating which former student it represents. At dinner that night, as the friends eat the soup Panor has made for them, Por spits up a fingernail. The group realises that the meat in the soup is, in fact, Noot. They search the cottage for Miss Panor. Kim finds a video camera with a tape that shows Miss Panor killing and eating the monk who cursed her, and then rushing towards the camera with a tree branch raised and bringing it down on whomever is holding the camera. Tair begins to have hallucinations of corpses shambling around everywhere. The group flees the house and sees a light outside. They call to the boat for help, but it drives past them. The driver takes a fatal fall from the boat, which sinks. Kim tumbles into the water and has a vision of Panor and Ta\'s father. In the vision, Panor is shown torturing Ta\'s father, on the premise that if she hobbles him, he can\'t leave her. When Panor leaves the room, Ta\'s father shoots himself in the head. Kim relates this to the others, and they find the gun. In the same room, there are also some jars filled with pickled mangos. In one of these jars, the group finds Ta\'s dead father. The group runs to the house\'s dusty old shrine to hide and pray. Tair has a laughing fit and is temporarily possessed by Miss Panor. Ko threatens Tair with the gun, but suddenly starts to writhe and flail as dozens of salamanders claw their way out of his body, killing him. The youths now decide to split up: Por and Ta go off into the jungle to find Panor, leaving Kim and Tair sitting outside the shrine, with Tair  still seeing visions of corpses. She panics and runs off, and Kim follows into the dense jungle. The boys hear Kim fall down. They run to find her, but are separated. Ta finds Kim and wrenches a piece of metal from her leg. Alone, Por has creepy visions of Panor. Ta leaves Kim to look for Por. Tair bursts from the jungle, cowering away from her visions. She seems to see Kim as a walking corpse, and in hysterics, Tair rips out her own eyes. Por finds Kim, who appears to him as Miss Panor, taunting him about their love affair. He fires the gun at Kim, but Ta rescues her just in time. Por runs off into the jungle and discovers Panor chanting in her secret hut. Por flees, but a vision of Panor appears, hamstrings him, and starts pulling out his teeth; Por crawls away and confesses that he had a love spell placed on Panor causing her to seduce him, became jealous when he found out she was also sleeping with the coach and took part in filming them and then placing a pain-inducing curse on Panor as punishment. Suddenly, his vision clears and he sees Kim and Ta. Kim is repulsed by Por\'s confession; she and Ta leave Por in the jungle. Miss Panor arrives, ties up Por, and takes him to her secret hut. She stabs him in the neck with a syringe full of a paralytic agent, then pours boiling water down his throat and slowly burns every inch of his skin with a blowtorch. In the jungle, Ta is carrying Kim on his back. She begs him to continue without her, but he refuses. The two of them come across a small shrine, on which is hanging Noot\'s bag. Her cell phone rings—it\'s her boyfriend, wondering where she is. In the secret jungle hut, Miss Panor is performing CPR on fatally burned Por in order to inflict more torture on him. Meanwhile, police officers converge outside the hut. As Miss Panor starts to use a power drill on Por\'s head, the officers break in and shoot her. Kim is rushed to a hospital. She recovers, and Ta comes to visit her. As they chat, the TV in Kim\'s room broadcasts a news show, which reports that the five students who visited Miss Panor are dead. Also discovered in the secret hut was Ta\'s charred corpse. In horror, Kim turns to see that Ta is actually a badly-burned, walking corpse. He never went with them to visit Miss Panor; he was already dead by then. As he pets Kim\'s hand, Ta explains: the video of Panor eating the monk was taken by Ta\'s father, who had threatened divorce after witnessing the tape of her and the coach. For this, Panor tortured him and he killed himself. Panor locked Ta\'s great-grandmother in a closet and left her to starve. It was Ta\'s great-grandmother who had told Panor that in order to break the spells placed on her she had to kill the monk that was paid to perform them and eat his flesh. She also warned Panor that it could drive her insane . It also becomes clear that the coach had also placed a love spell on Panor to instigate their affair just like Por did. Miss Panor was the victim of all these spells. Her attempt to free herself and seek revenge led her into insanity. She tortured Ta in all the ways that will be experienced by his friends. Ta\'s vengeful spirit had lured the group there so they could feel the pain that he went through. He only saved Kim from being killed because he still loves her. A flashback of their days in school returned. Kim and a classmate had a crush on Ta. Kim makes a bet with her classmate that if Ta doesn\'t court Kim within a week, she will "offer" Ta to her. Kim was then seen with the monk who appeared earlier, who warns her, "Once you start, it will follow you till you die." She receives a clay doll and thanks the monk. Kim jumps out of the hospital window to her death, holding the clay doll. Ta\'s burnt form lays beside her declaring his love for her.'] ["Under the leadership of their ancient and powerful leader Jozek Mardulak, a colony of vampires seek a peaceful life in the desolate desert town of Purgatory.

Miranda , Irma , Marion , Rosamund , waifish Sara , and outsider Edith  read poetry and Valentine's Day cards. The group prepares for a picnic to a local geological formation known as Hanging Rock, accompanied by the mathematics mistress Miss Greta McCraw  and the young and beautiful Mademoiselle de Poitiers . On the authority of the stern headmistress Mrs. Appleyard ([[Rachel Roberts , jittery teacher Miss Lumley  advises Sara that she is not allowed to attend. Driven by buggy operator Ben Hussey , the party pass through and arrive at the Rock by mid-afternoon. After a meal, Mr. Hussey notes his watch has stopped at the stroke of twelve, as has the watch of Miss McGraw. With permission from Mlle. de Poitiers, Miranda, Marion and Irma decide to explore Hanging Rock and take measurements, with Edith allowed to follow. The group is observed several minutes later by a young Englishman, Michael Fitzhubert , who is lunching at the Rock with his uncle Colonel Fitzhubert , aunt Mrs. Fitzhubert , and valet Albert . At the top of Hanging Rock, the group lies on the ground, apparently dazed by the sun. Miss McCraw, still at the base of the Rock, stares up. Miranda, Marion, and Irma awake and move, as if in a dream, into a recess in the rock face. Edith screams and flees down the Rock. The distraught and hysterical party eventually returns to the College, where Mlle. de Poitiers explains to Mrs. Appleyard that Miss McGraw has been left behind. Sara notes the absence of Miranda; and Mr. Hussy explains to Mrs. Appleyard that Miranda, Irma, Marion, and Miss McGraw went missing. A search party, led by Sgt. Bumpher  and Constable Jones  of the local police, finds nothing, although Edith reveals that she witnessed Miss McGraw climbing the Rock without her skirt. Michael Fitzhubert is questioned and reveals he watched the schoolgirls but can provide no clues as to their whereabouts. Michael becomes obsessed with finding Miranda; and, with Albert, he conducts another search of Hanging Rock. Despite Albert's protests, Michael decides to remain overnight and begins climbing again the next day, leaving a trail of paper. When Albert follows the markers, he finds a nearly delirious Michael. Just before leaving on a buggy with a local doctor, Michael passes to Albert a fragment of lace from a dress. Albert returns to Hanging Rock and discovers Irma, unconscious but alive. The residents of Woodend become restless as news of the discovery spreads. At the Fitzhubert home, Irma is treated for dehydration and exposure, and tells the police and Mlle. de Poitiers she has no memory of what happened. A servant notes that Irma's corset is missing but is advised by Mrs. Fitzhubert that it is not important.

He quickly deduces that Simon is involved with the Occult. Richelieu and Rex van Rijn rescue Simon and another young initiate, Tanith, from a devil worshipping cult. During the rescue they disrupt a ceremony on Salisbury Plain in which Satan himself appears. They escape to the home of the Eatons, friends of Richelieu and van Rijn, and are followed by the group's leader, Mocata, who has a psychic connection to the two initiates. After visiting the house to discuss the matter and an unsuccessful attempt to influence the initiates to return, Mocata forces Richelieu and the other occupants to defend themselves through a night of black magic attacks, ending with the conjuring of the angel of death. His attacks defeated, Mocata kidnaps little Peggy. Simon tries to rescue her, but is recaptured by the group. The Duc, Richard, and Peggy's family, also try to save her, but they are defeated by Mocata. Suddenly, a powerful force, possibly Hecate, the queen of all witches and ruler of all magic, possesses Mrs. Eaton and puts a stop to Peggy's trance. She then leads Peggy in the recitation of a spell, which kills all of the cultists and transforms their coven room into a church. When the Duc and his companions awaken, they discover that the spell Peggy was led into casting has reversed time and changed the future. Simon and Tanith have survived, while Mocata's spell to conjure the angel of death has been reflected back on him. He now pays the price of loss of life and eternal damnation of his soul for having wrongly summoned the angel of death."] ['The film opens with a car crash on Brooklyn Bridge, and introduces Henry Letham , a survivor of the crash, sitting, unharmed, next to a burning car on the bridge. Psychiatrist Sam Foster  and his girlfriend , art teacher Lila  are then introduced in a new scene. Sam discusses his patient, Henry, a college student and aspiring artist whom he describes as depressed and paranoid, with feelings of guilt and remorse over having \'set fire to\' his car at the beginning of the film. Henry mentions that he sometimes hears voices, and seems able to predict future events. Henry is also suspicious of Sam because he had suddenly been called to stand in for his ordinary psychiatrist, Beth Levy . Henry has told Sam of his plans to kill himself that Saturday at midnight, which Sam finds very troubling. Lila, who has survived a past suicide attempt, offers to help to dissuade Henry from killing himself. Sam investigates Henry\'s circumstances in an effort to help. After repeatedly attempting to reach Dr. Levy, he comes to her apartment to find her disoriented and lethargic, mumbling incoherent phrases like "I didn\'t touch him; I know you\'re not supposed to move them," occasionally belittling Sam with maudlin reference to an implied unresolved tension between the two, and the fact that she\'s aware that he\'s dating an ex-patient. Henry, who had earlier claimed to have killed both of his parents, has his account contradicted by Sam when finds Henry\'s mother ([[Kate Burton  and her dog living in a bare house, confused about Sam\'s identity  and refuses to respond to his questions. Henry\'s mother insists on feeding Sam, but when she opens the fridge it is completely empty. Her head starts bleeding and when Sam attempts to help her, her dog bites him. At the clinic, whilst having his dog-bitten arm treated, Sam discusses the visit with a present police officer  who is curious as to why he would visit that house. Sam explains what happened, but the police officer tells him that he had attended the funeral for woman who lived there years ago. This seems to send Sam into a fugue in which the same scene and dialogue is repeated several times. Later, Sam contacts a waitress named Athena , whom Henry has mentioned that he had fallen in love with. She is an aspiring actress and he meets her at a script reading where she is reading lines from Hamlet with another man. She agrees to take him to Henry, but after a long trip down winding staircases he loses her. When he gets back to the rehearsal room, she is there reading the same lines as when he first met her. The search continues until 11:33 pm on Saturday, less than half an hour before Henry plans to kill himself. At a bookshop known to have been frequented by Henry, Sam finds a painting that Henry had painted and bartered for books about Henry\'s favorite artist. He learns that the artist had killed himself on Brooklyn Bridge, on his twenty-first birthday. Henry\'s twenty-first birthday is Sunday, and Sam realizes that Henry plans to commit suicide on Brooklyn Bridge in imitation of the artist. Sam finds Henry on the Brooklyn Bridge in a physical atmosphere that is increasingly unraveling. After failing to dissuade Henry, Sam turns away as Henry puts the gun in his mouth and pulls the trigger. The car crash of the first scene is then reprised. Henry was fatally wounded in the crash but, in his last moments, is suffering survivor guilt. Each of the characters introduced earlier in the film was in fact a random spectator at the site of the crash, including Sam, a doctor, and Lila, a nurse, who treat Henry in an attempt to save him. The brief remarks they make are the same ones heard previously by their dream-world counterparts earlier in the film. They fail to rescue Henry, and Henry dies, but not before seeing Lila as Athena and proposing to her, which Lila accepts out of sympathy. The entire film up until Henry\'s death had existed only in his mind - in his last moments... (a plot device used most famously in the short story An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge and also in the film [[Jacob\'s Ladder . However, there are clues that the people surrounding Henry as he lay dying were actually drawn into another world in some way. For instance, after Henry dies and is being loaded into a body bag, Janeane Garofalo\'s character is heard telling her name to the police: Elizabeth Levy. Since Henry died before hearing this, he would have no way of knowing how to "dream" her true name. Additionally, before parting, Sam appears to get a flash in his mind of the experiences between him and Lila that Henry had constructed, and asks Lila out for coffee.'] [' A woman  is in an abandoned house looking for her boyfriend. After she discovers his body, she is stabbed in the head, and her body is dragged through a cellar door. In New York City, Bob  and his parents, Norman and Lucy Boyle , are moving. Norman\'s ex-colleague, Dr. Peterson, who murdered his mistress before committing suicide, was the previous owner. The Boyles are to stay there, whilst Norman researches old houses. As his mother packs, Bob looks at a photograph of a house and sees a girl in it who warns him to stay away. In New Whitby, Boston, Bob waits in his parents\' car while they collect keys. The girl from the photograph appears across the street. The girl, Mae , psychically warns Bob to stay away. In the real estate office, Mrs. Gittelson  is annoyed when her colleague hands the couple "the Freudstein" keys. She insists it is called "Oak Mansion". Gittelson promises to find a babysitter. Oak Mansion is in a poor state of repair. The cellar door is locked and nailed shut. A woman arrives and introduces herself as Anne, the babysitter . That night, Norman hears noises and finds Anne unblocking the cellar door. The next day, Norman goes to the library to peruse Peterson\'s materials. The assistant librarian, Daniel Douglas , informs Norman that Peterson conducted private research at the house. He studied records of area disappearances and other demographic data. Mae shows Bob a tombstone on the grounds marked "Mary Freudstein" and says she is not really dead. Indoors, Lucy finds the tombstone of "Jacob Tess Freudstein". When Norman returns, he reassures her that some old houses have indoor tombs, because of the hard wintry ground. Norman opens the cellar door and walks down the stairs only be attacked by a bat, which he stabs. Spooked, the family drives down to the estate office and demands to be re-housed, but are told it will be few more days before they can move. While the Boyles are at hospital to treat Norman\'s injuries from the bat, Gittelson arrives at the house to tell them of a new property. Letting herself in, she stands by the Freudstein tombstone, which cracks apart, pinning her ankle. A figure emerges, stabs her in the neck with a fireplace poker, and drags her into the cellar. The next morning, Lucy finds Anne cleaning a bloodstain on the kitchen floor. Anne eludes Lucy\'s questions about the stain. Over coffee, Norman tells Lucy that he\'s discovered that Freudstein was a Victorian surgeon who conducted illegal experiments. Norman must travel to New York to research Freudstein. On the way, Norman drops by the library and finds a cassette of Peterson, which explains Freudstein killed his family. Anne goes to the cellar looking for Bob, but is decapitated by Freudstein. Bob sees Anne\'s head, and exits screaming. Lucy refuses to believe Bob\'s tale about Anne. That evening, Bob returns to the cellar looking for Anne. Lucy hears Bob\'s cries and tries to open the cellar door. When she cannot open the door, Norman returns and attacks it with an axe. The rotting hands of Freudstein  appear and restrain Bob. One axe blow chops off the monster\'s hand, and he staggers away, holding Bob. The cellar contains mutilated bodies, surgical equipment and a slab. Freudstein is a living corpse with rotting flesh. Norman tells Lucy the 150-year-old Freudstein lives by using his victims\' parts to regenerate blood cells. Norman attacks Freudstein, but the ghoul twists the axe away. He grabs a knife off a tray and stabs Freudstein. Freudstein picks up Norman and rips his throat out. Lucy and Bob climb a ladder leading to the cracked tombstone. Lucy strains to shift the stone, but Freudstein grabs her. Freudstein kills Lucy by ramming her head into the concrete floor. As Freudstein advances up the ladder, Bob strains to escape. Suddenly, Bob is yanked upwards and finds Mae. With Mae is her mother, Mary Freudstein , who urges them to leave. Freudstein leads Mae and Bob down the wintry grove into a netherworld of ghosts and sadness.'] ['Following the memorial service for investigative reporter Joe Strombel , Strombel\'s spirit finds himself on the barge of death with several others, including a young woman who believes she was poisoned by her employer, Peter Lyman . The woman tells Strombel she thinks Lyman, a handsome British aristocrat with political ambitions, may be the Tarot Card Killer, a notorious serial killer of prostitutes, and that he killed her when she stumbled onto his secret. The Tarot Card Killer left a card on each murder victim\'s body. Sondra Pransky  is a beautiful but somewhat awkward American college journalism student on vacation in London. Pransky attends a performance given by magician Sid Waterman , aka "The Great Splendini", and agrees to participate on the stage. While in a booth known as The Dematerializer, Pransky encounters Strombel\'s ghost. The ghost has escaped the Grim Reaper himself to impart his suspicions of Lyman to a journalist who can investigate the story.The scene was influenced by one from Federico Fellini’s Nights of Cabiria, in which a stage musician about to be exposed as a fraud performs actual magic. Sondra decides to infiltrate Lyman\'s privileged world and find out if he truly is the dreaded criminal, enlisting Sid in the process and taking advantage of his powers of deception. Sondra catches Lyman\'s attention by pretending to drown near him at an exclusive club\'s swimming pool. When he rescues her, she introduces herself as Jade Spence, daughter of a wealthy oil family from Palm Beach. While Sid poses as her father, "Jade" begins dating Lyman. Sondra is convinced Lyman is the murderer, but Sid finds it hard to believe. As the film progresses, however, Sondra falls in love with Lyman and begins to trust him. Meanwhile, Sid becomes less sanguine about Lyman as he notices more and more inconsistencies, especially after he and Sondra find a Tarot deck hidden under a French horn in Peter\'s vault, a climate-controlled music room containing expensive antique musical instruments. Sid finally prevails upon Sondra to write a news story implicating Lyman, but the newspaper editor refuses the story because of Sondra\'s lack of proof. Throughout their investigations, Sid and Sondra have a relationship that is in turns friendly, paternal, and also antagonistic—fueled largely by Sondra\'s annoyance that her smooth "Jade Spence" charade is being compromised by Sid\'s obnoxious attempts to act the part of a nouveau riche oil baron. Soon the police arrest the real Tarot Card Killer. Sondra, relieved that her suspicions were for naught, reveals her real name and the deception she and Sid had practiced. Lyman is surprisingly gracious, and tells Sondra he desires to keep seeing her. They plan to spend the weekend at Lyman\'s isolated country estate. Later, Sid  suggests that Lyman used the Tarot Card murders to cover up a murder he committed. While Sondra and Lyman vacation in the country, Sid continues to investigate this theory. He finds that Lyman did frequent a prostitute, Betty Gibson, who was later killed, apparently by the Tarot Card Killer. Gibson is described as a "baby-faced blonde"  before Lyman convinced her to dye her hair, presumably to match the profile of the other Tarot victims. When Sid calls Sondra with his findings, she waves them off. Unbeknownst to her, Lyman is ominously listening in on another extension. Sid breaks into Lyman\'s vault again, this time finding a mysterious key, which turns out to be for Betty Gibson\'s flat. Meanwhile, out on a rowboat in Lyman\'s lake, Lyman confesses to Sondra that he killed Gibson to stop her blackmailing him, and he used the Tarot Card pattern to allay suspicion, just as Strombel had told Sid. Lyman comments on the irony that he first met Sondra by saving her from drowning, and now she really would drown. He would kill Sid later; no one would connect an obscure stage magician\'s death to that of a clumsy journalism student. This scene is intercut with shots of Sid driving madly to the Lyman estate to rescue Sondra, a shot interrupted by an off-camera crash. After his confession, Lyman throws Sondra into the lake and watches her go under. He then calls the police to report her drowning death. When they question him, he tells them of how Sondra was a terrible swimmer and how she almost drowned that first day at the pool. Suddenly, Sondra enters, soaking wet but smiling cheerfully. She informs Lyman and the police that the drowning had been an act to get his attention, and actually she was a very good swimmer. Back in the newspaper offices, the editor who previously rejected Sondra\'s article now congratulates Sondra on a brilliant piece of investigative journalism, the start of a promising career. Sondra seems flattered, and says she must also credit Joe Strombel and the late Sid Waterman, Splendini, who is now a passenger on the Reaper\'s ship, performing for his fellow spirits the same magical gags and comedy routines he did in life.'] ["CID detective Rockman was sent to Thailand to investigate a case involving the Hong Kong and Thai underground syndicate.

Billy recently defended an underworld crime boss named Richie "The Hammer" Ginelli  in court. The town is in the middle of a carnival, which is run by gypsies whom the town seems to have prejudices against. While driving one night, Billy accidentally runs over an elderly gypsy woman named Suzanne Lempke  with his car . The death is ruled accidental, and no charges are filed against him. Suzanne\'s 106-year old father, Tadzu Lempke , who is outraged by this, curses Billy by touching his face and saying the word "thinner". Billy begins to lose weight rapidly, regardless of how much he eats. Heidi, concerned, brings in Dr. Mike Houston , with whom Billy thinks perhaps his wife is having an affair. It is revealed that the man also cursed Judge Cary Rossington ([[John Horton  and Police Chief Duncan Hopely , who helped him avoid punishment in court. Judge Cary\'s curse was "Lizard"; he is now growing scales all over his body, eventually heading to the Mayo Clinic for help. His wife, Leda , furiously blames Billy for what is happening to Cary. Duncan becomes mutated with over-sized pimples and ends up committing suicide. Billy continues to lose weight and calculates that he only has a couple weeks to live. Because only Lempke can remove the curse, Billy intends to search for the gypsy carnival but learns it has moved. When Heidi continually mentions Dr. Houston, who is also repeatedly visiting their home, Billy is convinced of her affair and vows vengeance. He finds the gypsy camp and tries to reason with Lempke, but Lempke, unconvinced, tells Billy to leave. After being informed that Cary committed suicide, Billy enlists Richie Ginelli\'s help; Richie pays a local man named Frank Spurton  to track down the gypsies and himself kills off the gypsy camp\'s dogs. Gina, Lempke\'s great-granddaughter, and her husband Gabe, kill Frank in retaliation. In response, Richie opens fire on the gypsy camp, killing Gabe. The next day, Richie lures Gina away to kill her but Billy stops him. While balancing acid on Gina\'s forehead, Richie gives her a message for her great-grandfather: meet them in two hours. Lempke arrives at the meeting, finding a very thin and sick Billy. Convinced that only by lifting the curse can he prevent further attacks on his people, he explains that he cannot remove the curse but it can be transferred to another.

Sergeant David Tate  gets caught in barbed wire, and Private 1st Class Charlie Shakespeare  is unwilling to rescue him. The next morning, the survivors find themselves slowly advancing through a dense mist, which contrary to their fear is not a poison gas. As they emerge from it, the British come across a complex network of German trenches, where they find an apparently besieged handful of terrified German soldiers. Private Thomas Quinn  shoots the first and attempts to shoot the second, but Private Willie McNess  stops him and the German stumbles down the trench. The third German is left, a young man named Friedrich . Convinced that they have broken through the enemy lines, the soldiers decide to secure the trenches. Doing so, they explore them and find ominous signs that something there has gone very wrong: they find rotting bodies everywhere, often wrapped in barbed wire. When detonating charges to close off some passages, they hear a demon like growl and as they walk away fail to notice vast amounts of blood pouring from the mud. Later, while Private Jack Hawkstone  is exploring more of the trench, he is called away by the other soldiers. But as he turns, he notices a body covered in mud and leaned against the wall of the trench. It turns out to be the second German who got away and as Hawkstone calls for help the German jumps at him with a shank and Hawkstone is forced to shoot him. This does not kill him and as they wrestle in the mud, Private Barry Starinski  runs up and shoots the German. He falls to his knees and Quinn finishes him with a shot to the head. The sudden isolation and sinister nature of the trenches soon starts to exact a toll on the British. Plus, one of them, Private Colin Chevasse , is slowly dying from a spinal injury, and the crystal radio they found cuts out after its first legible message, denying them any means to call for support. They all vent their rage upon the German prisoner, who is abused by everyone, except for Shakespeare. During their first night, Starinski, is distracted by strange sounds and led deeper into the trenches, where he finds more German dead wrapped in barbed wire, albeit standing up. As he shouts to alert his comrades, one of the corpses suddenly comes to life and ambushes him and later, his comrades find Starinski wrapped in barbed wire, dead. After suspecting the German prisoner, the men violently interrogate him, but Charlie manages to translate his ramblings from French, saying that they will turn on each other and that there\'s "evil" in the trenches. Captain Bramwell Jennings , the commander of the battered company, is terrified by hearing strange noises of an incoming infantry charge followed by artillery fire, and runs through the trenches in search of Sergeant Tate, who has sent Hawkstone searching for the captain. More and more frightened, Jennings finally stumbles in the central area of the trench, where the squad has piled the corpses of the many German dead soldiers, and, his nerves on edge, when Hawkstone reaches him from behind, shoots him in the head. Despite that, Tate still fiercely follows orders and refuses to abandon the trench. That same day, the men, believing the attacks and the strange events to be actions done by Germans still hiding in the trench, seals off more passages in an attempt to drive off the enemy. In the night, more strange noises are heard, and the men\'s morale and discipline deteriorates even further, with Quinn especially near the border of insanity. Later, after McNess is pursued by an eerie red mist and completely drenched in blood and fear, he runs off, but is shot by a man who turns out to be Private Anthony Bradford . A rescue attempt is made by Corporal "Doc" Fairweather , the company medic, but McNess, crawling across the ground, is pursued by a moving mud mound that drags him underground. Meanwhile, Bradford, who has been found by Shakespeare, is convinced that he is possessed by death, that the whole trench is, and that he is to be killed, urging Shakespeare to do so. When the latter refuses, Bradford runs away. In the morning, Quinn decides that he has had enough and ties up Friedrich outside the trench and mutilating him, daring any Germans there might be to shoot him and save their comrade. In the trench, Jennings suddenly decides he wants a company inspection, and relieves Tate when the he refuses to comply. Fearing for the outcome of the standoff, both Shakespeare and Fairweather comply with the order, saving Tate from discipline. In the meantime, Jennings notices Friedrich screaming and moves off, going after Quinn. He demands that he too follow orders, but Quinn, already in a murderous frenzy, beats him and stabs him, then confronts Tate, who, though manages to break Quinn\'s arm, falls into and is hampered by barbed wire and killed by Quinn with a trench club. Quinn then taunts Shakespeare, who holds him at gunpoint, calling him a coward and daring him to shoot. However, barbed wire suddenly appears from out of the ground, wrapping and mauling Quinn, at which point Shakespeare shoots him to end his torture. Back in the trench, Charlie unties Friedrich, to whom he gives a rifle. Charlie runs off looking for Fairweather. He finds that the paralysed Chevasse, now pale and pestered by flies, appears to be able to move his legs again. However, when Charlie lifts up the blanket that was covering him, he discovers, much to his horror, that rats have been eating Chevasse\'s legs. Horrified, Chevasse begins to scream uncontrollably, forcing Charlie to shoot him in the head to put him out of his misery. Charlie runs off again and finds the two remaining soldiers, Bradford and Fairweather. Bradford has tied Fairweather up with barbed wire and shoots Fairweather in the head before Charlie can stop him. Charlie finally gives Bradford what he wanted and stabs him in the stomach with his bayonet and then shoots him. At that point, the soil under the German dead starts to cave in, while barbed wire blocks off every passage. As Charlie tries to escape, he stumbles and is sucked in as well. He wakes up in a dark cave filled with corpses, at which end he finds living versions of the whole group while they were eating just the other night, himself as well. He shouts defiantly that he isn\'t dead and runs off, reaching the surface of the trenches. Friedrich appears and points his rifle at him. Charlie is exasperated, and tells Friedrich that he helped him. He acknowledges, in perfect English, that indeed only Charlie helped him and that\'s why he is free to go. Charlie asks what\'s out there, but Friedrich has already disappeared. Charlie climbs out and leaves to an unknown fate, disappearing into the mist. Later, another team of British soldiers arrive at the trench and seeing Friedrich they shout at him to surrender and lift his hands. In the last scene, Friedrich gives the camera a knowing stare before the screen fades.'] ["Special Agent Jennifer Beck  is an intrepid FBI agent who is assigned to solve the case of a multimillionaire couple's missing daughter.

They all stay in the mansion where they are submitted to various tests to force them to transform into a werewolf. The entire house is under surveillance by Tom  and Pavel , who doesn\'t believe in werewolves.

He defends a schoolteacher, Mr. Gettys, against a charge of child molestation. During the trial, Kevin realizes that his client is guilty, and a reporter tells him that a guilty verdict is all but inevitable. However, through a harsh cross-examination Kevin destroys the credibility of the victim, Barbara, and secures another not guilty verdict. As he celebrates, Kevin is approached by a representative of the New York law firm Milton, Chadwick & Waters, who offers him a large sum of money to help the firm with a jury selection. After Kevin\'s jury delivers a not guilty verdict, John Milton  offers him a large salary and a swanky apartment if he joins the firm. Despite warnings from his Evangelical Christian mother, Alice, about sinful big city life, Kevin accepts the job and moves with his wife Mary Ann to Manhattan. Kevin first defends a Voodoo sorcerer, Phillipe Moyez, who ritually sacrificed an animal. He compares the incident to kashrut law and claims that his client is protected under freedom of religion, winning the case. Kevin spends an increasing amount of time at work, leaving Mary Ann feeling isolated. Kevin\'s mother visits briefly, and tells Kevin she wants to take Mary Ann back to Gainesville after seeing her mental state; however, Kevin refuses to let her take Mary Ann.

At that moment, Barzoon is beaten to death by vagrants, who take on demonic appearances. Mary Ann witnesses this, further eroding her sanity. While preparing Cullen\'s mistress Melissa to testify about Cullen\'s alibi, Kevin realizes she is lying and tells Milton he believes Cullen is guilty. Milton offers to back Kevin regardless. Kevin decides to proceed with her testimony and wins an acquittal. After the trial, Kevin finds Mary Ann in a nearby church, naked and covered with cuts. She tells her husband that Milton raped and mutilated her, but Kevin saw Milton in court with him at the time of the alleged attack; he believes that Mary Ann injured herself, and has her committed. Kevin is approached by U.S. Attorney Weaver with knowledge of the law firm\'s illegal activities. Although Kevin tries walking away, he stops when Weaver tells him that Gettys was found with a dead girl in his car trunk. Following Kevin, Weaver walks into the street and is run over by a car. Alice and Pam, Kevin\'s case manager at the firm, visit Mary Ann. Alone with Mary Ann, Pam appears as a demon through a mirror. Mary Ann attacks Pam with the mirror and locks herself in the room. As Kevin tries to break down the door, Mary Ann takes a piece of broken glass from the mirror and cuts her throat with it, killing herself. Before he can mourn, Alice reveals that Milton is Kevin\'s father. Kevin leaves the hospital to confront Milton, who gleefully admits to raping Mary Ann. Kevin fires a pistol into Milton\'s chest, but the bullets have no effect. Kevin realizes that Milton is not only his father, but also Satan himself. Kevin blames Milton for everything that happened, but Milton explains that he merely "set the stage", and that Kevin could have left at any time. Kevin realizes that he always wanted to win, no matter the cost, and left Mary Ann behind. Milton explains that he wants Kevin and Christabella, who is Kevin\'s half-sister, to conceive a child: the Antichrist. He offers Kevin anything that he wants. However, when he asks about love and Milton dismisses it as overrated, Kevin rejects his Satanic heritage, cites free will and shoots himself in the head, ruining Milton\'s plan. Kevin wakes up during the recess of the Gettys trial. After embracing Mary Ann, Kevin announces that he can no longer represent his client, despite the threat of being disbarred. A reporter follows Kevin and Mary Ann, pleading for an interview and promising to make Kevin a star. After some prodding from Mary Ann, Kevin reluctantly agrees. After Kevin and Mary Ann leave, the reporter shapeshifts into a grinning Milton. Breaking the fourth wall, he says, "Vanity &mdash; definitely my favorite sin."'] ['It\'s a week after the rapture and the millions of people who vanished into thin air are still missing. Chaos rules the world as panic and grief-stricken survivors continue to search for their lost loved-ones. Suicide rates are skyrocketing, businesses and homes are being looted, and martial law is in effect. A desperate world looks to the leadership and guidance of UN Secretary General Nicolae Carpathia, the only person offering any answers, hope, and plans to restore peace and order. While Carpathia has the world\'s adoration and trust, he is seemingly unaware of a small group of rebels spreading the truth that he is in fact the Antichrist. Buck Williams  is a highly respected television journalist who has seen firsthand Carpathia\'s manipulative and deadly powers. His position allows him special access to a global audience through the media and to Carpathia himself. Airline pilot Rayford Steele ([[Brad Johnson  and his 20-year-old daughter, Chloe , make up the rest of this group. Ray is still struggling to come to grips with the loss of his wife and son, but his recent salvation and friendship with Pastor Barnes have brought him back to the church and closer to his feisty daughter. Ivy Gold, Buck\'s assistant from the first movie, comes into the GNN headquarters and they go to Buck\'s apartment so they can work on the story of the vanishings. As the Tribulation Force struggles to open the eyes of the world to the truth, Global events get even stranger when word leaks out that three men have mysteriously burned to death at one of the holiest sites in Israel: the Western Wall. At the same time, Rabbi Ben Judah, one of the leading religious scholars of his time, plans to make a world-altering announcement based on years of research. Pastor Barnes believes both events are linked to Carpathia, signaling the oncoming terror of The Tribulation. He acts quickly by getting Ray and Buck to embark on a dangerous mission to infiltrate Carpathia\'s organization. They must get to Ben Judah before he makes his announcement. Buck is going to the Wailing Wall to get the witness on tape, but Steve Plank tries to talk him out of it. Bruce wants Rayford to join Carpathia\'s staff as the pilot of the new plane that the US government gave to Nicolae. Rayford initially turns down the mission. Rayford, while grieving about his family, receives a call from Chris . He goes to Chris\' apartment, and saves Chris\' life and soul because Chris wanted to commit suicide. Rayford then accepts Bruce\'s mission, to spy on Nicolae. Chloe is concerned for Buck and Rayford, but Buck starts to care for Chloe. Rayford then heads to Hattie to try and fly the plane. Initially, Hattie is suspicious of Rayford , but Rayford convinces her that he is the right man for the job. Meanwhile, Chloe goes to Bruce and asks about relationships during this time of chaos. She then goes to Buck\'s apartment where she sees Ivy Gold, Buck\'s assistant. Ivy blows Chloe off, thinking that she is just some star-struck fan of Buck\'s. Buck tries to call the Steele\'s house, but Chloe doesn\'t want to chat with him. When Rayford finally picks up the phone, he uses a bit of deception to have Buck meet with Chloe. When Buck leaves his apartment, he is taken to the roof of his building where he has a meeting with Nicolae. Buck is granted access to the Wailing Wall, and he goes to meet with Chloe. Chloe first blows him off, but some deception from Rayford gets them to talk. Buck and Chloe make up and start a relationship. Rayford and Buck then leave for Israel. Meanwhile, Ivy starts to visit Chloe at the church, initially to apologize for her behavior, and then later because she starts to become friends with Chloe and Bruce. Nicolae then ups the security at the Wailing Wall; and, with the help of Steve Plank, they create a "One World" religion. At the airport before leaving for Israel, Buck and Chloe share some time together. Rayford tells Chloe that he will watch over Buck. On the airplane, Rayford attempts to find some solid evidence about Nicolae. He finds some information on a computer pertaining to Rabbi Ben-Judah. While obtaining the evidence, Nicolae comes in and congratulates Rayford on being the pilot. As Rayford hands Nicolae their ETA, he sees a vision that disturbs him. When on the ground in Israel, Rayford shows the email he downloaded from Nicolae\'s computer to Buck. They realize that the conversation about Ben-Judah was about the speech he was going to give. Steve and Nicolae changed the speech because Ben-Judah was going to announce Jesus as the Son of God. Instead, because of the new changes, Ben-Judah is going to announce Nicolae as the Messiah. Buck goes to meet Rabbi Tsion Ben-Judah. He asks the Rabbi to come and discredit the witnesses, and prove that Nicolae is the messiah. He agrees. Nicolae puts added security on the wall, and Rayford and Buck pray to God to help the get message out. They go to the Wailing Wall to meet the two witnesses. Rayford distracts the guards  and Buck and Ben-Judah slip through to confront the two men. Ben-Judah chats with the two men and learn about Jesus. They are attacked by UN guards and the two witnesses breathe fire at their attackers and they die. During the broadcast, Nicolae cuts the feed right in the middle of the Ben-Judah/Two Witnesses confrontation. Buck then learns that the broadcast got cut and Ben-Judah ran off. Ivy comes to the church to give Chloe some food, and witnesses Chloe ministering to a severely burned fireman who then passes away. Ivy hugs Chloe, and states that the fireman was at peace. Chloe remarks that he found God. Nicolae comes to the Temple Mount and speaks to the masses. Rabbi Ben-Judah then comes to the Temple Mount and starts giving his speech. Nicolae, along with his advisors, watch the broadcast. Rayford, in the cockpit, asks the copilot to take over. He then goes out and pulls the fuse to stop Nicolae from ruining the broadcast. Rabbi Ben-Judah then gives the speech about Jesus being the messiah, and how he needs to be forgiven. Nicolae then orders the broadcast to be cut. In Chicago; Ivy, Chloe and Bruce are watching, with Ivy crying. When the broadcast is cut, Ivy is stunned but Chloe leads her to Jesus with Bruce praying with them. In Israel, Ben-Judah\'s announcement leaves the crowd mixed. Buck asks Ben-Judah if he will be ok, Ben-Judah states that Buck helped millions learn the truth. Back in the cockpit of the airplane, Rayford hangs up pictures of his wife and son. He is finally at peace about their disappearing. Carpathia, filled with rage, tells God that it is his time to rule the Earth. Back in Chicago at the New Hope church, Bruce is leading worship. Ivy, Chris, Rayford and Chloe are singing a hymn  when Buck enters. Buck hugs everyone as they continue to sing.'] ['A concentration camp survivor named Samuel Berg , a preternaturally lucky fellow, runs a European casino.

Unable to research their discovery, the trio establish a paranormal exterminator service known as "Ghostbusters" in a retired firehouse. Lacking customers and faced with dwindling funds, they are eventually hired by the Sedgewick Hotel to investigate a haunting. At the hotel, they capture their first ghost and deposit it in a "containment unit" located in the firehouse basement. Paranormal activity begins to increase in New York City, and the Ghostbusters become celebrities containing it, while at the same time becoming increasingly burdened by the hectic schedule. The group later hire a fourth member, Winston Zeddemore , to help them cope with the demands. The Ghostbusters are hired by Dana Barrett , whose apartment is haunted by a demonic spirit called Zuul, a demigod worshipped as a servant to Gozer the Gozerian, a Sumerian shape-changer god of destruction. Venkman takes a particular interest in the case, competing for Dana\'s affection with her neighbor, Louis Tully . As they investigate, Dana is possessed by Zuul, which declares itself "The Gatekeeper", and Louis by a similar demon called Vinz Clortho, "The Keymaster." Both demons speak of the coming of the destructive Gozer, and the Ghostbusters plan to keep the two apart. Thereafter, the Ghostbusters\' office is visited by Walter Peck , a lawyer representing the EPA, who arrests the team for operating an unlicensed nuclear device in their basement and orders their ghost containment grid deactivated, unleashing hundreds of captured ghosts onto the city. Freed from the Ghostbusters\' custody, Louis/Vinz advances toward Dana/Zuul\'s apartment while the escaped ghosts create havoc throughout the city. Consulting blueprints of Dana\'s apartment, the Ghostbusters learn that it was built by mad doctor and cult leader Ivo Shandor, who designed the building as a gateway to summon Gozer and bring about the end of the world, claiming humanity was too sick to survive after the horrors of World War I. The Ghostbusters are brought to the mayor\'s office and freed in order to combat the paranormal activity, but are unable to prevent the arrival of Gozer, who initially appears as a woman . Briefly subdued by the team, Gozer disappears, but her voice echoes that the "destructor" will follow, taking a form chosen by the team. Venkman, holding that this means that whatever they imagine will appear as a destroying force, urges his comrades to avoid giving form to the destructor by clearing their minds. Unable to keep his mind blank, Stantz remembers a beloved corporate mascot from childhood, "something that could never, ever possibly destroy us," whereupon the destructor arrives in Stantz\'s chosen form of the giant Stay Puft Marshmallow Man and begins laying waste to the city. To defeat this manifestation, the team decides to merge the energy streams of their proton packs  while directing these against Gozer\'s entrance. The plan succeeds, banishing Gozer back to whence it came, sealing the gateway between the worlds, and destroying the Marshmallow Man in a single explosion. Soon thereafter, Dana and Louis are freed from the ashen remains of their possessors. As hundreds of New Yorkers wipe the melted marshmallow goo from their brows, the Ghostbusters are applauded by the city\'s population.'] ['Prior to Christmas break, a young woman Emily Blunt  accepts the idea from a cell phone texting session to use the campus "Ride Share" program as an alternative to riding the bus back home to Delaware. Finding a posting on a bulletin board, she catches a ride home from a stranger, Ashton Holmes . She arrives late to her ride, finding guy sleeping in his car, an old American sedan. As he pops the trunk of the car for her couple suitcases, his trunk is revealed to be overloaded with his personal belongings. He explains that he has just been "kicked out of my apartment." While he warms up the car, she rearranges his trunk to find room for her suitcase. To make room, she pulls out a random bag of his stuff from the trunk and as they drive away, the over-sized shopping bag is seen sitting in the empty parking lot. The girl\'s anti-social behavior is made clear as she selfishly carries on a cell phone conversation. Finally noticing the pained look on her driver\'s face, she hangs up her phone. He explains to her the "rules" of ride sharing, they share half the expenses and it\'s her responsibility to keep up a conversation while they drive. The conversation is very stilted between mismatched pair: the anti-social, loner chick and the square Catholic High School graduate driver who is majoring philosophy. Guy reveals they shared a class together. Girl says it was a huge class and she never noticed him. Guy asks about her glasses, "Did you have Lasik surgery?" Girl is surprised that he knows about her glasses since she only wears them in her dorm room. An awkward pause is filled with the guy changing the subject. As she paints her toenails, ignoring him, they drive alone the open highway. An on screen clock shows they have been on the road for a couple of hours. She asks him to keep an eye out for a gas station, saying she needs a bathroom break. At the filling station, she doesn\'t want to get out of the car because the polish on her nails hasn\'t yet dried. He offers to carry her into the station, which, despite her protests, he does. While the guy talks to the attendant, Darren Moore, the girl finds the bathroom, which is dirty and in poor repair. After doing her business, she washes her hands only to discover the blow dryer doesn\'t work. After wiping her hand on her pants, she finds she cannot open the bathroom door. It is apparently locked. She begins pounding on the door for help, and though she had walked past several people in the diner section of the filling station, no one comes to help her. Eventually, she frees herself . She finds the guy still chatting up the clerk behind the counter. She is furious that he didn\'t come to her aid. He assures her they didn\'t hear her cries for help, though she says she could hear them talking. As they leave the filling station, the guy verifies his directions with the clerk, as if he is lost and doesn\'t know where he is going. The girl calls him on it, but he assures her he is not lost. Soon after they resume their trip, he takes a side road listed as Route 606. The snow covered road is reduced to one lane and his older car slips and slides on the packed snow. Despite her protests that they immediately turn back to the freeway, he continues saying "this is a shortcut and we will be back on the freeway in no time." As night falls, an on-coming car approaches them at high speed in a game of chicken. They swerve to avoid it, colliding into a snow bank. A radio news report warns that an incoming storm will bring snow and temperatures down to 30 degrees below zero. As they fight the falling temperatures, they begin to see people outside of their car, from ghostly priests to other manifestations of lost souls. Before they understand that they are spirits, the girl tries to touch one. Her hand is burned. The spirit turns to show that he, too, is a victim of fire. Bit by bit, details come out of the guy\'s longing for her. How he had texted her the suggestion to use the Ride Share program and posted his number for her to find. How he took the scenic route in hopes of creating a romantic memory. It also comes out that the bag she left behind was a bag of food he had bought for their trip. They think help has arrived when a Pennsylvania Highway Patrol Officer, Martin Donovan, knocks on their window. Oddly, he doesn\'t seem to understand their predicament, choosing instead to believe they were parking. Taking the girl from the car, he tries to get her into the back of his car. When it becomes clear to her that he means her harm, she struggles to get away, but cannot. The guy appears behind the officer, welding a tire iron, and beats him across the head, rescuing her. The highway patrol officer was a spirit and the most menacing one of them all. The spirits turn out to be spectres remaining who were victims of the rogue cop who would lure his victims to this deserted stretch of road and kill them, including four monks who witnessed his crimes. They learn of it from an article in a newspaper they are using for insulation against a car window. As the night progresses, during occasional fitful naps, the crimes of the rogue cop are re-enacted with the girl as part of them. As the night progresses, it is revealed that the guy has sustained greater injuries from the accident than he had let on. In a desperate attempt to get help, the girl comes up with the idea of climbing a nearby telephone pole, tapping into the line with the phone from the guy\'s household belongings, and calling for help. While it is unclear if she is 100% successful , she does make her call and returns to the car to find her traveling companion has died. Defeat settles in as she tries to figure out what to do. For reasons that are not made clear, she pulls him from the car. Perhaps she is planning on dragging him to help, when a pair of headlights show up. It is a tow truck operator, Ned Bellamy, responding to her 911 call. He loads the body of her dead friend into the back of his cab and they begin driving to safety. The tow truck driver fills in the blanks about the story of how people have been dying along that particular stretch of road since the 50\'s when the rogue cop was killing them. But even after he was killed, the string of deaths continued, including people inexplicably freezing to death in the cars. It\'s clear this girl has narrowly escaped a very close call with death when the same car that chased her and her traveling companion off the narrow road in the first place shows up again, this time driving the tow truck driver off the road, too. After the tow truck rolls and crashes, the girl and its driver are shaken up, but still alive. The tow truck driver insists on seeing about the other driver. At the bottom of a ravine, he sees a burning wreck. It is clearly the burning wreckage from the 50\'s of the rogue cop car. As the tow driver shimmies down into the ravine, the girl chases him, yelling for him to stop. The rogue cop is pinned inside his upside down car which is on fire. The priests show up, but rather than pull him from the wreckage, they pull the microphone for his radio from his car, preventing him from calling for help. The car becomes engulfed in flames. The rogue cop crawls out of the burning wreckage, attacking the stunned tow truck driver. As the spirit of the cop touches the tow truck driver, he instantly freezes. The girl scrambles away, back into the damaged tow truck, attempting to start it and failing while the spirit cop reaches her and tries to attack her. That\'s when the spirit of her Ride Share driver appears, once more defeating the rogue cop\'s spirit. The girl climbs from the car, seeing the ghost of driver standing in the woods. He apologizes and says he would have explained everything to her if they had had more time. She accepts his good intentions and then follows him through the woods. They pass through the cabin where the priests/monks once lived  and various other signs of the carnage created through the years by the rogue cop until they eventually reach the service station where they had stopped hours ago for fuel and a bathroom break.'] ['Part of a secret government eugenics project, crazed biochemistry professor John Saxon committed terrible crimes on his college campus in the late 1960s before one of his colleagues burned the college to put a deadly end to his spree.

In the middle of the line of cars, a lone bright red and white Fury stands in contrast to the others. The Plymouth\'s malevolent character is established when one worker is injured when the car\'s hood slams shut on his hand while working on the car, and another is apparently choked to death inside after dropping some cigar ash on to one of the seats. 21 years later, in 1978, Arnold "Arnie" Cunningham  is a nerdy teen boy with only one friend, a childhood companion and popular jock named Dennis Guilder ([[John Stockwell . Arnie\'s life begins to change when he gets a confrontation from the school bully Buddy Repperton  who threatens Arnie with a switchblade and gets expelled. Arnie\'s life also begins to change when he buys the rusty red-white Fury from crusty bachelor George LeBay  for $250, even though the vehicle is in serious need of repair. Dennis fruitlessly attempts to dissuade Arnie from purchasing the car , pointing out that the odometer reads over 93,000 miles, which Dennis surmises is likely half the actual total. Enamored, Arnie ignores his friend and hastily writes LeBay a check, and he proceeds to drive home with Dennis following in his blue 1968 Dodge Charger. After his parents refuse to let Arnie park Christine in the family\'s driveway for not informing them that he is going to buy a car, he is forced to store her at a local garage, run by the grouchy Will Darnell . As Arnie begins to restore Christine to her original beauty, Arnie sits behind the wheel and the radio which only seems to play 1950s era rock and roll, begins playing the Johnny Ace song "Pledging My Love", assuring Arnie that his feelings of admiration for Christine are requited. Those in his life notice changes in his attitude and appearance with the more time he spends with the car. Initially shy and timid, Arnie develops a cocky arrogance and has taken on a bit of a sinister appearance; he no longer wears his thick glasses and begins dressing in all black clothing. Dennis\'s concern for his friend deepens when he is informed by George LeBay that Roland\'s  wife died in Christine of carbon monoxide poisoning. George LeBay also reveals that Rolands\'s young daughter had been killed in the car. During a football game, Dennis spies a newly restored Christine and is shocked to see Arnie with Leigh Cabot . The distraction causes him to be hit while leaping for a pass and he is seriously injured by another player, placing him in the hospital. After Buddy sees Arnie in Christine at Dennis\'s football game, he is extremly jealous. The gang follows Arnie back to Will\'s garage, where they severely vandalize and crush the newly restored Christine at night , leaving her totally ruined. Arnie sees the wreck of Christine the next day and is shocked that all the work he put into restoring the car has been destroyed. Although his parents want to buy him a new car as he has become obsessed, Arnie is determined to restore the car again. The next day, as he looks the wreck over, he turns his back and hears metal creaking behind him; he turns and sees that Christine\'s engine is fully restored. Stepping away, Arnie smiles and says, "Okay...show me." Christine\'s headlights flicker on, and she then comes to life and fully restores herself to mint condition. The next night, Christine chases and kills Moochie, a member of Buddy\'s gang, by crushing him against a wall. A few days later at school, Arnie receives a visit from Detective Rudolph Junkins  who suspects that Arnie killed Moochie in a fit of revenge against those who vandalized Christine. However, he is unable to produce adequate proof because even though Christine is badly damaged in the attack on Moochie, she regenerated herself to showroom quality afterward. Christine then seeks out and gruesomely kills individual members of the gang who destroyed her, one by one. The spree climaxes when Christine confronts the last three remaining members of the gang, Don Vandenberg , Richie Trelawney  and Buddy himself, at a service station. Christine pushes Buddy\'s grey 1967 Chevrolet Camaro into Richie, who has sought refuge inside the garage, and its fuel tank ruptures in the collision and gasoline spills onto the floor. Buddy\'s Camaro catches fire which quickly ignites the fuel on the floor, setting the building ablaze and killing Don. Terrified, Buddy flees the station on foot and as a burning Christine gives chase, she runs over the station\'s gas pumps, causing the building to explode. In one of the film\'s more memorable sequences, Christine, still in flames, chases Buddy down and runs him over leaving his burning corpse on the road. After the attacks, Christine returns to the garage and subsequently kills Will Darnell by crushing him against the steering wheel, asphyxiating him. After an incident in which Arnie\'s girlfriend Leigh is almost choked to death by Christine at a drive-in theater, she beseeches Dennis for help. Leigh and Dennis resolve to try and save Arnie, unaware that Christine is unwilling to give up Arnie without a fight. On New Year\'s Eve Dennis and Leigh reason that the only way to stop Christine and save Arnie is to destroy the car. Dennis then says that he is going to Arnie\'s, and Leigh urges him to be careful. After she leaves, Arnie pulls up to Dennis\'s house in Christine, picks him up, and the pair drive off. During the ride to Arnie\'s house, Arnie displays erratic and reckless behavior , and tells Dennis about how strong the bond is between Christine and him. During the ride, Dennis sees that the odometer now reads less than 58,000 miles and is still rolling backward. The next day, Dennis goes to the school parking lot and scratches "Darnell\'s Tonight" into Christine\'s hood, and drives off with Leigh. The pair go to Darnell\'s where they wait in a bulldozer. Dennis tells Leigh to wait in the office so she can shut the door after Christine arrives, trapping the vehicle. When Leigh exits the bulldozer and heads for the office, Christine\'s headlights suddenly blaze out of the darkness from under a pile of garbage, and the car charges at Leigh. As Christine crashes into Darnell\'s office in an attempt to kill Leigh, Arnie is ejected through Christine\'s windshield and is impaled on a shard of glass, fatally wounding him. He survives just long enough to admire Christine one last time and lovingly caress her front bumper. Enraged, Christine proceeds to attack Leigh. Dennis counters in the bulldozer and he proceeds to fight Christine, who is playing "Pledging My Love" at top volume on her radio. As she is launching her final assault on Leigh, Dennis drives the bulldozer up on to the car\'s back, stopping her and apparently killing her. Leigh climbs into the cab and she and Dennis embrace, but Christine springs back to life and again begins to heal herself. Dennis then finishes driving over her with the bulldozer, and her headlights flicker and then go out for good. The scene cuts immediately to the next day; Dennis and Leigh are seen along with Detective Junkins at a wrecking yard, where Christine has been crushed into a cube by a metal compactor, apparently finally destroying her. Leigh and Dennis lament that they were unable to save Arnie and as they reflect on the events, loud 1950s rock music begins to play. Startled, Leigh and Dennis look up and see a worker in a hard hat playing the music on a boombox as he walks into view from behind some other wrecked cars. Leigh exclaims "God, I hate rock and roll." The film ends with the camera zooming in on the crushed cube that was formerly Christine and a piece of the grill slowly begins to bend, ever so slightly, indicating that maybe the car isn\'t "dead" after all....'] ['The film opens at Mercy Falls, an English children\'s hospital which is closing down. Only eight patients remain, waiting to be transferred. One of the patients, Maggie, whom we later learn is an orphan suffering from cystic fibrosis, tells the night nurse, Susan, that she has seen "her" again. An annoyed Susan tells Maggie to return to bed. Just then, Simon, another patient, shrieks in pain as his leg is broken. Susan and Dr. Robert cannot find a reason for this, though, since the child was found lying in bed. Just as a second x-ray of the leg is being taken, Simon\'s leg is broken again. Susan quits the job, frightened by all she has seen. Amy Nicholls, an American nurse, arrives at the hospital to replace Susan. Amy learns that the elevator no longer goes up to the second floor, a ward that has not been used since 1959. Her colleague Helen Perez introduces her to the eight children. Maggie tells her about a ghost who haunts the hospital named Charlotte, whom she calls "the mechanical girl", and communicates through some toy blocks. Strange things occur throughout Amy\'s first night at Mercy Falls, but she tries to remain calm, and asks Roy, the caretaker, about Charlotte. Roy mentions that other children throughout the years have mentioned the ghost as well. The next day, Amy and young Simon get stuck in the elevator, which takes them up to the second floor. After a bit of a struggle, Roy manages to help them out. A startled Amy begins to ask more questions about the second floor. She mentions it to Mrs. Folder, the hospital\'s director, but is told to forget about it. Amy decides to ask Maggie about Charlotte again. Strange things continue happening throughout the night, and Amy decides to dig deeper into this mystery. Amy visits Susan\'s home to ask her if she knew anything, but learns from a priest at the house that Susan had died the day before in a car accident. The priest mentions that he\'d noticed something troubling Susan and that she\'d sought help from two women. Amy visits them and learns more about the afterlife. The women tell her that ghosts stay close to what they love and that the living world and the afterlife are separate. They tell her only those close to death can glimpse ghosts. They believe there is an evil presence in the hospital and warn Amy. Back at Mercy Falls, the children watch Sleeping Beauty, and Amy tells Helen and Mrs. Folder about Susan\'s death. After the movie, Amy and Maggie talk about love and kisses. Amy asks Roy to show her the files of the other children who\'d mentioned Charlotte. Later that day, when Roy tries to pack the dice  he is attacked by something and is killed. Amy decides to go up to the second floor, through a ceiling door that she is shown by Maggie. There, she finds an old photograph which shows a girl in a wheelchair posing with a nurse, and a film-reel which shows this girl at a medical treatment of osteogenesis imperfecta. On the back of the photograph is written "Charlotte and Mandy, 1959." Amy is startled when she thinks she sees the mechanical girl and rushes out of the second floor. Using Roy\'s projector, she and Dr. Robert view the film. Robert tells her the disease Charlotte suffered from was very painful, a sickness that causes the patient\'s bones to be very, very susceptible to fractures. The treatment for it  was primitive and barbaric. Doctors had built a metal frame for Charlotte to wear, a mechanical frame that was connected to tubes implanted throughout the child\'s body. Amy now believes Charlotte is the angry and uncontrollable ghost of the little girl. She warns Helen and Robert to get the children ready to leave and goes to find help. She finds Mrs. Folder, who calls for help and drives Amy back to the hospital. Folder tells her that she is wrong - Charlotte wasn\'t the name of the little girl in the photo, but the name of the nurse. The nurse had become obsessed with Mandy, the osteogenesis sufferer. She\'d begun to purposely break the girl\'s bones and eventually murdered the child. She then put on the child\'s frame and jumped into the elevator shaft, killing herself. Amy realizes that what Charlotte wants is the children, that is why she still remains in the hospital. Amy knows the ghost will not let the children leave without hurting them. She arrives at the hospital, which is now falling apart because of Charlotte\'s rage, and, with the help of the rest of the adults, keeps the children inside, preventing Charlotte from becoming angrier. As help arrives, Amy realizes that everything is suddenly calm, and Mrs. Folder says that Maggie is missing. Amy goes up to the second floor to save Maggie from Charlotte and gets badly hurt in the process. The two make it back down to the first floor. Charlotte stands there with an angry expression, satisfied that she has hurt Maggie and Amy. Maggie dies in Amy\'s arms soon after. Amy tells Robert that she\'s meant to die too, since she saw the ghost. Amy is saved at the last minute, though, after receiving a love kiss from Maggie\'s ghost. The movie ends with Amy waking up in a different, significantly less haunted hospital and an elderly dying man seeing Maggie\'s ghost sitting by Amy\'s bedside.'] ["{{plot}} The film focuses on Laura Porter , who as a child witnessed both her parents being brutally murdered by a hooded man, along with her brother Henry ([[Matt Cohen .

Their plan works with two of the girls but the third, Mary Banner , tries to escape. The football captain chases her into a storage room and punches her, knocking her out. He panics and locks her body in a trunk, thinking she is dead. She wakes up later locked in the trunk, eventually dying inside it. Thirty-five years later, this story is told among three school girls during a sleep over. One of them, Samantha , had written an article in the school paper critical of football players\' academic achievements and subsequently she, her friends and her brother David  are treated as outcasts by the rest of the school. They also jokingly conjure up Bloody Mary and in the next morning all three are gone. After having been missing for one day, they reappear, waking up in an old deserted mill, with no knowledge of how they got there. While most suspect a hoax on the girls\' part, Samantha and David suspects that it is some prank by football players. While Samantha is haunted by visions of a dead girl bleeding from her head, several pupils die under mysterious circumstances resembling urban legends; for example, football player Roger  burns in a sunbed, Heather , girlfriend to football captain Buck , has spiders erupting from a swelling on her cheek, driving her to cut her face with a mirror, and football player, Tom , is electrocuted while urinating on an old electrical fence, his ring finger being bitten or cut off. Buck blames these deaths on the Owens siblings. Before her death, Heather made up with Samantha and tried to tell her that this happened before. In her homework, Samantha finds notes sent to Heather about the disappearance of Mary Banner and the homecoming kidnappings of 1969, as well as notes referencing the events of the previous films. Browsing the school paper\'s archives, they find out that Mary was never found, that another victim committed suicide years later and that the third, Grace Taylor , still lives in town. They visit Grace, who claims that Mary, or rather, her "life force", is exacting revenge on the children of the five people involved in the kidnappings but cannot  reveal the names of the perpetrators. While Samantha is prone to believe her, David remains sceptical and thinks that Grace is more likely the killer. While sneaking around in Grace\'s house, he also found out that Grace produced or collected artwork on Urban Legend and identifies Grace as the originator of the notes sent to Heather. The siblings go to warn Buck, who admits that he and his mates orchestrated Samantha\'s disappearance and blames her for the death of this friends. He also reveals that his father, the football coach, was one of the kidnappers in 1969 but didn\'t hurt Mary. Samantha however suspects that the coach was the one that killed Mary as she saw him put flowers on her headstone earlier. Her stepfather, who overheard her, tells her to reveal any solid evidence she has. Meanwhile, an upset Buck tries to relax by drinking and watching movie in a motel. Falling asleep, he wakes up from hearing a dripping sound and discovers the corpse of his dog. He is attacked by Mary, who crawls out from under his bed and kills him with his broken bottle. Different rumours about his death immediately spring up. Both siblings are trying to find clues about the fifth remaining perpetrator, Samantha by browsing through old photographs, David by visiting Grace again. Grace still refuses to reveal the names but directs him to the school archives. Going through the archives, he suddenly finds out the identity of the fifth person and rushes home, but finds Sam gone and is suffocated by a hooded man. Samantha meanwhile has visions of Mary again, revealing that the girl was not dead when being locked in the trunk and also her whereabouts. She also visits Grace, who tells her to find and bury Mary\'s corpse and reluctantly agrees to drive Samantha to the school. While Grace is waiting in the van, Samantha finds the storage room and the trunk with Mary\'s corpse in it. The hooded man also appears and enters the storage room but Samantha locks him inside while carrying Mary\'s remains outside to the van. Finding Grace asleep, Samantha drives the van to the cemetery, where she begins to dig a grave for Mary under her headstone. Her stepfather, whom Samantha had phoned, also appears and helps her digging but suddenly hits her with the shovel. Pursuing his stepdaughter through the graveyard, Mr. Owens  reveals that he was the one that locked Mary in the trunk and that he also killed his stepson, David. He finally captured her and is about to decapitate her when Mary, in her living form, appears. Smiling towards Samantha, she kisses him, then reverts back to her ghastly form and drags him with her into the grave. When Samantha wakes up, the grave is surrounded by police and medical personnel retrieving her stepfather\'s corpse.

Anton Gorodetsky, the protagonist of the first film, finds himself in the middle of an approaching conflict between the Light and Dark Others, who are still bound with an uneasy truce. Anton is still a Night Watch operative, now working with his trainee and romantic interest, Svetlana. As his son Yegor has now become a Dark Other, Anton is forced to secretly destroy evidence of Yegor\'s attacks on normal people, which violates the treaty, leaving the Night Watch unable to sentence Yegor. To redeem for his previous mistake, an attempt to use a witch\'s service to kill the unborn Yegor , Anton seeks the legendary Chalk of Fate, a magical chalk that could rewrite history, which was once Tamerlane\'s property and one of the main reasons for his numerous military successes. Meanwhile, Zavulon, the leader of the Dark Others and their Day Watch, is waiting for Yegor\'s birthday. At the birthday, Yegor would become a Great Other and acquire the power that would allow the Dark Others to break the treaty . Zavulon\'s gratitude to Anton for covering Yegor\'s violations of the treaty doesn\'t stop him and the Day Watch from attempting to frame Anton for murder and bring him in front of the Inquisition. They succeed, despite the efforts made by Geser, the head of the Night Watch, to protect Anton from the Dark Others by putting him in Olga\'s body. While in her body, Svetlana confesses that she loves Anton to the person she thinks is Olga, which pushes their relationship forward. This happens despite Svetlana\'s initial anger at Anton for not telling her that he was in Olga\'s body. Anton obtains the Chalk of Fate from its hiding place in a Central Asian cafe in Moscow and uses it to summon Yegor. They initially get on well, but Yegor is resentful when Anton refuses his request to patch things up with Yegor\'s mother. Anton puts his large coat on Yegor, who seems to be cold, and leaves to order food. At this time, Svetlana rings Anton\'s mobile, which he left in the pocket of the coat, and Yegor, angry at her intrusion into his relationship with his absentee father, yells at her, "He has a family. Don\'t call again." He smashes the phone and leaves with the chalk, which he takes to Zavulon. Zavulon cannot use or even touch the Chalk, because doing so would be a direct violation of the treaty, so he has Yegor give it to his minion/lover Alisia to do with as she wishes, although it is implied that Zavulon knows what she will do with it. Yegor\'s birthday party begins soon after that; the guests are Dark Others , although Anton makes his way to the party as Yegor\'s father to expose the real perpetrator of the murder he has been charged with - his vampire neighbor, Kostya\'s father. He is unable, however, to avert a disaster: as Svetlana rushes to the party to find Anton, Yegor confronts her. She tries to avoid a conflict but Yegor repeatedly challenges her and expresses resentment at her relationship with his father; Svetlana accidentally strikes Yegor and spills a drop of his blood, which Zavulon interprets as a violation of the Treaty and thus uses as a pretense to declare all-out war on the Light Others. Yegor, now a Great Other, unleashes an apocalypse upon Moscow, killing most of the guests and blinding Svetlana. The city is nearly destroyed, starting with the Ostankino Tower; a fierce battle between the Light and Dark Others follows, with few survivors on either side. In the midst of the chaos, Anton, who survives, finds Alisia who is trying to revive her dead lover, Kostya, but without success. She cannot revive him because her actions did not cause his death. The scene implies the user of the Chalk can only change decisions that he or she made, not anyone else\'s. Anton convinces Alisia to give him the Chalk so that he can prevent the destruction of Moscow and the deaths of scores of Others, but is almost immediately caught by a panicked Svetlana and an enraged Yegor. The two Great Others fight for Anton, but nearly kill him in the process. Saved at the last minute by Geser, Anton runs through the ruins of Moscow to the house where he, fourteen years ago, made his visit to the witch &mdash; the visit that caused the entire sequence of events, starting Anton\'s own initiation into the Night Watch. Anton writes NO  on a wall in this house. Moscow reverts to its normal, undemolished state and the film returns to 1992 and the first scene of Night Watch. In the epilogue, as a result of the Chalk\'s influence, Anton rethinks his deal with the witch, and therefore never inadvertently agrees to harm his wife\'s unborn child, who would have been Yegor. He walks out of the house and into the street, where he meets Svetlana. Zavulon and Geser watch them from a park bench, eager to see if Anton will recognize Svetlana, despite now having never met her because of the rewriting of history. Geser\'s prediction turns out to be accurate; despite not knowing how or why, Anton recognizes Svetlana and they walk off together, implicitly striking up a less harried relationship than the one they have/had in the first film.'] ['Helen Lyle is a graduate student conducting research for her thesis on urban legends. While interviewing freshmen about their superstitions, she hears about a local legend known as Candyman. The legend contains many thematic elements similar to the most well known urban legends, including endangered babysitters, spirits who appear in mirrors when fatally summoned, and maniac killers with unnatural deformities.W. Scott Poole, Monsters in America: Our Historical Obsession with the Hideous and the Haunting , 53-54. The legend claims that Candyman can be summoned by looking into a mirror and saying his name five times (similar to the [[Bloody Mary , whereupon he will murder the summoner with his hook-hand. Later that evening, Helen and her friend Bernadette jokingly call Candyman\'s name into the mirror in Helen\'s bathroom but nothing happens. Discussing the legend with fellow academics, she uncovers an origin story. Candyman was the son of a slave, who became a well known artist. After falling in love with a white woman who became pregnant, he was set upon by a lynch mob, who cut off his painting hand and replaced with a hook. He was smeared with honey  from a nearby apiary, and the bees stung him to death. With her colleague Bernadette, Helen enters the notorious gang-ridden Cabrini–Green housing project, the site of a recent unsolved murder linked to Candyman. There she meets Anne-Marie McCoy, one of the residents, as well as a young boy named Jake, who tells her a disturbing story of a child who was castrated in a public restroom near the projects, supposedly by Candyman. While Helen explores the run-down restroom, a gang member attacks her: he carries a hook, and has taken the Candyman moniker as his own to enhance his own "street cred" by associating himself with the legend. Helen survives the assault and is able to later identify her attacker to the police. Helen later returns to school but hears a voice calling her name as she walks to her car. The apparent real Candyman now appears and explains that since Helen has been telling people in Cabrini-Green he is just a legend, he must again prove he exists. Helen blacks out and wakes up in Anne-Marie\'s apartment, covered in blood. Anne-Marie, whose Rottweiler has been decapitated and whose baby is also missing, attacks Helen and she is forced to defend herself from Anne-Marie using a meat cleaver. The police then enter the apartment and arrest Helen. Trevor, Helen\'s husband, bails her out of jail the following day, but while he is out of the apartment, Candyman appears to Helen again and cuts her neck, causing her to bleed unconscious. Bernadette then arrives at then apartment and Candyman murders her. The police are called and Helen is sedated and is placed in a psychiatric hospital pending trial. After a month\'s stay at the hospital, Helen is interviewed by a psychologist in preparation for her upcoming trial. While restrained, Helen attempts to convince the psychologist that the urban legend is indeed true by calling Candyman. Candyman appears, murdering the psychologist, and Helen is able to escape. She briefly confronts Trevor but he is now living with one of his students. Helen then flees to Cabrini–Green to confront Candyman and to locate Anne-Marie\'s still-missing infant. In an apartment\'s attic, she encounters the words "It was you all along, Helen." Candyman predicts that Helen will help carry on his tradition of inciting fear into a community, and promises to release the baby if Helen agrees to sacrifice herself. Instead of holding his end of the bargain, Candyman takes both the baby and Helen into the middle of a massive junk pile which the residents have been planning to turn into a bonfire, intending to sacrifice both Helen and the baby in order to feed his own legend. However, the residents believe Candyman is hiding inside the bonfire pile and set it aflame. Helen manages to rescue the baby, but dies from burns in the process. Candyman also burns in the fire, leaving only his hook-hand behind. After Helen\'s funeral, in which the residents of Cabrini–Green pay their respects to Helen, Trevor stands before a mirror in the bathroom of their former apartment. He chants Helen\'s name in grief, summoning her vengeful spirit. Helen kills Trevor with Candyman\'s hook, leaving Trevor\'s new lover Stacey with his bloodied corpse as Helen becomes the embodiment of the urban legend. The film ends as the credits roll over a painting of Helen with her hair ablaze on a wall in Cabrini-Green, showing that she has now entered folklore.'] ['Eleanor “Nell” Vance  has cared for her invalid mother for 11 years.

The hotel itself is built on the site of a Native American burial ground and becomes completely snowed in during the long winters. Manager Stuart Ullman  warns him that a previous caretaker developed cabin fever and killed his family and himself. Jack\'s son, Danny , has ESP and has had a terrifying premonition about the hotel. Jack\'s wife, Wendy , tells a visiting doctor that Danny has an imaginary friend called Tony and that Jack has given up drinking because he had hurt Danny\'s arm after a binge. The family arrives at the hotel on closing day and is given a tour. The African-AmericanHallorann\'s race is of much greater significance in King\'s novel IT than in this story, although in the film the ghost butler and Jack Torrance refer to Hallorann using racial slurs . African-Americans with supernatural powers are a recurring motif in King\'s novels. chef Dick Hallorann  surprises Danny by telepathically offering him ice cream. He explains to Danny that he and his grandmother shared this telepathic ability, which he calls "shining". Danny asks if there is anything to be afraid of in the hotel, particularly Room 237. Hallorann tells Danny that the hotel itself has a "shine" to it along with many memories, not all of which are good. He also tells Danny to stay out of Room 237. A month passes; while Jack\'s writing project goes nowhere, Danny and Wendy explore the hotel\'s hedge maze. Wendy becomes concerned about the phone lines being out due to the heavy snowfall and Danny has more frightening visions. Jack, increasingly frustrated, starts acting strangely and becomes prone to violent outbursts. Danny\'s curiosity about Room 237 gets the better of him when he sees the room\'s door open. Later, he shows up injured and visibly traumatized, causing Wendy to accuse Jack of abusing Danny. Jack wanders into the hotel\'s Gold Room where he meets a ghostly bartender named Lloyd . Lloyd serves him bourbon on the rocks while Jack complains to him about his marriage. Wendy later tells Jack that Danny told her that a "crazy woman in one of the rooms" was responsible for his injuries. Jack investigates Room 237 where he encounters the ghost of a dead woman, but tells Wendy he saw nothing. Wendy and Jack argue about whether Danny should be removed from the hotel and a furious Jack returns to the Gold Room, now filled with ghosts having a costume party. Here, he meets the ghost of the previous caretaker, Grady , who tells Jack that he must "correct" his wife and child. Meanwhile, in Florida, Hallorann has a premonition that something is wrong at the hotel and takes a flight back to Colorado to investigate. Danny starts calling out "redrum" frantically and goes into a trance, now referring to himself as "Tony".{{anchor}} While searching for Jack, Wendy discovers his typewriter; he has been typing endless pages of manuscript repeating "all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy" formatted in various styles. She is confronted by Jack, who threatens her before she knocks him unconscious with a baseball bat. She manages to drag him into the kitchen and lock him in the pantry, but this does not solve her larger problem; she and Danny are trapped at the hotel since Jack has sabotaged the hotel\'s two-way radio and snowcat. Later, Jack converses through the pantry door with Grady, who then unlocks the door, releasing him. Danny writes "REⱭЯUM" in lipstick on the bathroom door. When Wendy sees this in the bedroom mirror, the letters spell out "MURDƎЯ".In both forwards and backwards orientations, two of the six letters are displayed backwards, the middle DR for REDRUM and the final ER for MURDER. Jack begins to chop through the door leading to his family\'s living quarters with a fire axe. Wendy frantically sends Danny out through the bathroom window, but can\'t get through it herself. Jack then starts chopping through the bathroom door as Wendy screams in horror; he leers through the hole he has made, shouting "Here\'s Johnny!", but backs off after Wendy slashes his hand with a butcher knife. Hearing the engine of the snowcat Hallorann has borrowed to get up the mountain, Jack leaves the room. He kills Hallorann in the lobby and pursues Danny into the hedge maze. Wendy runs through the hotel looking for Danny, encountering several ghosts and a huge cascade of blood from an elevator. Meanwhile, Danny walks backwards in his own tracks and leaps behind a corner, covering his tracks with snow to mislead Jack, who is following his footprints. Wendy and Danny escape in Hallorann\'s snowcat, while Jack freezes to death in the hedge maze. In a photograph in the hotel hallway dated July 4, 1921, Jack Torrance smiles amid a crowd of party revelers.'] ['{{Plot}} The Leprechaun is on a desolate planet attempting to court a narcissistic princess named Zarina, whom he has kidnapped in a plot to marry her, then murder her father in order to become king of her home planet, Dominia. A group of space marines attack and the Leprechaun kills one of the marines, Lucky, with a lightsaber-like weapon. When another marine, Kowalski, throws a grenade and it lands near Zarina, the Leprechaun jumps in the way, and, though Zarina is saved, the explosion of the bomb kills the Leprechaun and causes Zarina to lose a hand. While the rest of the crew attend to Zarina, Kowalski relieves himself on the Leprechaun\'s dismembered leg, and is seemingly possessed. The marines return to their ship with Zarina, where their leader, the half-robotic Dr. Mittenhand, explains that the princess has regenerative powers  and his plans to use Zarina\'s DNA to recreate his own mutilated body. Elsewhere on the ship, the Leprechaun violently emerges from Kowalski\'s penis when he attempts to have sex with a fellow marine, Dolores, killing him in an incredibly painful and sadistic manner. The Leprechaun then kills most of the crew members in other various gruesome and absurd ways: Mooch has his suit sliced open and dissolved into a skeleton, Danny is crushed under a metal structure, Dolores is dropped from extreme height, the leader of the marines, Metal Head, is brainwashed into thinking he is a drag queen and has his head cracked open, revealing him to be a cyborg which deactivates after being electrocuted. He finds Zarina in Dr. Mittenhand\'s laboratory, making his way in by assuming the image of a completely naked Doctor Tina Reeves, kills Mittenhand\'s assistant Harold by stabbing him in the groin and then flattening his face, and injects doctor Mittenhand with a mixture of his intended bride\'s DNA and the remains of a scorpion and a tarantula , before initiating the ship\'s self-destruct mechanism. A surviving marine, Sticks, rushes to the bridge to defuse the self-destruct but he is stopped by a password prompt. The other survivors, Sergeant Books Malloy and Tina, confront the Leprechaun in the cargo bay, who grows to many times his own size after being exposed to Dr. Mittenhand\'s experimental enlargement ray. Tina crawls through the air ducts, where her red pants get torn off by Dr. Mittenhand. Tina spends the remainder of the film in a T-shirt and black panties. Sticks is attacked and tangled in webs by the now mutated and deformed Dr. Mittenhand, now known as Mittenspider, who has taken the shape of a giant spider-like creature. Tina sprays Mittenspider with liquid nitrogen from a hose and then shoots him, shattering his body. Books avoids the giant Leprechaun and opens the airlock so the villain is sucked out into space and explodes while Zarina watches in glee. Books joins the others at the helm, and they discover that the password is "Wizard," since Dr. Mittenhand previously referred to himself as "the wizard behind the curtain," stopping the self-destruct with only seconds to spare. The three rejoice and Books and Tina kiss as the spaceship flies past the remains of the giant Leprechaun\'s body. They fly past his fist, clenched with middle finger extended.'] ['The film begins during the Blitz in London in 1940. An elderly and very unwell Dr. John Watson  tells his nurse the tale of his most complex adventure with Sherlock Holmes , which he and Holmes vowed never to tell the public or adapt into one of Watson\'s famous journals. Several incidents in 1882 lead to the consulting-detective Sherlock Holmes investigating with aid from his companion, Dr. Watson . They investigate a ship carrying gold which was destroyed by a mythical giant octopus on the coast of Newhaven. They do not believe the first-hand accounts of the sole survivor of the attack , but nonetheless investigate. When investigating the remains of the ship on the coast, Holmes is told by Inspector Lestrade that he has recently had contact with his estranged brother Thorpe. In Whitechapel, a young man is killed by a small Tyrannosaurus rex. Watson doesn\'t believe the article about the monster until he and Holmes are on a walk in some woods, and the dinosaur appears and pursues them. Finding escape, they come across several more clues that make Holmes believe the monsters are artificial, built by a criminal genius. On the case, the dinosaur steals a water pump operating a fountain and much copper wire, raising questions as to what the creature\'s inventor is trying to achieve. The octopus that destroyed the ship earlier is linked to the dinosaur because they are both similarly "exceptionally improbable". Lestrade is also investigating the crimes and stalks Holmes and Watson on their mission to solve the mysteries. On one of their leads, Lestrade ends up missing. Holmes\'s astounding logic leads himself and Watson to an old castle in Helmsmouth he and his brother visited as children. They come across another monster, a masked mechanical man: Spring-Heeled Jack. The person under the mask is revealed to be Holmes\' brother, Thorpe. Miss Ivory, his accomplice, is with him. Thorpe explains that the crimes were committed to make an armory that would keep him alive from the bullet wedged in his spine. All the tools his monsters stole -- the gold, the water pump, the copper wire -- all contributed to the creation of his cybernetic suit. He plans to destroy London and force Lestrade, who he believes shot him years ago, to claim responsibility. Holmes tries to attack Thorpe, only to be shot and presumably killed by Miss Ivory. Miss Ivory is revealed to be one of Thorpe\'s robotic creations , and Thorpe has placed a bomb in her workings that will detonate when she reaches Buckingham Palace, home of Queen Victoria, while Thorpe pilots his most complex invention yet, a fire-breathing dragon in which he pilots and holds Lestrade hostage. Holmes returns, having survived the gunshot as his tobacco box in his pocket stopped the bullet. Watson is sent to stop Miss Ivory from assassinating the Queen, while Holmes pilots another one of Thorpe\'s inventions, a hot-air balloon driven by helicopter propellers and armed with guns, in an attempt to stop his brother. Thorpe sets fire to Parliament and Westminster Abbey in his battle with his brother. Ivory is deactivated by Watson moments before the explosion can take place and Thorpe\'s dragon is sent crashing in the garden outside the Palace. Thorpe crawls from the wreckage and tries to shoot Watson, before he himself is killed by Sherlock Holmes. Lestrade, as usual, takes credit for solving the case. Holmes and Watson vow never to speak of the events again, because of how it personally affected Holmes and his certainty that the world isn\'t ready. In present time, Watson dies and his nurse visits his grave. She sees Miss Ivory visiting the grave of Thorpe Holmes, questioning her thoughts that the story is false.'] ["On November 13, 1974, at 3:15am, Ronald DeFeo, Jr. shot and killed his family at their home, 112 Ocean Avenue in Amityville, New York. He killed five members of his family in their beds, but his youngest sister, Jodie, had been killed in her bedroom closet. He claimed that he was persuaded to kill them by voices he had heard in the house. George and Kathy Lutz and her three children from a previous marriage, Billy, Michael and Chelsea move into what they believe will be their dream home, 112 Ocean Avenue situated on the waterfront in Amityville. When George questions the asking price, which is well below market value, the realtor confesses the house was the scene of a brutal murder. Despite some misgivings, George acquiesces to his wife's wishes and purchases the property. Almost immediately, the family is plagued by a series of unexplained and apparently supernatural happenings. Refrigerator magnets rearrange themselves to spell out the message KATCH EM, KILL EM. Daughter Chelsea  claims that she had befriended with a girl named Jodie, the same name of one of the slaughtered DeFeo children. Chelsea also inexplicably acquires Jodie's teddy bear, with whom Jodie was buried. George frequently complains of the cold and starts spending large amounts of time in the basement, where he hears garbled voices coming from the furnace, an old television, and an unplugged clock radio reading 3:15, the time the DeFeos supposedly were killed. The locked boathouse door repeatedly is found open, blood seeps from the walls, George momentarily sees an apparition of Jodie behind Kathy as the digital clock from the basement, now by their bed, flicks from 3:14 to 3:15 am and the family dog incessantly barks at things only he can see. Babysitter Lisa is trapped in a bedroom closet that has a door with no lock yet will not open, and when she is finally released, hysterically insists she saw Jodie, who took her finger and put it inside her wound to the head. At Kathy's behest, local priest Father Callaway comes to bless the house, but is driven away when his holy water sizzles as it hits the walls and he is attacked by a swarm of flies. He later tells Kathy the battered stuffed animal Chelsea has, belonged to Jodie DeFeo and was buried with her. George's behavior becomes increasingly bizarre, and he begins to mistreat and taunt his stepchildren he once clearly adored. As the paranormal events escalate, Kathy decides to research the history of her home in the library's public records. There she discovers it once belonged to a mysterious cult preacher named Father Katchem , who tortured and killed Native Americans in the basement. Upon investigating she finds numerous bodies in the walls of the house. Kathy is convinced the man's evil spirit has taken control of her husband. By the urgent request of Father Callaway, she races home to remove her children from the house and take them to safety. Meanwhile, George has broken through the basement wall and discovered a secret chamber, where he has visions of Father Katchem and his numerous victims. Apparently possessed and no longer able to control his impulses, George chases his family with a shotgun. In a desperate struggle, George screams for Kathy to kill him, but Kathy manages to knock him out and with the help of the children binds his hands and feet and carries him to the boathouse, from which they make their escape by water. George regains consciousness and urges Kathy to get them as far away from the house as possible. A note comes below the screen, which tells viewers - how Lutz family left the house within 28 days of their stay and never came back, leaving their things behind. Jodie is seen standing in the front doorway. As she starts screaming and crying, the clocks throughout the house reset themselves to 3:15, misplaced objects go back to where they were and the girl is pulled through the hallway floor by an unknown force. The evil spirits had gone and now, the Lutz family can live in peace in a different state."] [' A scholarly dissertation on the appearances of demons and witches in primitive and medieval culture, a number of photographs of statuary, paintings, and woodcuts are used as demonstrative pieces. In addition, several large scale models are employed to demonstrate medieval concepts of the structure of the solar system and the commonly accepted depiction of Hell.  A series of vignettes theatrically demonstrating medieval superstition and beliefs concerning witchcraft, including Satan  tempting a sleeping woman away from her husband\'s bed and terrorizing a group of monks. Also shown is a woman purchasing a love potion from a supposed witch, and a sequence showing a supposed witch dreaming of flying through the air and attending a witches\' gathering.  A long narrative broken up into several parts; set in the Middle Ages, it concerns an old woman accused of witchcraft by a dying man\'s family. The narrative is used to demonstrate the treatment of suspected witches by the religious authorities of the time. The old woman, after being tortured, admits to heavy involvement in witchcraft, including detailed descriptions of a Witches\' Sabbath, even going so far as to "name" other supposed witches, including two of the women in the dying man\'s household. Eventually, the dying man\'s wife is arrested as a witch when she admits that she falsely accused the old woman of witchcraft.  The final part of the film seeks to demonstrate how the superstitions of old are better understood now. Christensen seeks to make the claim that most who were accused of witchcraft were possibly mentally ill, and in modern times, such behavior is interpreted as a disease. His case revolves around vignettes about a somnambulist and a kleptomaniac, the implication being that these behaviors would have been thought of as demonically-influenced in medieval times whereas modern times recognizes them as psychological ailments. There is heavy irony, however, in the observation that the "temperate shower of the clinic" i.e. the treatment of "hysterical women" in a modern institution, has replaced medieval solutions such as burning at the stake.'] ['Three American college students, Dick, his sister Jessica, and her British boyfriend Kevin, are traveling through Brazil on vacation when Dick, after attending a bizarre voodoo ceremony, develops strange powers. When their jeep breaks down near a small plantation in the jungle outside Rio, the site of a former slave rebellion one hundred years ago, Dick uses his powers to raise the dead of six executed Negro slaves, who target the college kids and the residents of the plantation to seek revenge for their deaths.'] ["Jack  decides to put an end to the abuse he has received from his adoptive parents, enabling him to run away and find his long lost sibling Dora. Although Dora has fared much better since their abandonment and subsequent adoption, she is also drawn to use her telepathic powers to find him. Along the way, Jack is constantly pursued by the four daughters of his adoptive parents, seeking revenge for their parents' demise at the hands of Jack and his invention."] ['During the Prohibition era, 13-year-old Lila Lee  is summoned by letter to visit her injured father, a gangster, before he dies. She runs away from the Reverend , who has raised her and in whose church she has become well known as a singer, though her extraordinary beauty is beginning to attract attention as well. She ends up taking a bus to the strange town of Astaroth, where people have the "Astaroth Look." En route, Lila is menaced in a swamp by a band of mindless vampires who haunt the woods and town. She is rescued by a mysterious woman named Lemora , who takes a fancy to her. It seems Lemora is the one who called the girl to her, though whether to protect or to corrupt her remains to be seen. Lemora takes Lila to an old house, where she bathes the girl and tries to soothe her. Exploring, Lila discovers the truth: Lemora is a vampire who feeds upon children and is holding her father captive. She is also the unofficial queen of the Astaroth vampires.  While trying to escape, Lila embarks on a nighttime journey through the town of Astaroth, learning in the process that there are two types of vampires there. The one fraction is like Lemora herself, relatively human in behavior and appearance, while the others are mutated or perhaps regressed, far more feral in behavior and monstrous in form; and the two groups are at war. Meanwhile, the Reverend, who is seeking Lila, manages to retrace her steps. After a climactic battle which leaves most of the vampires dead, Lila is forced to kill her own father, who has become one of the degenerates. As she weeps over his corpse, Lemora approaches her and offers her comfort by her vampire\'s kiss. When the Reverend shows up not long after, he finds Lila willing, even eager to kiss him. He resists at first, then he gives in. That is when she drives her fangs into his throat. The film ends showing Lila singing again in church. Whether this was intended to indicate the story was a dream, that it was a "flash forward" or that Lila returned as a vampire to the Church—or perhaps some other explanation—is left ambiguous.'] ['Megan  has been distraught since her twin sister Sophie  committed suicide a few months ago.

Mike flees from Boulton mortuary in the hearse, while Reggie is trapped inside by The Tall Man\'s spheres. Rather than kill Reggie, The Tall Man inexplicably lets him go. Mike\'s spherical brother Jody persuades a reluctant Reggie to go looking for Mike. On the way, Reggie is attacked by a mysterious psychopathic demon disguised as a police officer. Reggie escapes only after shooting, stabbing, and blowing up/burning the demon. Later, Reggie rescues a woman named Jennifer from her overturned car and takes her to the next town. They stay the night at an abandoned motel where Reggie tells her the story of The Tall Man. A disbelieving Jennifer rejects his advances before Reggie falls asleep and dreams of Mike. Disturbed, Reggie seeks solace from Jennifer and discovers she has two spheres where her breasts should be. The spheres attack Reggie, who manages to destroy one with a sledgehammer but is pinned to the wall by the other. In desperation he strikes his tuning fork and the sphere explodes. Reggie then dispatches the demon Jennifer with the sledgehammer before leaving. Mike, trying to uncover the mysteries of The Tall Man in order to escape his transformation, drives through abandoned towns and remembers the last days of his youth before The Tall Man\'s arrival. The Tall Man appears in the back of the car, assumes control of the automobile, and disappears into a coffin. Mike drives the hearse into Death Valley, where he as he writes his testament, he expresses his intent to force The Tall Man into a "final" confrontation. After attempted suicide and a brief meeting with The Tall Man, Mike passes through a space gate and arrives inside a 19th century, colonial-style house. Outside the house, he meets someone resembling The Tall Man: however, the man is kind and welcomes him cordially, introducing himself as Jebediah Morningside.

Jody appears, but a distrustful Mike accuses his brother of having abandoned him. After defending his behavior, Jody disappears. Mike begins working on the hearse\'s engine, seemingly using parts to build a makeshift sphere.

Mike goes through a gate, but finds himself in a deserted city and escapes The Tall Man only with Jody\'s help. Meanwhile, Reggie arrives at Death Valley and fights off a group of zombie dwarves shortly before Mike and Jody appear through a gate. Mike embraces Reggie and tells him not to trust Jody.

After more ghostly manifestations, Christine and her younger sister  become enmeshed in the strange life of Alexis; but he in turn finds himself manipulated into deeper cruelness than he had in mind."] ['{{plot}} The film opens on a long strand of beach, where several people in white robes gather around a young man named Ilius, adorning him in a vest of leather armor, while an old man hands him a bow and a set of arrows, summoning it to fly to them. The old man tells Ilius the tale of an ancient warrior god named Kronos, who once wielded the bow, and how when he ran out of arrows, the sun itself seemed to vanish from the sky, transferring itself to his bow, making arrows out of pure sunlight. After telling Ilius this tale, the old man and his people depart as Ilius wordlessly departs down the beach. We are then introduced to a powerful sorceress named Ohkren, a woman whose entire head is adorned in a golden mask as she recites a magical chant to make the sun rise before a large gathering of cave-dwelling people. However, it turns out that Ohkren is a sadistic, cruel witch who commands a savage army of wolfmen who quickly invade the caves of these people, slaying their leader, and grabbing a young woman who attempts to flee, and is graphically torn into quarters as Ohkren cracks her severed head open, seemingly devouring part of her brain. In a strange, dreamlike sequence, Ohkren and her wolfmen partake in hallucinogenic drugs when suddenly, a young man devoid of any facial features charges into their chamber, and dispatches Ohkren and the wolfmen with the same magic bow that was given to Ilius. It is then revealed that this was all part of a vision, as Ohkren fears a lone wanderer shall come to slay her. In a fog-filled murky swamp, a lone girl with skin covered in ash, is collecting water from the marshes when she is suddenly attacked by a group of masked men. But they are killed when Ilius arrives with his bow and arrows at the ready. Unfortunately, he soon runs out of arrows and tries to flee, a group of Ohkren\'s wolfmen attack him, but just when it seems that Ilius will die, he is saved by a lone muscular man who easily fends off the attackers with a rock attached to a sling. The lone man reveals his name to be Mace, he offers to accompany Ilius in exchange for saving his life and if Ilius teaches him how to use the bow. Ohkren is quickly informed of her warriors\' failure to kill Ilius, and she resolves to have him dead, no matter what it takes. Its revelaed that Mace has a sort of Beastmasterish type of power as he rescues a hawk and nurtures it back to health. Mace has developed a bit of talent with Ilius\' bow and shows off by killing a lone caveman, for no apparent reason. They take shelter in a cave for the night, but as they sleep, Ohkren\'s wolfmen trap the two heroes inside, blocking all the entrances with burning bushes. Ilius and Mace make an escape through a hole in the ground, but once again find themselves trapped. Fortunately, Ilius notices a snake on the ground slithering through a small hole in the cave wall, Mace fiugres they can get out the same way the snake did. The two quickly break through the thin stone wall and make their escape. This failure is again noticed by Ohkren when she has another vision of the faceless warrior. As punishment, she tortures the leader of her wolfmen to death, and quickly summons a being dressed in plated armor skirt and a plated mask named Zora, who swears that he shall kill the wanderer for her. As Ilius and Mace continue their travels, they come across a small tribe of the cave people, who are apparently familiar with Mace, and invite them in for the night. During the feast they hold, Ilius recognizes one of the girls in the tribe as the girl he saved in the swamps, who has taken a strong liking to him. In the dead of night as the others sleep, the girl takes Ilius to the outside of the cave in an attempt to have sex with him, but Ohkren\'s warriors have tracked down Ilius and Mace and viciously slaughter the girl and all her people. Ilius is dragged away by the attackers as Mace is knocked out in the attack. When he awakens, Mace resolves to rescue Ilius, as he has come to accept Ilius as his one friend. He manages to find the band of Ohkren\'s warriors with Ilius in tow as they have all made camp for the night. Mace swiftly dispatches several of the warriors as he frees Ilius, who manages to grab his magic bow and help Mace slay the rest of their enemies. At this point, Ilius finally explains to Mace that he is on a quest to slay the evil sorceress Ohkren, and put an end to her reign of terror over the people of the land. Although Mace tries to convince Ilius to go back to his land, as Ohkren is too powerful, Ilius refuses to go home until his task is complete. Mace eventually decides that he shall aid Ilius in any way he can, but he still feels that this is a fools errand, as no man has ever managed to slay Ohkren yet. After inexplicably building a raft and then abandoning it. Mace and Ilius travel through an open field, Mace notices that he and Ilius have wandered into an area with some sort of sentient plant. The plant soon reveals its predatory nature by firing a massive rain of quills in order to kill them. Realizing they don\'t stand a chance, Mace and Ilius try to run to safer ground. They soon reach the small beach where they abandoned their raft, but Ilius is suddenly shot in the leg with a quill, which was coated with an extremely deadly poison which manifests itself in boils that ooze blood and pus. They depart the beach via the raft, but with Ilius growing more and more ill, Mace brings the raft to a small island, where he explains that there are some special plants that could heal the ailment. Mace rushes off to the heart of the island where he soon enters a dark and foreboding swamp. He quickly locates the plant, but as he makes his way back to Ilius, he is attacked by a large band of zombies. Upon discovering that they can be killed by impalment, he dispatches a few and manages to escape the rest. Mace returns to Ilius, who begs him to hurry and end his pain, but to his surprise, Mace grabs a large rock, preparing to kill him with it, but he is suddenly attacked by another Mace. The two warriors clash until one Mace manages to pin the other to the sand with a large branch. The pinned Mace laughs and reveals himself to be Zora, the plated skirt spirit that Ohkren had summoned, just before he disappears into thin air. Although shaken by the encounter, Mace quickly makes the healing plant into a paste through the night and administers it to Ilius\' wounds, effectively terminating the poison from the arrow. With Ilius fully recovered, he decides to continue on his journey to kill Ohkren, but this time, Mace refuses to go with him, as he is not willing to die for a task that cannot be done. Although disappointed, Ilius decides to respect his friends wish and offers his bow to Mace as a gift. Mace refuses, stating that the bow has brought too much pain and death to too many people since their adventure started. Ilius then rows off to sea with the raft as Mace departs back the way they came. As Mace travels along the rocky coast, he is soon ambushed by a band of white furry creatures. They demand to know where Ilius is and when he refuses to reveal that information they tie him to a wooden "X" one the edge of a cliff. Meanwhile, Ilius realizes that he can\'t abandon his friend nor can he continue alone. Ilius returns to the coast that the creatures dwell near and spots Mace and quickly realizes the predicament. Ilius attacks the creatures with his magic bow, harnessing the sun arrows power at last as he is no longer afraid of the dangers that await him, unlocking his true potential. However, he is unable to prevent one last survivor of the creatures from pushing Mace off the cliff into the sea below. Mace sinks to the bottom of the sea and is unable to free himself as he is tied to the cross, and nearly drowns, but he uses his animal power and calls two dolphins who half heartedly save him. Ilius, despondent over Mace\'s death or his own culpability in Mace\'s demise, is relieved to find him on the beach and resuscitates him. In gratitude for saving his life, Mace agrees to stay with Ilius for the remainder of their journey. Making camp in another cave, Ilius is soon dragged under the ground by some sort of creature. As he loses his bow, he isn\'t able to put up a fight and is last seen being drug into the dark. Mace is awakened by Ilius\'s cries and jumps into the hole after him. Mace, unable to see clearly, manages to fight off a few of the creatures, until he is overpowered and thrown into a small pit. Mace soon awakens a horde of bats inside the cave, and in the madness of their whole swarm flying around him, Mace notices a blue bat who seems to guide him through a small tunnel that he can use to escape. He reaches the exit, but his elation is deflated as he soon notices blood dripping on him. Upon glancing up, he notices Ilius hanging upside down from the ceiling of the cave, decapitated. Zora is then shown in Ohkren\'s chamber, carrying Ilius\' severed head in his hand, as Ohkren rejoices at having destroyed the one who would kill her. Her victory is cut short when she sees the head open its eyes and realizes that though Ilius\'s body may be dead, his soul lives and that for as long as it does she remains in danger. Back in the caves, Mace has built a funeral pyre for Ilius. As he stands at his side, Mace hears Ilius\' voice, telling him that with his death, he passes the powers he inherited from Kronos unto Mace. When the fire dies down, Mace rubs the ashes of Ilius onto his skin, personally resolving to finish Ilius\' quest, and to slay Ohkren for him. On the cliff where Ohkren was first shown raising the sun, she is once again reciting the sun chant, surrounded by her remaining soldiers and Zora. She is suddenly interrupted Mace, who announces that he has come to avenge Ilius and that this day, the sun shall rise without Ohkren. Stretching out his hand, Mace is now able to summon forth the bow just as the old man did in the beginning. With newfound resolve and courage, Mace easily slaughters the rest of Ohkren\'s soldiers. Zora takes off leaving Ohkren to die. She quickly flees by teleporting into her chamber, however, Mace undaunted fires an arrow that goes through the mountain and knocks her mask off. When Mace arrives in Ohkren\'s chamber, the sorceress rises, revealing her face to be that of a rotted zombie, but apparently blinded as she is unable to find Mace. Knowing Ilius\' task is close to an end, Mace fires one final arrow into Ohkren\'s heart, seemingly slaying the sorceress. However, she is later seen in her wolf form running off with Zora, who has also returned to his wolf form. The cave people, and the people across the land take notice of the change brought on by Ohkren\'s death, and the film ends as Mace departs from the cave, walking off into the distant sunrise with Ilius\' bow strapped to his back, finally at peace that he has avenged his friend, and finished what he started.'] ['The Asphyx tells the story of rich scientist-philanthropist Sir Hugo Cunningham, who discovers an unexplainable blur on the negatives of photographs of dying men he has taken. He originally theorizes that this blur is the soul escaping just as the men die, but doubts linger. Later on, at a party, he is making a motion picture of his fiancée and son who are boating in a lake, and ends up filming their accidental deaths as well. At first, Cunningham does not realize that he has captured that same misshapen blur on the camera, but once he does, he makes the startling discovery that the blur was not moving away from the bodies of those who were dying, but rather towards them. After doing some research, the Doctor finds that the blur is actually an ancient Greek spirit known as an "Asphyx". According to legends, the spirit will appear only at the moment of a person\'s death to take them away to the Underworld. He hypothesizes that, if he can capture their asphyx, a person could become immortal so long as their asphyx is never released.

With the help of his adopted son, Giles, and an electric chair, he successfully imprisons his asphyx in a locked vault. Proud of his success, he insists that both Giles and his daughter, Christina, undergo the procedure. When Christina is killed during a failed attempt at capturing her asphyx, Sir Hugo becomes despondent and requests to have his own asphyx released. Giles agrees, so long as he is given immortality first.

After the sisters are unable to find a record of Rachel with the State Nursing Association, they conclude she is actually Mildred Kemp, a nanny who killed the three children she was paid to care for because she had an obsession with their widowed father. They try to warn their father, but he brushes off their concerns and leaves for work. In desperation, the girls try to gather evidence against Rachel to show the police but Rachel catches them and sedates Alex. Anna escapes and goes to the local police station, but they are disbelieving of her claims and call Rachel to take her home. As Rachel puts Anna in bed, Anna sees Alex in the doorway with a knife. Alex tells her to stay silent and Anna passes out. When she wakes up, she finds that Alex has killed Rachel and thrown her body in the dumpster. Relieved, the girls comfort each other. When their father drives up, horrified at the scene, Anna, holding hands with Alex, explains that Rachel tried to murder them but Alex saved them by killing Rachel. Confused, Steven tells Anna that Alex died in the fire along with their mother. Anna looks down to find that she is not holding her sister\'s hand, but the bloody knife used to kill Rachel. Anna finally remembers what happened on the night of the fire: After catching her father and Rachel together having sex, Anna filled a watering can from a large gasoline tank in the boathouse and carried it toward the house, intending to burn it down. However, she spilled a trail of gasoline that ignited when a candle fell over. Her mother was killed in the resulting explosion, as was Alex. It is revealed here that Anna has symptoms of both severe schizophrenia and dissociative identity disorder. Flashbacks reveal that Alex was never actually there and was a hallucination of Anna\'s throughout the film. She remembers killing Matt  by letting him fall into the water and break his back. She also remembers killing Rachel. The police are called to arrest Anna for murder. When Steven is questioned, he reveals that Rachel changed her last name years ago to escape an abusive boyfriend. The police ask why Anna would make up the Mildred story, but Steven remains speechless. At the mental institution, Anna is welcomed back by the patient that scared her earlier, whose name plate on the door says "Mildred Kemp".'] ["A mother, Hannah, is fatally injured in a car accident and her spirit migrates into the body of her unconscious daughter Samantha when Hannah dies on a gurney next to her. Hannah resolves to keep her daughter's life running smoothly in preparation for her potential return. Hannah, living in her daughter Samantha's body, endeavors to keep up an emotional relationship with the father, Ben, through Samantha, which sometimes veers perilously close to becoming physical, to mutual horror. Her experience helps her to learn a lot about the previously unknown  life her daughter was living and helps her to see how harrowing a teen's life can be in these times, as she struggles to walk the tightrope many teens must negotiate.

While Andrew is collecting evidence, a young boy steals the rosary from the father's hand.The boy later sells it to a woman in a marketplace, who sends it to her daughter Frankie Paige  living in Pittsburgh. Shortly after, Frankie is attacked by an unseen force while bathing, and receives two deep wounds on her wrists. As the wounds are treated at the hospital the doctors cannot find the cause beyond that they are puncture wounds and go all the way through the wrist. Frankie goes to work the next day, but on the way home on the subway approaches a priest and asks if he is Andrew Kiernan. After the priest tells her he is Father Derning, the lights in the train begin to flash, and Frankie holds onto the bars lining the ceiling as she is whipped from behind by an unseen force, Father Derning watching in horror. While Frankie is hospitalized again, the priest sends security tapes showing the attack to the Vatican, and Andrew is sent to investigate. Andrew meets Frankie, who tells him she has been expecting him, and Andrew interviews her, believing her wounds may be stigmata. When she tells him she is an atheist, Andrew tells her that stigmatics are universally spiritual people, and that stigmata is when the deeply devoted are struck with the same five wounds that Jesus Christ received during the crucifixion - thus far Frankie has been impaled through the wrists and whipped. Frankie walks away and begins to research on her own what could be the cause to no avail. Later while at a nightclub, Frankie's head begins to bleed, the third stigmata wound caused by the Crown of Thorns. Frankie runs home, where Andrew is waiting, then runs into an alley. As Andrew pursues her, Frankie smashes a glass bottle and uses the shards to carve symbols on the hood of a car: when Andrew approaches her, she yells at him in another language. Andrew takes Frankie to Father Derning's church, and the Vatican translates what she was yelling as Aramaic, the language of Christ. Frankie goes home, and the next morning Andrew returns to her apartment to find her writing in marker on the wall, now covered in Aramaic. When questioned, Frankie responds in a male voice speaking Italian, then collapses on the bed. Frankie goes out and walks the streets with Andrew, when she collapses as wounds appear in her feet, the fourth wound of stigmata. Andrew emails photographs of Frankie's apartment wall to the Vatican, where Brother Delmonico  recognizes the words and deletes the pictures and tells Andrew the words are from a document the church found that looked to be an entirely new gospel. Father Dario  retrieves the pictures and shows them to Cardinal Daniel Houseman , who also recognizes them. Meanwhile, Delmonico phones Marion Petrocelli  and tells him the missing gospel has been found in Pittsburgh. In Pittsburgh, Andrew goes to Frankie's apartment to find the wall she wrote on painted over, and Frankie attempts to seduce him. When Andrew rejects her she attacks him, wind blowing through the apartment as Frankie denounces Andrew's beliefs in a male voice, ending with Frankie levitating off the bed crying tears of blood. Houseman and Dario arrive at the apartment with Derning and take Frankie to another church, sending Andrew to Derning's. At Derning's church Andrew meets Petrocelli, who tells him the words Frankie has been writing are part of a document found outside Jerusalem that they believed to be a gospel in the exact words of Jesus Christ. Petrocelli, Delmonico and Alameida were assigned to translate it, but Houseman ordered them to stop. Alameida refused and stole the document to continue translating it alone, having been excommunicated by Houseman. Petrocelli tells Andrew that the document was Jesus telling his disciples that the kingdom of God is all around them and not confined to churches, a revelation that could ruin the Catholic Church. Petrocelli also tells Andrew that Alameida suffered from stigmata. Andrew races to the church where Frankie is while Houseman and Dario attempt to perform an exorcism on Frankie. Frankie shouts at them in a male voice, and Houseman dismisses Dario and the present nuns before attempting to strangle Frankie. Andrew arrives and stops him, and the fireplaces in the room erupt and set the room on fire. Now believing Frankie is possessed by Alameida's spirit, Andrew offers to be Alameida's messenger instead. He walks unharmed through the fire to retrieve Frankie, bidding Alameida's spirit to depart in peace. Some time later, Andrew returns to Belo Quinto and finds the original documents for the lost gospel under the floorboards of Alameida's church. The film ends with a screen of text describing the discovery of the Gospel of Thomas, believed according to the film to be the closest thing to the actual words of Jesus while alive: the film states the Catholic Church refuses to recognize the document as a gospel and considers it heresy."] ['{{Plot}} In 1939 Bodega Bay, California, an old puppeteer named Andre Toulon is putting the finishing touches on a living puppet called Jester.

Carissa and Frank, two other psychics who are apparently lovers, are reading the mind of another woman when they get a call from Alex.

Alex, in his room, finds a picture and has a vision of a couple dancing in a ballroom, only to awaken from his vision with the now crumpled picture in his hand. While in the elevator Carissa has visions of Neil violently attacking a woman in the same elevator.

Alex has recurring nightmares of Megan having a gun put to her head by Neil and the other psychics being found dead, but is eventually awoken by Megan, who takes him into the room that Andre Toulon was in, and tells him that Neil found Andre\'s secret to bringing inanimate objects, such as puppets, to life. Alex has a vision and they go downstairs to find the dead bodies of the psychics sitting around a table. They are stopped by the newly resurrected Neil. He explains that "metaphysically speaking", he did commit suicide, but he used Toulon\'s formula to give himself eternal life. He fights with Alex and beats him up, and then hurts Jester. Seeing this attack on one of their own, the puppets revolt against Neil. Pinhead locks him in an elevator, and Neil starts to attack him, forcing him to get out of his way. Neil throws Pinhead to a wall and then bangs on the elevator door trying to get out and shouting \'Open this door!\', Pinhead grabs Neil\'s leg then Neil picks him up and pulls Pinhead\'s head off and throws his headless body and head to a wall.

This is an anachronism, as the European Union was not established until 17 years later .  and uses his seat of power to dissolve the United Nations and create a one world government called the World Union. To consolidate his power, Stone pressures the President of the United States Richard Benson  to join his global community.In the movie’s dialogue, the United States is sometimes equated with "the North American Zone"; however, a stylized world map appears to show all of North America as a single zone, and Mexico is portrayed in the film as a country distinct from the United States. Stone summons Benson to meet with him in Rome. Prior to departing for Italy, President Benson orders the U.S. Navy\'s Sixth Fleet to take up position off of the coast of Italy in the event of an emergency.

During an informal meeting on Air Force One, David and Col. Howard warn the president to keep his distance from Stone. This is due to a CIA report, which indicates that over 200 people who had opposed Stone in the past had died under questionable circumstances. Unfortunately, Benson fails to grasp just how ruthless Stone really is; Stone kills him with a heart attack. David then becomes the President. Much to Stone\'s disappointment, his brother also refuses to join his New World Order. David\'s Secretary of State Breckenridge; however, wants the United States to join the global community aligned with Stone.

After seriously wounding David he summons up his dark brethren as reinforcements and revives his dead army. In a full display of his supernatural powers, he even darkens the sun, plunging the whole battlefield into darkness. The reinforcements soon outnumber and overrun the Mexican, Chinese, and American forces. In triumph Stone, now as Satan, celebrates as he cries out loudly that he is lord. At this boast, a bright white light lances down into ruins of the headquarters and begins dropping meteors of light upon the battlefield. Every enemy soldier is killed, while all of the allied survivors remained untouched and freed from their bonds. The fallen priest is dismayed at Satan\'s defeat and tries to run from the battlefield. A globe of light chases him and quickly impales him with swords of pure light. Satan himself is last, as he is driven to his knees and forced to admit that "Jesus" is Lord. After that the light pulverizes the ground beneath him, dropping him into a deep pit of lava, the Lake of fire. There he finds he is chained. As David lies on the ground still looking up, the light becomes brighter until everything fades away. The movie ends with a scene of paradise and a declaration that God has established his home with man forever.'] ['A schoolteacher  has a nervous breakdown after being exposed to witchcraft during a rebellion led by witch doctors while teaching as a missionary in Africa.

He briefly leaves his young son alone while he runs an errand. A group of teenage campers stop by Harley\'s. While riding their dirt bikes, they mortally injure Harley\'s son. One teen, Steve, stays with the boy until his father\'s return; the rest flee the scene. At their cabin, the campers fight about whether or not to call the police. Joel, who is responsible for the boy\'s injury and is on probation for a similar incident, knocks one of his friends unconscious and locks two others in the closet to stop them from contacting the authorities. Harley goes to see a supposed witch, who says she cannot bring his son back. After Harley says that as a boy, he saw the witch controlling a mysterious creature, the witch agrees to help Harley seek revenge, but she warns him that vengeance comes with a powerful price. On her orders, Harley goes to an old pumpkin patch, digs up a disfigured corpse, and brings it back to the witch\'s home. The witch uses blood from father and son to resurrect the creature\'s corpse. Back at the cabin, one of the girls, Maggie, hears a voice whispering her name. Seemingly hypnotized, she follows the voice outside the cabin. Steve brings her out of her trance, but he is then attacked by the creature and killed. Harley experiences the murder through the creature\'s eyes. While the campers search for Steve, a clawed hand seizes Maggie, dragging her away. Harley has a vision of the creature killing Maggie and he returns to the witch, begging her to stop the monster. The witch laughs and says nothing can stop the monster. She warns that Harley will die too if he interferes. Joel confronts the monster with a knife, but the monster swats him aside and drags off another of the teens. The three remaining campers beg the locals for help, but the locals refuse, saying the three campers are "marked." Harley arrives and shoots the creature, but when Joel checks to see if it\'s dead, the creature impales Joel on his own rifle. A local boy, Bunt, helps the two living campers, Tracey and Chris, reach an abandoned church. Bunt relates the legend of the monster Pumpkinhead, explaining that the creature avenges one who was wronged. If anyone tries to stop Pumpkinhead, that person becomes marked as another victim. The creature attacks and throws Chris against a tree, then drags his body back to Harley\'s house, where Tracey, Bunt, and Harley have taken shelter. Bunt is caught when Pumpkinhead enters the house. While Harley experiences the murder, Tracey is terrified to see that his face has changed to resemble the monster\'s. She runs outside and finds Chris struggling to crawl away as Pumpkinhead prepares to kill Bunt. Harley stumbles out of the barn but is accidentally stabbed in the arm by a pitchfork. Both Harley and Pumpkinhead cry out in pain, and the creature releases Bunt. Harley notices that Pumpkinhead\'s face is turning more human, then realizes that he and Pumpkinhead are one. The only way to kill the creature is to die himself. The creature grabs Tracey by the neck, but before it can kill her, Harley shoots himself in the head. Both he and Pumpkinhead momentarily collapse to the ground. Pumpkinhead grabs Bunt again. Tracey grabs the gun, and Harley begs her to kill him. Harley, now fully changed, tries to attack Tracey. She shoots him several times until both he and Pumpkinhead fall to the ground, dead. Tracey, Bunt, and Chris then watch as Pumpkinhead bursts into flames. Later that night, back in the pumpkin patch, the witch buries Harley\'s now-disfigured corpse in Pumpkinhead\'s grave. The film ends showing his corpse still holding onto the necklace his son Billy, made him.'] ['The legend goes that if you climb the twenty eight steps leading up to the school dormitory, counting each step aloud, and find a twenty ninth, a spirit will appear and grant you a wish. The movie takes place in a girl\'s art school and focuses on two friends studying ballet, however their friendship soon turns sour when they find themselves competing for a single spot in a Russian ballet school. Yun Jin-seong , remembering the old legend of the "Wishing Stairs" wishes for a place in the prestigious arts school, and in a shocking turn of events, she gets it, but at the cost of her best friend, Kim So-hee\'s life. However, it\'s only when the extremely odd character of Eom Hye-ju wishes the dead girl back, that an unspeakable evil is released. The film itself seems to mirror the ballet "Giselle", which girls in the film are studying, as well as drawing upon the classic short story "The Monkey\'s Paw". So-hie as Giselle, and Jin-sung as Albrecht. Unhappy with always having to play the "prince" to So-hee\'s princess, Jin-sung betrays So-hee, which in turn leads to So-hee being crippled and commits suicide after her friend Jin-sung confesses she has hated her all along. When So-hee\'s spirit is wished back, Jin-sung is haunted by So-hee\'s ghost, the love she once felt for her friend warped by Jin-sung\'s hurtful actions. As in the two previous movies, this film has strong themes of friendship, betrayal, and the taboo of lesbian affairs in an all-girls school.'] ['This original story marries three different elements into one plot. The movie is basically a film noir, where a self-destructive, down-and-out investigator takes on a case that may be more than he can handle. Incorporating standard elements like a beautiful woman, excessive drinking and subtle voiceover, the piece is set up like a standard detective film. Later a science fiction angle, which is part conspiracy and part nouveau alchemy, is introduced. This component, to some degree, extends the common understanding of quantum physics. Within this framework the unbelievable is now possible and the story is set up for special effects and general creepiness. One final ingredient is comedy. Mostly situational, the laughs come from the somewhat uncommon characters thrown together in this extraordinary scenario. Rather than punchlines; reactions, comparisons and slapstick are used to ease the tension and create a more fun atmosphere. Not to be forgotten, this is first and foremost a horror movie. Where the film consists of a variety of different genre elements, Aversion is simply a suspenseful film of demonic possession.'] ['HMS Scorpion, a British submarine that had gone missing in the Baltic Sea during World War II, surfaces in the path of a Russian freighter in 1981. The vessel is returned to British custody. Naval Intelligence is interested in the case because it seems that, for the first time, a ship has returned from "the Devil\'s Triangle of the North". The submarine opens its own hatch to let the investigating team in, where they find the vessel in a state of perfect preservation, but find no sign of the crew. Jack Hardy  is the only surviving member of the original crew, having been found floating and rescued in 1943 by the German Navy; but he has no memory of the last days of the 1943 mission. He and Alan Cassidy, one of the vessel\'s designers, join a Royal Navy crew on a mission to retrace Scorpions last days before it went missing. Commander Travis, a naval intelligence officer, is in charge of the mission while Commander Byrnes captains the submarine. The mission will take the submarine into Soviet waters, and a surface ship, HMS Oakland escorts the boat. Once in the Baltic, the current crew begins to take on the personalities and identities of the dead crew, and the boat takes a degree of control over itself. Contact with Oakland is soon lost. A Soviet submarine is detected and through communication error the crew fires upon it and destroys it. Scorpion surfaces for a search for survivors, but, impossibly, no debris is found. Cassidy, who had supervised the fitting of the submarine with practice torpedoes, finds that they have become live weapons. Captain Byrnes tries to abort the mission, but Cdr Travis convinces him to continue. Hardy learns that the real mission is to discover and exploit the power that preserved and delivered the submarine. Soon, three aircraft are detected on radar whilst the submarine is surfaced. The aircraft are WWII Luftwaffe fighters that strafe the boat with gunfire. The captain is killed, and Travis takes command. Cassidy and Hardy find no bullet damage on the deck or tower from the strafing attack, and conclude that Travis may have shot the captain to preserve the mission. Travis apparently becomes possessed by the former captain himself. The original submarine captain\'s intent had been to torpedo ships in a German fleet in the then German city of Königsberg, which is now the Soviet city of Kaliningrad. Modern Soviet officers detect the incoming hostile vessel, and begin preparations for a nuclear war. Hardy manages to get the crew off the boat before it can attack the Soviet fleet, but Travis and the submarine, essentially as one entity, continue the attack. Hardy rewires the torpedo control system, causing the torpedoes to explode in the torpedo tubes killing Travis, and causing the vessel to sink. Hardy dies on his bunk clutching a picture of his wife when the water engulfs him. Six months later, the Soviets find the sunken Scorpion, looking like it had been decaying for forty years. The Soviets close their investigation of the incident. British intelligence intercepts the Soviet report, leading British military authorities to also close their files on the case. Neither Hardy\'s nor Travis\' bodies are found.'] ["When slave traders bring back an evil voodoo entity that is accidentally freed by the Confederate Army during the Civil War. The entity possesses the bodies of the dead soldiers to create an army of its own bent on conquest, using the corpses of both the North and South. When both Union and Confederate soldiers are mysteriously murdered by the entity during the Civil War, the opposing troops must overcome their differences and band together to investigate the gruesome deaths. It soon becomes apparent that these killers are anything but human. Instead, they are a maniacal regiment of supernatural forces, and it is solely up to these united American soldiers to fight the slaughterous evil of the Ghost Brigade. The film centers around Captain John Harling, a Union army man that has been awaiting his parole but it is cut short when there are unusual murders of Union troops. To discover the culprits behind this Harling seeks Colonel Nehemiah Strayn, a former Confederate regiment commander, now sitting in a Union prison at Bowling Green who was once Harling's teacher. The two officers, along with Colonel George Thalman supervising, set out with a small detachment of troops and a runaway slave named Rebecca. When they reach the site where several Union troops were murdered, Strayn tells about what happened to his regiment, whose gruesome end happened at the same place where the Union corpses were found. After leaving the site and wandering deeper into Tennessee, they come across a group of Confederate soldiers, who quickly surrender much to the surprise of the Union troops. The Confederate in charge tells Thalman that their group was attacked by a band of undead troops who took many of his men away, yet he was unaware of why he and his people were taken. Thalman, deciding that they required reinforcements, took off leaving Harling in charge. But during the night, while Strayn & Rebecca are talking just a few yards away from the camp, they are assaulted by Stayn's old regiment, now a bunch of walking zombies. His former second-in-command, Major Josiah Elkins, tells him to lead this new regiment. Strayn refuses the offer however, and escapes with Rebecca to the camp. Strayn warns everyone at the camp and they all hide behind the carts that the Confederates had with them and waited until the zombie soldiers approached them. After holding them off, they are surprised to see Thalman reappear again, but he has been changed. So after being burned by Rebecca he returns to his former self. But before he dies, he puts Harling in charge, in hopes that Harling would see the men out. The next day, since they don't have time to leave the area, they set a trap for the Ghost Brigade. Using Strayn to lure them back to the Union camp, he surprises them by picking up a pistol and killing one of them with a silver bullet which was created from the silver that the Confederates were carrying. The Ghost Brigade goes into a fury and attacks the joint Union/Confederate troops, who were positioned behind a trench filled with water and wagons turned into barricades. Strayn personally fights with Elkins in hand-to-hand combat before Elkins stabs him. But before he can finish Strayn, Rebecca leaps on top of him. The short struggle continues until Rebecca shoots Elkins by aiming at her chest when he was behind her. While barely alive, Harling realizes that she is infected and has to be shot. Strayn tries to intervene but Rebecca is shot. The last remaining zombie soldier cries over Elkin's corpse before he is shot by Harling. With the Ghost Brigade defeated, they head back for Union territory, where Strayn is sent back to Bowling Green prison for a short period, before he escapes and rejoins the Confederate Army. He fights with distinction during the battles of Gettysburg and other major Civil War battles, but his unusual stand against slavery alienates many of his countrymen. While Strayn is fighting in the Confederate Army Harling decides to not take his parole and stay with the Union Army for duration of the war, serving under General U.S. Grant for the remainder of the Civil War. The film ends with Harling telling the story of Strayn going back to the creek where his regiment was murdered, where he is never seen again."] ['A college student discovers her dorm was once a notorious asylum.{{IMDB title|0804443|titlewww.thejohnsonian.com Winthrop changes name for film]'] ['Followed by the death of her friends, a journalist Hong SunJoo comes across a videotape containing incomprehensible images.

A little girl picks up a teddy bear found lying near Sayaka\'s body and, as she looks up at a block of apartments, she says: "There goes another one." At Sayaka\'s funeral, her older sister Mariko has been trying to cheer up Sayaka\'s grieving friends when she soon notices the ghostly form of Sayaka, who whispers: "Mom pushed me." Their mother, deeply devastated by Sayaka’s death, seems to be falling into a world of insanity, which worries and concerns Mariko, who decides to protect her mother by taking on the responsibility of sorting out Sayaka’s estate. As Mariko\'s about to enter Sayaka’s apartment, a little girl appears from the next door and asks her if she’s afraid of #1303. Mariko, puzzled, says she isn’t. The girl nods and casually informs her that "all women who lived there had died, you know." While Mariko clears out the apartment, she repeatedly catches the sight of Sayaka and hears her ghostly voice on phone. Each time Mariko tries to talk to her, Sayaka either stares back or whispers a couple of words before vanishing. During the clear out, Mariko comes across an earring that looked as if it’d been ripped out of someone\'s earlobe. Mariko wonders if this might be a clue. After turning over Sayaka’s apartment to the landlord, Mariko meets a police detective, Sakurai, who reveals that he’s been investigating a series of suicides at #1303 and he doesn’t believe it’s a coincidence. Mariko gives him the blood-streaked earring as she believes it belongs to a previous tenant. Mariko soon comes across a book about the first two tenants who lived in #1303: Yukiyo Sugiuchi and her mother who, during the first few years, lived peacefully together at their apartment. This however changed when the mother becomes abusive towards Yukiyo for hiding food and having her ears pierced, which prompts her to rip the earring out of Yukiyo\'s earlobe. Yukiyo defensively reacts to her mother’s violent reaction with a butcher knife, then watches while her mother crawls into a closet where she eventually bleeds to death. Six months later, the landlord visits Yukiyo’s apartment and reveals his plans to have her and mother thrown out for failing to pay rent. Upset and afraid, Yukiyo sees the ghost of her mother, who’s revealed to have been tormenting Yukiyo since her death. “You’ll never survive without me,” her ghostly mother taunts. Yukiyo picks up a teddy bear and after she touches it gently, she walks to her apartment balcony and jumps to her death. Mariko discovers that since Yukiyo’s death, the next four tenants - with Sayaka as the latest - had moved into #1303 and eventually jumped to their death. The police has ruled each case as a suicide. Detective Sakurai returns the earring to Mariko and says that he thinks Mariko didn’t commit suicide while she was inside #1303 because she still lives with her mother. As Mariko absorbs this, she learns her mother plans to visit #1303 to see Sayaka one more time. She has to save her mother. Unknown to Mariko, the apartment has been rented out to several female college students, who throw a party that night. During the party, Yukiyo appears and pushes some girls over the balcony while terrorising the other party guests. As Mariko arrives at the block of apartments, she spots the authorities removing the bodies from the scene. She rushes up to #1303. As she enters, she doesn’t see her mother who’s closing a door. She disappears when Mariko opens it. Yukiyo appears in front of Mariko who confronts her over her killing of previous tenants including her own sister, but Yukiyo denies the charge, which disconcerts Mariko. However, as Yukiyo becomes hostile towards Mariko, she reveals that her mother is the one who told her to throw them over because they were evil. Mariko returns Yukiyo’s earring to her while promising to look after #1303 and Yukiyo herself. Yukiyo seems to accept this and vanishes, causing Mariko to faint. As Mariko awakens the following morning, Yukiyo appears and knocks her against the balcony railing. Yukiyo tells her that her mother has only one daughter. Mariko notices her ghostly sister Sayaka watching, just as she falls to her death. Standing next to her mother, the little girl says: "There goes another one." Then she and her mother vanish. At #1303, Yukiyo and Sayaka also vanish, leaving the apartment empty once more.'] ['The narrator, Angus Scrimm, in his only words in the film, introduces the audience to the creatures called "djinn" with the following statement: {{quote}} The next scene is set in Persia during the year 1127 A.

The jewel ends up at Regal Auctioneers, where boss Nick Merritt  gives it to appraiser Alexandra Amberson to examine. Her examinations of the jewel wake the djinn. Thinking she saw something inside the jewel, Alexandra takes it to her labworker, best friend and potential love interest Josh Aickman  to analyze. Later, as he is collecting data, light reflections cause the gem to explode and the djinn is released. The lab is destroyed and Josh is killed, upon his wish for relief from his physical pain. Alex, thinking the gem has something to do with the explosion and subsequent death of Josh, tracks down Beaumont, to whom the statue belonged. Beaumont tells Alex to visit a folklore professor named Wendy Derleth  to find out more about Ahura Mazda and the gem. He also invites Alex and her sister Shannon  to a party he is hosting. The folklore professor tells Alex about the jewel, the djinn and its evil history. Later, Alex learns that the djinn needs to power the gem with the soul of humans and then grant her three wishes before he can unleash the djinn on Earth. During this time, the djinn, who had been in demonic form, removes the face of a corpse in the morgue, taking on the dead man\'s form and the name Nathaniel Demerest. The djinn, now Nathaniel, goes about granting people wishes in return for their souls while he searches for Alex. He finally tracks down Alex\'s boss and grants him a greed-inflicted wish so that he can get Alex\'s address. Alex is haunted by visions whenever the djinn grants a wish. She goes to Wendy Derleth\'s house to consult with her again, but Nathaniel has already killed her and taken her form. During their conversation, Alex realizes she is really talking to the djinn. He confronts her and asks her to make three wishes. He even gives her a "test" wish. She uses this wish and orders the djinn to kill itself. He complies by blowing his head off with a gun, yet the wound heals instantly; as the djinn is immortal, he cannot be killed. Alex then uses the first of the "official" three wishes: her first being to know her opponent, the djinn. He teleports her to his terrifying world within the gem, thus demonstrating his true nature to her. Next, she wishes herself back to her apartment, alone. The Djinn had been threatening Alex\'s sister, so Alex sets about finding Shannon. She races to Beaumont\'s party and Nathaniel follows. While talking to Nathaniel at the party, Beaumont makes the mistake of wishing his party would be unforgettable, and Nathaniel begins wreaking havoc by causing the art pieces to kill the guests. The djinn finally corners Alex and traps Shannon, trying to scare Alex into making the ultimate third wish. Alex wishes that the dockworker had not been drinking on the job two days ago undoing the events that followed  and trapping the Djinn in the opal. The dock scene is shown again and the now sober operator has no trouble lowering the crate containing Ahura Mazda. Alex goes to see Josh at the lab. He notices that Alex is strangely pleased with herself, but she will not say why. Back on the statue of Ahura Mazda, which is now in Beaumont\'s private collection, the camera zooms inside the jewel and shows us the djinn on a throne, waiting to be released.'] ["In 1799, New York City, Ichabod Crane is a 24-year-old officer. He is dispatched by his superiors to the Westchester County hamlet of Sleepy Hollow, New York, to investigate a series of brutal slayings in which the victims have been found decapitated: Peter Van Garrett, his son Dirk, and the widow Emily Winship. A pioneer of new, unproven investigative techniques such as finger-printing and autopsies, Crane arrives in Sleepy Hollow armed with his bag of scientific tools only to be informed by the town's elders that the murderer is not of flesh and blood, rather a headless supernatural warrior from beyond the grave who rides at night on a massive black steed. Crane begins his investigation, remaining highly skeptical about the supernatural elements in the case until he encounters the Headless Horseman himself, who kills Magistrate Samuel Phillipse on sight. Boarding a room at the home of the town's richest family, the Van Tassels, Crane develops an attraction to their daughter Katrina, while he is plagued by nightmares of his mother's horrific torture when he was a child. Delving further into the mystery with the aid of the orphaned Young Masbath, whose father Jonathan was a victim of the Horseman, Crane discovers within the Western Woods the Horseman's grave, as well as his entry point into the natural world from the supernatural — the gnarled Tree of the Dead. Crane finds the Horseman's skull is missing, and eventually uncovers a murky plot revolving around revenge and land rights with the Horseman controlled by Katrina's stepmother Lady Van Tassel, who sends the killer after Katrina now to solidify her hold on what she considers her property, a piece of land unjustly claimed by Katrina's father. Following a fight in the local windmill and a stagecoach chase through the woods, Crane eventually thwarts Lady Van Tassel by returning the skull to the Horseman, who regains his head and heads back to Hell along with his enslaver. With his job in Sleepy Hollow over, Crane, with Katrina and Young Masbath, returns to New York in time for the new century."] [' The series is about Light Yagami, a young man and college student whose life undergoes a drastic change when he discovers a mysterious notebook, known as the "Death Note", lying on the ground. The Death Note\'s instructions claim that if a person\'s name is written within it while picturing that person\'s face, that person shall die. Light is initially skeptical of the notebook\'s authenticity, but after experimenting with it, he realizes that the Death Note is real. After meeting with the previous owner of the Death Note, a Shinigami named Ryuk, Light seeks to become "god of the new world" by passing his judgment on those he deems to be evil or who get in his way. After months of killing criminals, Light is dubbed Kira by the public and some believe him to be righteous about killing criminals. Interpol is no closer to catching him, and is going to pass the case on to the Ministry of Health as some disease, until L steps onto the scene. Known as the best detective in the world, L has solved many cases with his assistant Watari. Working with them, L manages to confront Light, live on TV, and deduces he is in the Kanto region of Japan and he can "kill without lifting a finger." The race begins between L and Light to discover each other\'s identity, and a game of cat and mouse ensues between the two geniuses. Later Misora kidnaps Shiori and asks Light to come to the art museum and confess that he really is Kira if he wants to save her. He goes to the museum, but denies that he is Kira, and begs for Shiori\'s release. Misora tells Light that unless he kills her using her real name, which was "Naomi" written in katakana, she would kill Shiori. Light adamantly insists that he is not Kira. Soichiro, upon seeing this, sends the police. Misora immediately becomes upset and distracted, allowing Light\'s girlfriend to break free and run away from her. Misora fires her gun and shoots Shiori, who dies in Light\'s arms shortly afterward, and then afterwards commits suicide by shooting herself. Later, Ryuk finds that Light had actually engineered Naomi\'s death using the Death Note, as he had already found out her name by checking with the church since she revealed to him she was Iwamatsu\'s fiancée and he reasoned that nobody would use a fake name in marriage and written a scenario whereby Misora would commit suicide after shooting Shiori. Obviously, Ryuk is confused, as by doing this, Light would end up killing Shiori, but Light reveals that he had written her name in the Death Note as well. Using these events to foster hatred for Kira, Light asks to join the investigation team when his father checked on him. While Soichiro is slightly reluctant, L immediately grants his wish and it is hinted that he is still certain that Light is Kira. As a prequel to the second movie, Misa, an actress, is chased down an alley by a man wielding a knife, intent on killing her. As she screams for help, the man dies of a heart attack just like Kira\'s victims. A second Death Note lands beside her.  The movie starts with Misa, a TV presenter, getting a 2nd Death Note. Later Misa, using her Shinigami eyes, kills Mogi and two policemen. Sayu was also almost killed until her father Soichiro crashed into the festival wearing a motorcycle helmet. Light kills Takada to regain ownership of his Death Note. Afterwards Light tricks Rem into killing L and Watari. After they both die, Rem dies for intentionally killing someone to help Misa. Misa then gives up her ownership of the notebook and loses her memory of it. Later it is revealed that L did not die and avoided death by writing his name in the notebook stating, "L Lawliet will die 23 days from this date". After proving that Light is Kira, Light pleads with Ryuk to kill L and the task force. Ryuk then agrees but writes Light\'s name in the Death Note, telling Light that anyone who uses the death note is banned from heaven and hell and will instead spend eternity as nothingness. Light dies in his father\'s arms begging him to believe he acted as Kira to carry out justice, which Soichiro had taught him since his childhood, into practice. Later Soichiro goes home and lies to his wife and daughter, saying that Light was killed by Kira. It ends 23 days later, with L dying peacefully.'] ['Norman Bates is again released from the mental hospital he was placed in at the end of Psycho III after serving another few years and is apparently rehabiliated for the second time. Norman is now married to a young nurse named Connie and is expecting a child. However, Norman fears that the child will inherit his mental illness, so he must seek closure once and for all. Meanwhile, radio talk show host Fran Ambrose is discussing the topic of matricide with guest Dr. Richmond, Norman\'s former psychologist. The radio station receives a call from Norman, who uses the alias "Ed" to tell his story. Norman\'s narrative is seen as a series of flashbacks set in the 1940s and 1950s, some slightly out of order. When Norman is six years old, his father dies, leaving him in the care of his mother, Norma. Over the years, Norma  dominates her son, teaching him that sex is sinful and dressing him in girl\'s clothes as punishment for getting an erection in her presence. The two live isolated at the large house as if there is no one else in the world, until in 1949 she becomes engaged to a brutish man named Chet Rudolph, who helps build and finance their family motel. Driven over the edge with jealousy and betrayal, Norman kills both of them by serving them poisoned iced tea, then steals and preserves his mother\'s corpse. He develops a split personality in which he "becomes" his mother to suppress the guilt of murdering her; when this personality takes over, he dresses in her clothes, puts on a wig, and talks to himself in her voice. As "Mother", he murders two local women who try to seduce him during their stay at his newly opened motel. Dr. Richmond realizes "Ed" is Norman and tries to convince Ambrose to trace the calls. Richmond\'s worries are dismissed. Norman fears he will go insane and kill again. He tells Fran that Connie got pregnant against his wishes and that he does not want to create another "monster". He then tells Fran he realizes that his mother is dead, but that she may kill Connie "with my own hands, just like the first time." Norman takes his wife to his mother\'s house and does attempt to kill her. But after Connie reassures Norman that their child will not be a monster, he drops his knife and Connie forgives him. He then burns the house where all his unhappiness began. As he tries to escape the flames, he hallucinates that he sees his victims, his mother and eventually himself preserving her corpse. Bates barely gets out of the burning house alive. He and Connie leave the next day, with Norman proclaiming himself finally free of his mother. The doors of the house cellar close on the rocking chair that continues to rock, while "Mother" cries to be freed. The screen fades to black and the sound of a baby crying is heard, indicating the birth of Norman\'s child.'] ['In the town of Derry, Maine, six-year old Georgie Denbrough is lured to a storm drain when his paper boat drops down into it. He encounters a seemingly friendly clown who calls himself "Pennywise the Dancing Clown." Pennywise tempts Georgie closer with promises of candy and balloons, exclaiming that they all float down into the sewer. He says that Georgie can float too  before revealing his true nature, grabbing him and viciously tearing his right arm off. His older brother Bill is overwhelmed with guilt for inadvertently sending Georgie to his death and is terrorized when his picture comes to life, giving him a stutter from the trauma. He befriends several similar "misfits." One is Ben Hanscom, a loyal, determined, overweight and ingenious builder from a home broken after the death of his military father. He is terrorized by visions of his father trying to goad him into the sewer plant. Another is Eddie Kaspbrack, a hypochondriac, asthmatic boy who is frail and shy. Kaspbrack is taunted and harassed by Pennywise , while attempting to shower at school. The group later includes Beverly Marsh, a tomboy with an abusive father and a dead eye with a slingshot. She believes Bill\'s stories when her bathroom is destroyed by a geyser of blood that he helps clean up before her father gets home. Richie Toizer is a comedic red head who isn\'t afraid to stand up to the school bully, Henry Bowers, and his friends. He is a movie buff, which prompts Pennywise to attack him as the Wolfman. Mike Hanlon, an African American student facing a difficult time in the newly integrated school, often finds himself in the crosshairs of the racist Henry Bowers as well. A photography book comes to life showing him and the others Pennywise\'s history as he threatens the group. There is also Stan Uris, a Jewish boy scout and bird watcher, who is the last to see It that summer when he is trapped by a mummy in an abandoned house. As each of them face their greatest fears , they vow to avenge the deaths of Georgie and every other child killed by "It." They travel into the sewers followed by Henry, who is intent on murdering them for humiliating him. But instead, he witnesses the death of his best friend Belch in a manner that turns his hair completely white. Pennywise attempts to attack the children by separating them, but Eddie manages to wound him and Beverly drives him back by striking him with a silver slug made from one of Ben\'s silver dollars. Their job done, the seven vow to return some day if ever It returns. Meanwhile, Henry is arrested and sentenced to life in an asylum for confessing to the counts of murder of all the children.  Mike had become the only member of the Losers Club to remain in Derry after the events of the 1960s. His memory of the events are still completely intact, and when he hears of the mysterious, unexplained death of a little girl , he begins to suspect It has returned. He calls up each of his friends, who have all become successful in their own right. Bill has become a horror novel writer married to a beautiful actress named Audra; Ben has become a famous architect as he\'d always wanted; Beverly has become a fashion designer; and Richie has become a late night TV comedian. Eddie owns a successful limousine service and Stan has become a real estate broker. Having moved on into comfortable lives and having barely a glimmer of the memories of that summer, they are all traumatized by the memories awakened by Mike\'s phone calls. While they agreed to return as promised, Stan is unable to cope with the fear and kills himself. Upon the return to Derry, their reunion is lighthearted until terrifying events unfold that test their resolve. Beverly encounters a kindly old woman in her old home who tells her that her father is gone, but the woman is more than she appears. Ben sees the skeleton of his father, which is still trying to get him to return to the sewers; later, the group\'s reunion dinner comes to life and tries to attack them. Pennywise, unable to kill them because his influence over them as adults is limited, sends Henry to do the job. Bowers manages to attack Mike and wound him, which forces Bill and others to consider another direct confrontation with the clown. Meanwhile, Audra follows Bill to Derry but falls under the influence of It\'s "Dead Lights" and is made catatonic by him. As the five remaining "Losers" find their way to It\'s cave they are confronted by his true form; a massive, hideous spider-like creature that mortally wounds Eddie when he steps forward to save Ben and Bill\'s lives. Once again, Beverly is able to use her slingshot on the creature; this time the strike rings true and mortally wounds It. In their rage, Ben, Bill and Beverly slaughter and dismember it; they return to Eddie, who dies in their arms. They are able to leave, taking Eddie\'s body and the catatonic Audra with them. In the aftermath, Mike marks his own fading memories of the past as a sign that It was truly destroyed that time, and the adult Losers Club can return to their lives as the memory of the traumatic events fades entirely. Beverly and Ben solidify their childhood crushes and get together, while Audra, still catatonic from her encounter, is coaxed back to life aboard Bill\'s old bicycle "Silver" when he takes her to outrun It\'s fading influence. All as it was, they realize that they can now move on with their lives and leave Derry behind.'] ["Paige , a beautiful artist moves into a new apartment.

During a party at the American Embassy in Berlin, German scientist Gregor Starndorf is told that the comet he discovered, designated Bay-Leder 7, is headed towards Earth. It is large enough to cause mass-extinction and is only days away. He works with the U.S. Army in developing a satellite weapon called SolStar-2, which is used against the comet with moderate success: although the microwave beam cut Bay-Leder 7 in two, the smaller part impacts in West Russia. The head of security, Captain Tom Parker picks up his wife and daughter to evacuate by plane. However, his superior, Colonel Waters, forces Parker to leave them behind, watching helplessly as the plane took off. News reports depict the aftereffects of the impact. Three years later, the situation is still grim. Due to the debris thrown into the atmosphere, all of Europe was evacuated to Africa, where a new ruling body, the New United Northern States , has been established. Oil prices also skyrocketed, enabling the Middle East to establish a firm grip on the world economy. A NUNS technician finds that SolStar-2 is still active. But the satellite can only be controlled from the command center below the Reichstag. Berlin is in the middle of the "death zone", uninhabitable areas because of the cold. A plane was sent to investigate, but it suddenly exploded. Everything pointed to SolStar-2 in the attack. NUNS President Miranda Harrison recruits Parker to lead an expedition—including ex-SAS Sarah Henley and Anna Starndorf,Gregor Starndorf\'s daughter—in order to find out who controls the satellite and destroy it. Although Parker knows the mission is led by Colonel Waters, he ask to join, secretly hoping that his family is somehow alive. During their flight in the SolStar-2 zeroes in on their position and destroys the plane. The team manages to parachute out with two APCs, though. During the trip, they must cross through Cologne and use the Cologne Cathedral as a guide there. However, they lose several men to marauders and one APC to an ice geyser. When they finally reach Berlin, they find that the city is buried in several meters of snow. Shortly afterwards, they came under attack from survivors. There are about 600 people hiding in the subway tunnels and supplied by the "Distributors". They find out a blind man called "the doctor" is hiding below the Reichtag and supplies the people with food. The doctor\'s quarters is actually a verdant greenhouse and he is Gregor Starndorf. He explains that he and his chief engineer Klaus Hintze were the designers of SolStar-2. It was originally meant to be a new power source to lessen the dependency on oil, but due to military funding, it became a weapon. He ordered Hintze to reactivate the satellite as he designed a method to extend its area of effect and stop the permanent winter. He is alarmed to hear Hintze is using it as a weapon, but the Distributors suddenly return and during the battle a sniper kills him. Enraged, the four confronts Hintze, who is powering up the satellite to destroy Tangier, the NUNS\' headquarter city, as a revenge for having been left behind. Sarah shoots him and Col. Waters apologizes to Parker for his earlier actions and allows him to leave and find his family. While he is away, Sarah unexpectedly kills Waters and orders Anna to retarget SolStar-2 to the Middle East. Parker returns and, despite being wounded, attacks Sarah, nearly losing before Anna shoots her. Anna aims the satellite to Europe and executes her father\'s program, causing SolStar-2 to use up its last energy reserves to release a massive, wide-beamed microwave torrent which begins warming the atmosphere. Parker and Anna continue the search for his family and find his home. Inside he discovers his wife\'s final message to him beside their frozen bodies. Back outside, they watch the thick, permanent clouds over Germany dissipate, revealing the warming sun once again.'] ["A violent thunderstorm strands six people in the gothic English countryside including Judy, who's traveling with her father and her cold, self-centered, stepmother.

Among the many patients there is a former astronaut, Billy Cutshaw, who aborted a moon launch and was dragged screaming from the capsule. Colonel Kane, a former member of a United States Marine Corps special unit, arrives at the castle to take over the treatment of the patients. He meets Colonel Fell, who helps Kane acclimate himself to the eccentricities of the patients. Kane pays special attention to Cutshaw, repeatedly asking him why he didn\'t want to go to the moon. Cutshaw refuses to answer, but instead gives him a St. Christopher medal. After meeting with several of the patients, Kane falls asleep in his office. He has a nightmare, and when recounting it he explains to Fell that they are another man\'s nightmares, a former patient\'s. The patient was a soldier who had told Kane he had severed a Vietnamese boy\'s head with a wire trap and the boy was still talking when the soldier found it. Fell asks who the man was, and Kane responds that it was his brother, who is a "murderer". Kane asks if Fell has heard of Vincent "Killer" Kane, a guerrilla soldier who was personally responsible for killing dozens of enemies. Kane says "Killer" Kane was the soldier who told him the story, but was now dead. Later, Cutshaw talks with another patient about Kane. Cutshaw suspects that Kane is actually crazy himself. He asserts that psychiatrists often go crazy and have the highest suicide rate of any profession. Cutshaw goes to talk with Kane again, and they debate God and the idea that there is a divine plan. Kane, who believes that the existence of a God is far more likely than humanity having emerged from "random chance", tries to argue that deeds of pure self-sacrifice are proof of human goodness, which can only be explained by divine purpose. Cutshaw demands that Kane recall one concrete example of pure self-sacrifice from his personal experience. Kane can not. Cutshaw convinces Kane to take him to a church service, and while there he interrupts the service with several outbursts. Looking at an altar boy, Kane momentarily sees a Vietnamese boy. After returning to the castle, Cutshaw thanks Kane and asks him to send him a sign as proof of an afterlife should Kane die first. Kane promises to try. A new patient is scheduled to arrive at the castle and Kane goes to meet him. Kane instantly recognizes the soldier, who calls him "Killer Kane." Kane then flashes back to Vietnam as the soldier stumbles upon Kane, who is kneeling on the ground and muttering that he cut a boy\'s head off with a wire, but the boy "kept on talking". Insisting that they need to leave, the soldier advances on Kane, whom he sees is holding a severed head in his hands. Kane screams and the flashback ends. Kane collapses, unconscious. Finding out what happened, Fell then explains to the staff that Kane really is Vincent "Killer" Kane, and had suffered a breakdown in Vietnam. When Fell, who is actually Kane\'s brother Hudson, was dispatched back to America, Kane received the dispatch by accident. Kane convinced himself that he wasn\'t "Killer" Kane, and was instead a healer - like his brother. Subconsciously hoping to heal people to make up for his "murders" Kane returned to the US as his brother. Realizing Kane\'s mental state, the Army psychiatric staff maintained the charade and sent him to Fell\'s hospital under the pretext of being its commanding officer. In reality, Fell has been the commanding officer all along. Kane awakens and remembers nothing of the incident. Cutshaw escapes the castle and visits a bar. A biker gang recognizes Cutshaw from news reports of the aborted moon launch and begins brutalizing him. A waitress contacts the hospital and Kane, who arrives at the bar to retrieve him. Kane humbles himself to the bikers in order to get Cutshaw out of there, but the bikers are disgusted by his "cowardly" behavior. The gang brutalize and tries to rape Cutshaw. Kane then snaps and kills most of the bikers with his bare hands. Kane and Cutshaw return to the castle, and the police arrive to arrest Kane for the murders at the bar. Cutshaw visits Kane, who has wrapped himself in a blanket. Dreamy and distant, Kane disjointedly mumbles to Cutshaw about God and proof of human goodness before passing out. As Cutshaw leaves, Kane\'s hand emerges from his blankets and drops a bloody knife. Outside Kane\'s room, Cutshaw notices a spot of blood on his shoe. Rushing back in, Cutshaw discovers that Kane has died, sacrificing his own life in an attempt to provide Cutshaw the concrete example of human goodness which he was unable to demonstrate earlier. Some time later, Cutshaw  has returned to uniform and visits the now-abandoned castle. He sits in Kane\'s office and reads a note written to him by Kane shortly before his death. Kane writes that he hopes his death will "shock" Cutshaw back into sanity, but at any rate, he now has his one example of self-sacrifice. Cutshaw returns to his car and discovers a Saint Christopher\'s medal has somehow appeared on the seat. He turns it over to confirm whether it was the one he gave to Kane and silently rejoices at what he sees.'] ["A once successful American singer, Nick Cooper , relocates to a country manor in England, leaving L.A. and a failed marriage behind him, to begin work on his career comeback.

Lansdale is married to a beautiful woman named Anne  and they have a child named Lizzie . Anne apparently is bored with their life in Vermont and insists that she and Lizzie move to New York City so that she and Lansdale can "spend time alone." It appears their marriage is on shaky ground. This is brought up during a car ride in which Lansdale is infuriated by her suggestions and they argue. While they are driving, Anne and Lansdale end up behind a slow-moving truck and an impatient driver behind them. In the heat of argument, Anne, who is driving, gets distracted and pulls out from behind the truck. Another truck comes up in the other lane. Anne attempts to get back behind the other truck but the impatient driver has pulled up too far. Lansdale waves his hand to the impatient driver to move back, and when she does not and Anne has to slam on the brakes, his hand is caught behind the truck, which also stops. The hand is severed completely in a bloody, violent scene. Anne attempts to find the severed hand but it is too late. Lansdale then starts a painful adjustment to not having his right hand, which so happened to be his drawing hand. Anne also adjusts to her guilt of being responsible for the accident and tries to get closer with Lansdale. In a separate instance, he attempts to find the hand himself but does find his signet ring that Anne gave him. They move to New York and Lansdale is approached by his friend and agent Karen Wagner  to co-produce his comic strip with another cartoonist. But when the test boards are discovered marked up, the deal is off and Karen fires Lansdale. Lansdale, however, is certain HE did not mark them up and questions his daughter about the incident. He also loses the signet ring once again. During his recovery, Lansdale discovers that Anne has started moving away from him like before the accident. He becomes jealous of Anne\'s yoga instructor and also seems to begin a slow descent into darkness when an encounter with a homeless man  leaves the man dead at the "hand" of his former appendage. It\'s not entirely clear whether or not this was a real event or something in his mind. Lansdale also starts having hallucinations about different objects coming to life as a hand, like a shower faucet. After his final meeting with Wagner, Lansdale comes forth with his intention to take an offer to teach at a small community college in California. He proceeds to go forward with his plans and meets Brian Ferguson , a rough and rowdy country-and-western psychology instructor, who helps indoctrinate him with the college and the small town locale. He discovers soon that perhaps this was a disastrous move on his part after his first couple of weeks teaching. Another thorn in his side is Anne\'s decision not to move Lizzie and herself out with him. Although unintentional, Lansdale begins a strange affair with one of his students, Stella Roche , when she decides to show up at his house and strip for him. He starts showing his dark descent with an unshaven face and wild, uncombed hair, akin to Jack Torrance in The Shining. Lansdale becomes obsessed with Stella, buying her lacy lingerie for Christmas and insisting on knowing her whereabouts at all times. Stella, feeling smothered and unknown to Lansdale, makes plans to go away for two weeks with Brian. Brian, who knows nothing of the affair between Stella and Lansdale, drunkenly blurts their plans to Lansdale in the local bar. Soon, the image of Stella being strangled under the Christmas tree by the severed hand, pops into Lansdale\'s head. The hand apparently cleans up the mess by the time Lansdale, along with Anne and Lizzie, who have arrived to celebrate Christmas, show up at the house. Not long after, Lansdale once again ends up at the bar with Brian. Confused that Brian should be off on his two week vacation with Stella, Lansdale discovers that Brian has not seen Stella since the night she came to Lansdale\'s house. Brian, even in his drunken state, uncovers the affair between Stella and Lansdale. He is killed by the hand in his car after threatening to call the police on Lansdale about Stella\'s disappearance. It is now that Lansdale believes he controls the hand and it responds to his impulses and desires. He attempts to murder Anne so that he can have Lizzie to himself. While he makes a strong effort by having the hand kill her while she is driving to the grocery store in a rainstorm, she remains unharmed and returns safely. Later that evening, Lansdale argues with Anne and he leaves her room. Soon, screams are coming from Anne. Lansdale enters her room and discovers the hand strangling her and it attempts to escape by going out the window. Lizzie discovers her father over her mother and assumes he is hurting her. He convinces her otherwise and tells her to call the police. He, then, goes after the hand with a butcher\'s knife. After a lengthy struggle, he stabs the hand, but the hand gets away and after attempting something with the car, the hand starts to strangle him until he passes out. Lansdale awakens with his own hand  around his throat while the police are skulking around. The sheriff, with Lizzie in tow, and his deputies attempt to ask Lansdale what happened. While he attempts to explain and he discovers that Anne is not dead, the officers notice a pungent smell permeating the area in the carport around the car, specifically from the trunk. Lansdale tries to prove that nothing is wrong by opening the trunk, only to find Stella and Brian\'s dead bodies inside. Lansdale looks and screams in horror. The scene fades out and then into a green-painted room of a mental hospital with tons of electronic scanning and testing equipment around. Lansdale is strapped down in a chair with electrodes coming out of his head. An elderly woman , apparently a doctor or scientist, with a white labcoat on, is circling Lansdale, attempting to make sense of his rage and why he did what he did. She tries to make an effort with him by loosening the restraint on his mechanical hand and shakes it. She continually questions him about what he\'s feeling. He attempts to tell her that he sees the hand, which she insists is not real and that he did all the killing himself, coming closer to her neck. She laughs it off until the hand actually grabs her and strangles her, smashing her head against the concrete floor. Lansdale, completely taken over by the essence of the hand, looks at her and starts to laugh, loosens the restraint on the other hand and gets up.'] ['After killing his mother and sister and ritualistically arranging their bodies as a sacrifice to Satan, Devil worshipper "Vassago"  invokes a Satanic verse in a room filled with candles and Satanic imagery.

Miranda next wakes up in the very hospital she works for, but as a patient treated by her co-worker, Dr. Pete Graham . Drugged and confused, she remembers nothing of what happened after the car accident. To her horror, she learns that her husband Douglas  was brutally murdered and that she is the primary suspect. While Miranda copes with her new life in the hospital, the ghost uses her body to carry out messages  which leads her former colleagues to believe Miranda is suicidal and is inflicting the wounds on herself. Meanwhile, Miranda bonds with fellow inmate  Chloe Sava . Several times in sessions, Chloe had claimed that she\'d been raped while in the hospital, but Miranda had always attributed these stories to mental illness. One night, the door to Miranda\'s room in the hospital is opened by the ghost that has been haunting her. When she passes Chloe\'s room in the hospital, she can hear the rape occurring and momentarily sees a man\'s chest pressed against the window. The man\'s chest bears a tattoo of an Anima Sola. Miranda realizes that Chloe was not making up these stories, and when she sees Chloe the next day, she apologizes, and the two embrace. Chloe warns Miranda her attacker said he was going to target Miranda next. Miranda begins regaining some of her memories bit by bit, and slowly comes to remember herself killing her husband. She realizes that the ghost had used her body to murder Douglas, thus making Miranda the patsy for his murder. This is why all of the physical evidence points to Miranda. Miranda escapes the hospital, having recognized the girl as a ghost. Seeking clues to the mystery of why she killed her husband, she goes to a farmhouse in Willow Creek, Rhode Island. In the cellar of the barn she discovers a room containing a blood-stained bed, what appears to be a box containing drugs, restraints, and video equipment.

Miranda backs up to a stair case, and all of a sudden an injured, frantically screaming girl grabs hold of her from the adjoining crawlspace. The police release the girl, and Miranda is taken to jail. While she is in jail, Sheriff Ryan , who was Douglas\' closest friend, talks to Miranda, and quizzes her on how she knew all these things. He does not believe her claim that ghosts told her everything, and asks her what sort of person the accomplice would be. Miranda uses her experience as a psychiatrist to give a psychological profile, and as she does so realizes that Ryan fits the profile perfectly. He attacks Miranda and in the fight reveals his tattoo &mdash; an Anima Sola. Miranda kills the sheriff in an act of self-defense, with the help of the ghost. Miranda is next seen walking with Chloe on a city sidewalk discussing how each helped the other come to terms with their experiences.

Until by mischance, he grew wings and flew like a bird. He became a hunter, and like a hawk, he flew to seek his prey. Taking refuge in those far corners of the world where magic still lingers. But having once been a man, so does he still suffer the passions of a man, flying in the rages sometimes, and throwing himself down like a child, to vent his wrath upon the earth. The people of the great Namib have another name for those violent winds that blow from nowhere. They call them Dust Devil\'s" A middle-aged man  walks on a road in the desert, and pulls over a car with a woman named Saarke  driving in it, who takes him back to her house. while the two are making love, the man snaps Saarke\'s neck, killing her. Meanwhile in the town of Bethanie, Sgt. Ben Mukurob  receives a phone call with strange voices speaking, as does Wendy Robinson ([[Chelsea Field  in Johannesburg, South Africa. In the morning, the man burns down Saarke\'s house, inside which he has drawn many strange symbols and pictographs. he then gets into Saarke\'s car and drives away. In Johannesburg, Wendy\'s husband Mark  accuses her of cheating on him, causing her to leave him and drive to Namibia. Meanwhile, Mukurob receives a call about Saarke\'s house and drives to investigate with his superior, Capt. Beyman . Mukurob visits Dr. Leidzinger , who tells him that the incident may be a part of a strange witchcraft ritual. Wendy runs her car off the road and finds an abandoned camper  with a strange man, who she asks to help her push her car out of the sand. She then sees Dust Devil on the side of the road, and stops for him. Cpl. Dutoit  and Cpl. Bates  find the abandoned camper with dismembered body parts inside. Mukurob drives to Joe\'s home, the former bethanie cinema, and asks him about the symbols that were in the house. He responds that it was the work of magic, to which Mukurob scoffs. Wendy and Dust Devil continue driving and pass another hitch-hiker, but Dust Devil tells Wendy not to stop. As they pass the hitch-hiker, Dust Devil disappears from the car. Beyman tells Mukurob that he has to take him of the case and hand it over to the U.N., but says that he can give any information to him. Wendy stops at a small motel for the night and tries to cut her wrists, as Dust Devil waits with a razor outside the bathroom door, but wendy does not commit suicide. She goes to her car the next morning and finds Dust Devil inside, who tells her that she was asleep the day before. Meanwhile, Beyman gives Mukurob a pile of documented murders similar to the one he is following. Wendy and Dust Devil reach the Fish River canyon as Wendy\'s husband Mark, arrives in Namibia. Mukurob has another of his recurring nightmares and is visited by Joe, who tells him to go with him. Mark arrives in Bethanie and asks about Wendy, but is beaten up by some of the people at the bar. Joe takes Mukurob to a small mountain cave and tells him that the murders are the work of the "naghtloeper", a shape-shifting demon who seeks power over the material world through the ritual of murder. He draws the weak and the faithless to him, and sucks them dry. Joe explains that the naghtloeper must keep moving to work the ritual, but if he is tricked to step over a kerrie stick, he will be bound to one spot and his power can be taken. Joe then gives Mukurob a Kerrie and a sacred root to burn to prevent the naghtloeper from possessing him after it is killed.

Wendy reaches the abbandoned town of Kolmanskop where Mukurob finds her and searches for Dust Devil. He runs into Dust Devil, who stabs him. Wendy then finds Dust Devil and tries to shoot him but the gun jams. As Dust Devil walks toward her, Mukurob takes the kerrie and puts it in front of Dust Devil as he steps forward. Wendy picks up Mukurob\'s shotgun and kills Dust Devil as he says "i love you, Wendy". Wendy then walks into the desert past Mark and the car, lays on the road and pulls over a fleet of army Casspirs. The film ends with Joe saying "The desert knows her name now, he has stolen both her eyes. When she looks into a mirror, she will see his spirit like a shore blowing tatters around her shoulders in a haze. And beyond the dim horizon, a tapestry unfolding of the avenues of evil, and all of history set ablaze".'] ['In 2008, Jason Voorhees is captured by the United States government and held at the Crystal Lake Research Facility. In 2010, Rowan LaFontaine, a government scientist, decides to place Jason in cryogenic suspension after several attempts to kill him. While Private Samuel Johnson places a blanket on Jason, Doctor Aloysius Bartholomew Wimmer, Sergeant Marcus, and a few soldiers hope to further research Jason\'s rapid cellular regeneration and try to take Jason. They pull off the blanket covering his body, but find Johnson dead instead. Having broken free of his restraints, Jason kills the soldiers. Rowan lures Jason into a cryonic pod and activates it. However, Jason ruptures the pod with his machete and stabs Rowan in the abdomen, spilling cryonic fluid into the sealed room and freezing them both. In the year 2455, Earth has become too polluted to support life and humanity has moved to a new planet, Earth Two. Three students, Tsunaron, Janessa and Azrael are on a field trip led by Professor Brandon Lowe who is accompanied by an android, KM-14. They enter the Crystal Lake facility and find the still frozen Jason and Rowan, whom they bring to their spaceship, the Grendel. Also on the ship are Lowe\'s remaining students, Kinsa, Waylander and Stoney. They reanimate Rowan while Jason is pronounced dead and left in the morgue. Lowe\'s intern, Adrienne, is ordered to dissect Jason\'s body. Lowe, who is in serious debt, calls his financial backer Dieter Perez of the Solaris, who notes that Jason\'s body could be worth a substantial amount to a collector. While Stoney has sex with Kinsa, Jason comes back to life and attacks Adrienne and then freezes her face with liquid nitrogen before smashing her head on a counter. Jason takes a machete-shaped surgical tool and makes his way through the ship. He stabs Stoney in the chest and drags him away, to Kinsa\'s horror. Sergeant Brodski leads a group of soldiers to attack Jason. Meanwhile, Jason attacks and kills Dallas and Azrael. He then tries to attack Crutch, but Brodski and his soldiers save him. Jason disappears, and after Brodski splits up his team, Jason kills them. Lowe orders Pilot Lou to dock in on Solaris. As he is talking with the Solaris engineer, he is killed by Jason. With no pilot, the ship crashes through a nearby space station, destroying it, and killing Dieter Perez and everyone else on the Solaris. The crash damages one of the Grendels pontoon sections. Jason breaks into the lab, reclaims his machete and decapitates Lowe. With the ship badly damaged, the remaining survivors head for Grendels shuttle, while Tsunaron heads elsewhere with KM-14. After finding Lou\'s remains, Crutch and Waylander prepare the shuttle. Rowan finds Brodski, but he is too heavy for her to carry, so she leaves to get help. Waylander leaves to help with him, while Crutch prepares the shuttle. Jason kills Crutch. On board the shuttle, Kinsa has a panic attack and launches the shuttle without releasing the fuel line, causing it to crash into the ship\'s hull and explode. Brodski attacks Jason, but is overpowered. Tsunaron reappears with an upgraded KM-14, complete with an array of weapons and new combat skills. She fights Jason off and seemingly kills him, knocking him into a nanite-equipped medical station, and blasting off his right arm, left leg, his right rib cage and finally part of his head. The survivors send a distress call and receive a reply from a patrol shuttle. The survivors set explosive charges to separate the remaining pontoon from the main drive section. As they work, Jason is brought back to life by the damaged medical station, rebuilt as an even more powerful cyborg called Uber-Jason. Jason easily defeats KM-14 by punching her head off. As Tsunaron picks up her still functioning head, Jason attacks them, but is stopped by Waylander, who sacrifices himself by setting off the charges while the others escape. Jason survives and is blown back onto the shuttle. He punches a hole through the hull, sucking out Janessa. A power failure with the docking door forces Brodski to go EVA to fix it. Meanwhile, a hard light holographic simulation of Crystal Lake is created to distract Jason, but he sees through the deception just as the door is fixed. Brodski confronts Jason so the rest can escape. As they leave, the pontoon explodes, propelling Jason at high-speed towards the survivors, however, Brodski intercepts Jason in mid-flight and manoeuvres them both into the atmosphere of Earth Two, incinerating them. Tsunaron assures KM-14 that he will build a new body for her. On the planet, two teens beside a lake see a "falling star" as Jason\'s charred mask sinks to the bottom of the lake.'] ["After a body is found in the walls of a French monastery, Commissioner Niemans, played by Jean Reno, teams up with Detective Reda, played by Benoit Magimel, who is already investigating a murder of his own.

We should have known better, but we didn\'t. What does it matter what we think we know? In the end there\'s no denying the truth." A young television journalist for a news network called GNN, Buck Williams, reports from Israel about a new technology with which food will grow almost anywhere, he is interviewing Israeli scientist Chaim Rosenzweig. He calls this a miracle of Chaim\'s making. Suddenly, Arab Mikoyan MiG-29 fighter jets fly over, attempting to attack Israel with a vicious air raid. The sun disappears even though it is still in the mid-day. A missile hits near Buck and Chaim as they retreat to a military bunker. The jets start exploding and crashing down even though Israel forces didn\'t fire a single shot and a commander states they how Israel, "can\'t get those planes up". Buck runs outside with the news camera and records the drama as some GNN executives and reporters watch back in Chicago. The jets explode and crash to the ground and the entire force is destroyed. The story shifts to Pilot Rayford Steele, who has been called in for an emergency flight from New York to London, thus forcing him to abandon his son, Raymie\'s, birthday party. Despite his wife\'s and his daughter\'s protests, he sets out on the flight and leaves his family behind. Rayford\'s daughter, Chloe Steele, is leaving for her college exams. Buck, having decided to go to London for an investigation of the attack, boards Rayford\'s plane. On the flight a flight attendant, Hattie Durham, walks into the cockpit and asks who wants coffee and reveals she\'s taking a job at the UN and this is her last flight. Rayford ends up kissing Hattie outside the cockpit. Later during the flight some passengers awaken to realize that several of their fellow passengers are missing. Panic sets in as Rayford and his crew try to contain this situation. Buck helps Hattie try to keep the passengers calm. Upon returning to the flight cockpit, they discover that people  are mysteriously disappearing worldwide and even planes are down from missing flight crews, and crashes everywhere. He is forced to turn the plane back and land in Chicago. Shortly after landing, Buck locates Rayford and asks him to fly him to NYC. Rayford refuses, saying that he has to be with his family, but tells Buck that he knows of a pilot. He asks Buck to go with him and they drive to his suburban home. Meanwhile, Chloe is driving home from her college exams when she encounters a large traffic accident. She goes to check on a crashed semi, whose driver vanished. People are reporting abandoned cars and children missing from their seats. While Chloe is inspecting the carnage, her car is stolen by a hurt man and she is stranded on the wrecked highway. She eventually starts walking down the highway. Rayford discovers that his wife and son are missing. He and Buck are forced to stay in the house because of a military-enforced curfew. Rayford starts crying, he starts to get upset that he smashes a mirror with his wife\'s Bible, which later he starts to read. Chloe returns home and reunites with her father. Soon Chloe goes downstairs and discovers Buck sleeping on the couch. After conversing about her missing family, Chloe drives Buck to the Airport and goes to look for her younger brother. Buck takes a plane to New York with pilot Ken Ritz. Rayford, trying to find Chloe, finally finds her in an elementary school and scolds her for running away. He apologizes and suggests they search the church because that\'s is where they were most happy. Chloe refuses to go to church, saying that her mother was happiest when Ray was home. After Chloe returns home, Rayford goes to New Hope Village Church  and finds Pastor Bruce Barnes. Bruce knew about God, but didn\'t follow Jesus and was part of the people who were left behind. After raging at God, he begs for forgiveness and asks God for a second chance to help people. Rayford enters the church and kneels next to Bruce. Rayford tells Bruce that God already has used him. They then watch a videotape left by another Reverend Billings dealing with the Rapture, in which all the believers are taken to heaven, while the rest are left behind to endure the tribulation, a horrible 7 year period of time. When Buck gets to New York City, he finds that his friend Dirk Burton has been killed. While he is there, he takes a computer disc and is almost shot by a sniper. Buck decodes the computer disc and finds that someone is trying to bankrupt the UN in order to control the world\'s food supply. Rayford confronts Hattie, telling her that their "affair" was wrong, and that he wants her forgiveness. She leaves in a huff, but Rayford tells Chloe about God and she says she believes. Meanwhile, Buck flies back to Chicago to meet with Alan Thompkins . After the meeting, a car bomb kills Alan, and Buck narrowly escapes. He goes to Rayford\'s house, because they are the only ones Buck knows in Chicago. Taking the wounded Buck to New Hope Church , Rayford and Bruce show Buck the tape that Reverend Billings made. Buck, however, does not fully believe the claims, and he goes to the UN to warn Chaim about the impending mistake. Rayford and Chloe attempt to stop him, because he doesn\'t have God on his side. Buck ignores the Steele\'s advice and goes to the UN anyway. After his departure, Rayford and Chloe pray for him. At the UN, Buck warns Chaim and Nicolae. He sees the plans for the new Israeli temple, and realizes that everything Rayford, Chloe and Bruce told him was true. Before the meeting Buck finally accepts God and asks Him to show him The Way. When God complies, he realizes that UN Secretary-General Nicolae Carpathia is the Antichrist when he reveals his plan for world domination. His plans for rebuilding the temple of Israel are a logical first step to this end. He shoots Jonathan Stonagal and Joshua Todd-Cothran, who behind the plot to bankrupt the UN. Then, Nicolae brainwashes the new "kings and queens"  into thinking that Stonagal rushed a guard, took his gun and then shot Cothran and himself. Everyone, even the press, believes him except Buck. Buck later asks Chaim what he saw and Chaim says he saw the ruse. Hattie states it\'s terrible because Nicolae was such good friends with them. Buck then heads back out of the UN and returns to the church, knocks on the door, and Chloe hugs and lets him in and Rayford and Bruce smile and shake his hand. Narrating, Buck says the "seven years of peace" declared by Nicolae will be the seven worst years mankind has ever seen, and that faith is all we need.'] [' Somewhere in Morocco, Frank Cotton  buys an antique puzzle box from a dealer. Back in the attic of his house in London, Frank solves the puzzle box, prompting hooked chains to emerge from it and tear deep into his flesh. Black robed, horribly mutilated humanoids appear and attack Frank with hooked chains, tearing him into pieces. Their leader Pinhead , picks up the box and twists it back into its original state, taking Frank\'s dissected physical remnants back to their realm with them and restoring the room to normal. Sometime later, Frank\'s brother Larry ([[Andrew Robinson  arrives at the house along with his second wife, Julia , who previously had an affair with Frank. The pair know Frank as an avowed hedonist and petty criminal, and, presuming that he is in jail in some exotic location, decide to move in. Larry\'s teenage daughter, Kirsty Cotton , chooses not to live with her stepmother and moves into her own place. While moving into the house, Larry cuts his hand on a nail, and drips blood on the attic floor. The blood somehow reaches Frank in his prison in the humanoids\' realm, partially restoring his body and allowing him to escape to the attic. That night, Julia finds Frank (now portrayed by [[Oliver Smith  in the attic; still obsessed with him after their affair, she agrees to harvest blood for him so that he can fully restore his body and they can run away together. The next day, Julia begins picking up men in bars and bringing them back to the house, where she murders them with a hammer; Frank then consumes their blood and internal organs, progressively regenerating his own body. Once he has regained enough strength, Frank explains to Julia that he had exhausted all sensory experiences and sought out the puzzle box on the promise that it would open a portal to a realm of new carnal pleasures. Instead, it opened up a portal to the realm of the "Cenobites," who have since taken Frank as their prisoner and subjected him to extreme, sadomasochistic torture. Meanwhile, Kirsty spies Julia bringing men to the house and, believing her to be having an affair, follows her to the attic one afternoon, where she interrupts a murder. Frank attacks her, but panics when Kirsty grabs the puzzle box. Kirsty throws the box out the window, creating enough of a distraction for her to escape. Outside the house, she retrieves the puzzle box and runs away, but collapses from exhaustion shortly thereafter. After being taken to the hospital, Kirsty solves the puzzle box, summoning the Cenobites. Their leader explains that while the Cenobites have been perceived as angels and demons, they are simply "explorers" of carnal experience, practicing a form of sadomasochism so extreme that it transcends the boundary between pain and pleasure. Although they initially attempt to force Kirsty to return with them to their realm, the Leader becomes indignant at the suggestion one of their "subjects" has escaped, and agrees to consider freeing Kirsty in exchange for taking them to Frank. Kirsty returns home, where Larry tells her that he has confronted and killed Frank. Julia shows her a flayed corpse in the attic, and shortly after the Cenobites show up. Kirsty attempts to escape with Larry, but his language and mannerisms ultimately lead Kirsty to realize that Frank (now portrayed by [[Andrew Robinson  has in fact killed her father, and is wearing his skin. Frank pursues Kirsty through the house with a knife, inadvertently killing Julia in the process. He eventually corners Kirsty in the attic, where he brags about having killed his brother. The admission summons up the Cenobites, who ensnare him with chains and tear him to pieces. They then attempt to renege on their deal with Kirsty and take her back to their realm. Kirsty\'s boyfriend, Steve, arrives and looks for Kirsty. Kirsty defeats the Cenobites by reversing the motions needed to open the puzzle box, sending them back to their realm. Kirsty and Steve leave the house together. Afterwards, Kirsty tries to burn the box in a garbage dump.

With the help of Russian mystic Grigori Rasputin, they intend to free the Ogdru Jahad—monstrous entities imprisoned in another dimension—to aid them in defeating the Allies. Rasputin knows that this will be an apocalyptic event that he believes will create a paradise. He opens the portal with the aid of his disciples, Ilsa von Haupstein and Obersturmbannführer Karl Ruprecht Kroenen, Adolf Hitler\'s top assassin. An Allied team is sent to destroy the portal, guided by young Trevor Bruttenholm, who is well-versed in the occult. The German team is killed and the portal is destroyed—in the process absorbing Rasputin—while Haupstein and Kroenen escape. The Allied team discovers an infant demon with a right hand of stone came through the portal; they dub it "Hellboy". Sixty years later, FBI agent John Myers is transferred to the Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense  at the request of Bruttenholm and he meets the adult Hellboy and a psychic, amphibious humanoid named Abe Sapien. He learns that a third BPRD member, Liz Sherman, has recently checked into a mental hospital to protect others from her volatile pyrokinetic abilities. Despite regular visits and coaxing from Hellboy, she is determined not to return. Kroenen and Haupstein resurrect Rasputin in the mountains of Moldova. The three unleash a hellhound known as Sammael. Rasputin imbues Sammael with the power to reincarnate and split his essence, causing two of the creature\'s eggs to hatch and mature each time one dies. Rasputin visits Liz as she sleeps, activating her powers and almost destroying the hospital. Myers convinces her to return to the Bureau. Sammael\'s ability to multiply becomes a problem, as Hellboy repeatedly kills it, creating dozens. Abe is injured while retrieving some of its eggs, and Kroenen critically wounds one of the FBI agents sent with Hellboy. Kroenen, whose mutilated body is run by mechanical parts, shuts himself down, pretending to be defeated. Kroenen\'s body is brought to the bureau. FBI Director Tom Manning is angered by Hellboy\'s recklessness. Myers takes Liz out for coffee and to talk. Hellboy, jealous, covertly follows them. Rasputin appears at the bureau, reanimating Kroenen before confronting Professor Bruttenholm. Rasputin offers him a vision of the future, showing Hellboy is the agent that will destroy the world. Rasputin tells Bruttenholm he will give him a quick death in return for the care he gave Hellboy. Bruttenholm is stabbed in the neck by Kroenen and dies clutching a rosary. Manning takes over the B.P.R.D. and locates Rasputin\'s mausoleum in an old cemetery outside Moscow, Russia. A team led by Manning and Hellboy enter the mausoleum, but swiftly become separated. Hellboy and Manning find their way to Kroenen\'s lair and defeat him. Telling Manning to stay back, Hellboy reunites with Liz and Myers at Sammael\'s nest to defend them, but the creatures overwhelm him. Liz uses her pyrokinetic powers to incinerate the Sammaels and their eggs. Hellboy, Liz and Myers lose consciousness and are captured by Rasputin. To force Hellboy to release the Ogdru Jahad, Rasputin sucks Liz\'s soul out of her body, telling Hellboy that Liz will come back to life if he obeys. Hellboy awakens his true power as Anung un Rama, causing his horns to regrow. He nearly releases the Ogdru Jahad, but the injured Myers reminds him of who he is and that he has the right to choose his own path. Remembering his true self and what Bruttenholm brought him up to be, Hellboy breaks off his horns, returning to his former self and resealing the Ogdru Jahad. Hellboy stabs Rasputin with one of his broken horns. Rasputin has been possessed by a creature from the Ogdru Jahad. The tentacled Behemoth bursts out of Rasputin\'s body and grows to immense size, killing Rasputin and Ilsa. Hellboy allows himself to be swallowed by the beast while detonating a belt of hand grenades. The explosion tears the Behemoth apart. Liz\'s vital signs are gone when Hellboy returns from the fight, but he whispers into her ear and her life is restored. When she asks how her soul was returned, Hellboy replies that he told the creatures from the other side the cost of taking her: "Hey, you on the other side. Let her go. Because for her I\'ll cross over, and then you\'ll be sorry." She and Hellboy kiss, and she surrounds them in flame as Myers stands and watches.'] ['Rose Elliot , a poet living alone in New York City, finds an ancient book called The Three Mothers.

While Angela is lighting the candle, Judy places the lighter on the table and starts to walk away. Angela warns Judy that she should not let the spirits see her "littering up the place".

Meanwhile, elsewhere in the house, the four departed friends find a room where Max begins to tell the story of Hull House, and the story behind its rumors.

In a state of panic, Roger gives up trying to find the gate yet has no desire to return to the house, so he hides inside Jay\'s car. Inside the house, an argument between Jay and Judy continues over sexual tensions before Jay leaves her in the same room, not realizing that the door locks, keeping Judy trapped inside. Stooge continues to wait for Suzanne outside the bathroom while inside her face ages in the mirror, transforming into a hideously disheveled demon. After hearing what sounds like a mirror breaking, Stooge enters the bathroom only to find no trace of her around, discouraged over this he decides to head back to the main living room. Back in the living room, Sal sits waiting for the others to return and watching Angela, slightly intrigued by how beautiful she has become. After asking her what exactly she was doing, she explains the day of atonement is at hand, then exhibits bizarre behavior. Having never seen Angela exhibit such behavior before, he realizes something is wrong. Suddenly, Angela begins to dance. Angela\'s black dress soon becomes more transparent, as if disappearing. Sal meanwhile becoming more and more sober by the second decides to leave, yet cannot take his eyes off her. Just as he is about to leave, Stooge comes. Sal tries to warn him of her weird behavior but he does not listen and Sal decides to leave. Stooge then begins to take advantage of Angela\'s apparent distraction only to be surprised when she tells him to kiss her; when he does, Stooge begins trying to pull away. After throwing Stooge across the room he gets on his feet, his face covered in blood as Angela chews on it, then spits out his tongue, laughing in the strobe light. Sal finds Suzanne in a room covered in lipstick. He realizes everyone is acting weird and leaves the room. Meanwhile, Max and Frannie find another coffin in a room and decide to have sex inside of it. Suzanne takes off her shirt and after applying more makeup, shoves the lipstick tube inside her left breast, just before Jay walks in and they begin to have sex. Sal returns to the living room to tell Angela he is leaving, only to have her respond by turning around with her hands on fire. Realizing that something is very wrong with the party and its host, Sal tries the door but finds it locked, and after hearing Angela\'s voice become deep and frightening, he leaves the room. Meanwhile, back outside, Roger has fallen asleep in Jays car until he feels a bump. Expecting it to be a prank, he thinks nothing of it until Helen\'s dead body hits the windshield. Terrified, Roger decides to return to the house to warn the others. Suzanne and Jay are having sex when suddenly she begins quizzing him about her makeup. Confused by this, Jay says she looks fine when suddenly Suzanne changes into a demon, and shoves her thumbs into his eyes. Back in the coffin, Max and Frannie are interrupted by a now possessed Stooge who breaks Frannie\'s neck; her body lands on Max, trapping him inside. Stooge then severs Max\'s arm hanging outside the coffin. Back in the house, Roger is looking around when he is confronted by Angela who has now completely transformed. In his escape, he runs into Sal who knows something is wrong and they team together to get out. Stooge appears at the door to the room Judy is locked in. After Stooge leaves the door, Sal and Roger hear Judy yelling and find her, letting her out of the room. Roger then sees Angela approaching and runs away, leaving the other two. Judy sees Angela and becomes momentarily crippled with fear, before Sal gets her into a room. Once inside, the light comes on and the two find Suzanne holding Jay\'s dead body. Suzanne tries to block the two from one another by knocking Sal out the window and deliberately letting Judy run out into the hall. Once out in the hall, all the doors begin to shut and lock leaving her no place to go, except one room. The room she enters is where Max and Frannie lie within the coffin. Max\'s dead arm grabs Judy\'s ankle causing her to scream in terror, causing the bodies to sit up and reach for her. After escaping the room, Judy runs to the only door unlocked, which leads to the balcony atop the mansion. Sal comes to outside in what he discovers is an air lift, which he climbs up. Knowing Stooge is approaching the area, Judy quietly approaches the edge of the house, where she sees Roger on the ground. He warns her as Angela appears and attempts to throw her off the roof. Sal, who had reached the top already, intervenes, causing Judy to lose her footing and be left dangling from a gutter. In the ensuing fight between Sal and Angela, they both fall off the roof, with Sal landing on a spike. Judy ends up falling, landing atop of Roger but spraining her ankle. After being confronted by Stooge and Angela again, they run back into the house, ending up in the basement, specifically, the crematorium. Stooge and Angela begin pounding on the door. Once they get inside, Judy and Roger have formed a makeshift flame thrower from a gas pipe in the cremator and douse the two with fire. The two flee the scene and once again try the doors, only to find them still locked. At the living room door, Roger leaves Judy alone after he sees Jay, which, accompanied soon by a burnt Angela, corners the two in the room, soon joined by Sal and Max. Roger, seeing the only way out as jumping through the window does so, and Judy quickly follows. The two realize their only means to escape is by climbing over the brick wall surrounding the property, albeit riddled by barbed wire. Roger climbs quickly to the top, leaving Judy alone to deal with the demons who are approaching her. After swatting at her clothes and burning the skin on her leg, Roger appears again trying to help pull Judy over. Right as she manages to reach the top of the wall the demons begin to die from the rising sun. On the other side they watch the actual demon leave the bodies and roar mightily at them before vanishing into thin air. The two walk slowly home, battered and bruised, and pass near the home of an old man. Inside his house, the man sits down to eat one of his wife\'s home-made apple pies, which she made with the apples into which he had stuck razor blades. The razor blades begin cutting through his throat as they kill him. The woman kisses his head and says "Happy Halloween dear" while sipping on her coffee.'] ['Two brothers Seth  and Richard "Richie" Gecko , wanted by the FBI and Texas police for a bank robbery that has left several people dead, stop at a liquor store with the intent of just picking up a state map, but the psychotic Richie kills Ranger Earl McGraw  and the cashier ([[John Hawkes  and burns the store down.

Chaos ensues as the employees, the strippers and the house band  are all revealed to be vampires. Most of the patrons are quickly killed. Richie is bitten by Santánico and bleeds to death. Only Seth, Jacob, Kate, Scott, a biker named Sex Machine  and a Vietnam veteran trucker named Frost  survive the attack. They quickly establish an alliance in order to survive through the night. Seth convinces the group that Jacob is their best weapon, if he rediscovers his faith, and they also figure out how forming a cross with two objects helps fend off the vampires. The slain patrons, including Richie, reawaken as vampires, forcing the group to kill them all. During this second struggle, one of the vampires bites Sex Machine\'s arm. While the group is listening to Frost recount an event from his days in Vietnam, Sex Machine transforms into a vampire and bites both Frost and Jacob before being tossed through a boarded up window, which allows many other vampires, in the form of bats, to enter. Seth and the Fullers retreat to a storeroom and improvise anti-vampire weapons from supplies left by prior victims of the bar. The four stage their final assault on the vampires, their weapons proving effective in destroying many of the creatures. During the battle, Sex Machine is killed by Kate and Jacob slays the vampiric Frost. Jacob transforms, but Scott is hesitant to kill him and gets bitten. He manages to dispatch his father and is dragged down by other vampires. Kate follows the wishes of her brother and kills him, also destroying his attackers. As the sun rises, only Seth and Kate remain alive, surrounded and low on ammunition. Just then, sunlight breaks through the bullet-holes in the bar walls and burns the vampires. Seth and Kate shoot out more holes, which allows them to survive until Carlos and his guards show up. They open the doors, and the sunlight reflects on the bar\'s disco ball, killing the rest of the creatures while Seth and Kate flee outdoors. Safely outside, Seth confronts a bewildered Carlos , who asks if the bar was run by psychopaths. Seth sarcastically replies that psychopaths don\'t explode in sunlight. Angry over the deaths of Richie, Jacob and Scott, Seth demands that Carlos lower his 30% take for his stay in El Rey and telling them to wait in the bar, to which Carlos reluctantly agrees. Kate offers to accompany Seth, but fearing for her safety, he declines and gives her some cash. After Kate drives the RV away, the camera pans back to reveal that the "Titty Twister" bar is the top of an Aztec temple partially sunk into a valley wall, most likely the source and true home of the vampire monsters who\'ve been spreading their curse for centuries, with many abandoned motorbikes and trucks seen around it which means many people met a horrible end.'] ['As with the first film, the second focuses on the cursed house of the Saeki family. The curse was caused when Takeo Saeki murdered his wife Kayako Saeki, son Toshio Saeki and the family cat Mar before being hanged by Kayako\'s vengeful Onryō . Karen Davis, an American careworker, became involved in the curse and attempted to burn the house down to end it, only to be hospitalized. In the first part, her ill mother hears the news about her and sends Karen\'s sister Aubrey to bring her home. Aubrey struggles to speak with the Japanese hospital staff so a journalist, Eason, translates for her, having dragged Karen from the house fire, and who is curious about the house himself. Aubrey briefly speaks with Karen ]] who gets into a panic due to telling Aubrey not to go into the Saeki house and has to be strapped to her bed. Karen manages to get free and escapes to the roof, pursued by Kayako\'s ghost who throws her off the building to her death in front of Aubrey and Eason. Eason explains the curse to Aubrey, venturing to the house to retrieve Kayako\'s old diary. However, Aubrey is lured into the house by Toshio, who grabs her and pulls her inside the house, and becomes cursed like Eason. Taking the diary to an associate, Eason and Aubrey learn Kayako\'s mother Mrs. Kawamata was a priestess who exorcised evil spirits from cursed people using Kayako as "bait" . Planning to visit Mrs. Kawamata later, Aubrey falls asleep in Eason\'s apartment whilst he develops some photographs of the Saeki house. However, Kayako emerges from a photo and kills Eason. The next day, Aubrey finds Eason\'s body and hugs it, but it suddenly becomes Kayako. She then runs out of the darkroom in horror as all the pictures show Kayako\'s face. Aubrey flees to find Mrs. Kawamata. She finds the elderly woman in a rural village, but Mrs. Kawamata explains the curse is irreversible. She realizes Aubrey brought Kayako with her, and tries to murder her herself, only to be suddenly stopped by Kayako  - a motive which will be revealed later. After calling her mother for a final conversation, Aubrey ventures into the Saeki house. She demands to know the motive of the curse and enters a flashback, seeing Karen walking into Kayako\'s bedroom, looking for her boyfriend. Aubrey follows her and shouts at her not to enter, but instead meets the evil Takeo Saeki in Kayako\'s bedroom, reading Kayako\'s diary. Takeo attacks Aubrey, breaks her ankle and forces her to crawl downstairs just like the original victim, before he catches up with her, seizes her hair, and breaks her neck. Toshio watches as Takeo kills Aubrey, and drowns him just like before. Before she dies, Kayako comes out from another room and looks down at Aubrey with her wide, staring eyes. In the second part, two years later, three schoolgirls, exchange student Allison, vain Vanessa and her friend Miyuki, visit the Saeki house to challenge the rumors that it is haunted. However, Vanessa and Miyuki trap Allison in the house\'s closet where Toshio and then seemingly Kayako appear. The girls flee the house and are haunted by the Saeki family. Miyuki is killed by Kayako while staying at a love hotel with her boyfriend, who is showering. When she leans back, feeling something in her sheets, she rests her back on the mirror, then suddenly Kayako reaches out from the mirror behind her and drags her into the glass. Allison and Vanessa are spoken to by the school counselor Ms. Dale, but the distraught Allison runs off, followed by Ms. Dale. Vanessa is terrified when Toshio calls her using Miyuki\'s phone, and she quickly runs to a public phone booth and tries to call Miyuki from there. However, Kayako\'s death rattle is heard on the other line, causing Vanessa to drop the phone in horror. Suddenly, Toshio grabs her legs and she is consumed by Kayako\'s hair. Allison later speaks with Ms. Dale in her office about the house. She tells Mrs. Dale that the curse has consumed Miyuki, and Vanessa, but discovers that Mrs.Dale went to the house and says that there is no curse, making Allison believe that she will be Kayako\'s next victim. Suddenly, Miyuki and Vanessa appear on either side of Allison as ghosts and Ms. Dale becomes a ghost and makes a loud moaning noise. Realizing that Ms. Dale has also been killed by Kayako, Allison flees the office. In the third part, 6 months later, in an apartment block in Chicago, Jake Kimble is disturbed by a strange presence in the building. His father and stepmother Bill and Trish are influenced by the curse, Bill becoming convinced that Trish is having an affair. However, his confrontation is short-lived when Trish wallops him with a frying pan, killing him. Sally, best friend to Jake\'s sister Lacey is also affected and dies. Jake is mostly fearful of the hooded stranger seen in the apartment of the Flemings, Jake\'s neighbors. The stranger covers the windows in newspaper. Jake and Lacey return from school to find their apartment in a mess. Jake finds his father\'s body, then finds Lacey who was drowned by Takeo\'s evil spirit and then Trish appears in the tub as well, who tells Jake that it\'s time for his bath, before Toshio pulls her underwater. Fleeing his apartment, he finds out that the Flemings are dead and finally confronts the hooded stranger, revealed to be Allison. It`s then revealed that Allison is still alive, but completely consumed by the curse. In the final sequence, Allison tells Jake that the curse had followed her and is revealed that Aubrey is the new onryo, but Jake\'s eyes widen with horror when he sees Toshio\'s eye in Allison\'s hood. Aubrey\'s ghost then consumes Allison by pulling her inside her hood. Jake, left alone in the corridor, picks up Allison\'s discarded hoodie, Kayako emerges from it, uttering her death rattle, and looms towards Jake.'] ['The Astral Factor, also released as The Invisible Strangler is a 1976 film horror film starring Stephanie Powers and Robert Foxworth.

The group includes Stephen and his pregnant girlfriend, Tristen, who are researching the Blair Witch for a book they are writing; Erica, a wiccan; Kim, a goth psychic; and Jeff, their local tour guide. Their first stop, where they camp for the night, is the ruins of Rustin Parr's house. Jeff places cameras to catch any sightings that may occur. That evening another tour group approaches their camp and claims to have jurisdiction over the ruins. Jeff and his tourists lie and convince the other group that they saw something horrifying at Coffin Rock earlier. The other group leaves to investigate. Jeff and the others wake the next morning with no memory of the previous night. Tristen and Stephen's research documents are shredded and strewn about, and Jeff's cameras are destroyed. Their tapes are found unharmed in the same spot the Blair Witch Project footage was discovered. As they debate why the tapes were spared, Tristen notices that she is bleeding and has miscarried. Later, at the hospital, Tristen sees a ghostly young girl walking away backwards. After she is discharged, Jeff takes the group to his home, an abandoned broom factory in the woods. It has an elaborate security system, including a deep trench and bridge to the entrance, many surveillance cameras, and a front door that plays the sound of barking guard dogs whenever it is opened. They review their tapes and find hours of footage are missing. At one point, they see a naked woman swinging around a tree backwards. Jeff enlarges the video, revealing her to be Erica. Erica remembers no such event and runs to a nearby room to pray. Kim drives to a store to buy beer and has several unpleasant encounters with the locals, ending in a heated argument with the cashier and Kim being ordered to leave the store. Back at Jeff's, she reaches into her shopping bag and pricks herself on a nail file the cashier was using. She doesn't recall grabbing it and it has blood on it. Erica goes missing the next morning. She isn't indoors but nobody heard the front door. Kim discovers Erica's clothes surrounded by a circle of lit candles. Shortly after, the sheriff calls to say that the other tour group was found gutted and laid out in the shape of a pentagram on Coffin Rock, and that he believes Jeff is responsible. That night Stephen sees Erica through a window, naked and swinging backwards around a tree just as in their tapes. He runs outside, where she tells him he knows what he must do. She runs off and the bridge collapses under him. He avoids falling by grabbing a ledge, and while climbing he sees the same girl Tristen did in the hospital. She repeats Erica's statement before vanishing. The sheriff calls again and tells Jeff he's outside and has some questions. Jeff doesn't understand since the bridge is out, but a security monitor shows it is now intact. He opens the front door, but the bridge is once again broken and the sheriff isn't there. Instead, across the chasm there is a pack of barking dogs. He grabs a rifle but the dogs are gone. When he returns the gun to the closet, he finds Erica's corpse inside. The group sits in the loft trying to make sense of the situation. Tristen suggests everything is backwards. They are confused, but Kim tells Jeff to play the tapes in reverse to view the lost footage. This works, and the new footage shows Tristen leading them in an orgy and the ritualistic murder of the other tour group. Once the video ends, Jeff begins taping Tristen and demands a confession. She asks Stephen for help, but he turns on her and claims that she deliberately killed their baby. Tristen ties a rope around her own neck while deriding the others for letting fear drive them to a witch hunt. She focuses especially on Stephen, who pushes her over a railing in a moment of rage, causing her to hang by her neck and die. The group is arrested and interrogated separately. In Kim's room, they play security footage from the store of her stabbing the cashier in the neck with the nail file. In Jeff's video, he arranges Erica's clothes and stows her body in the closet. In Stephen's video, they show him lynching Tristen and cursing her as a witch. All three claim they never did those things."] ['In Ghazni Province, Afghanistan, a Special Forces team meets CIA Agent Benjamin Keynes, who explains their mission is to find a very important Afghan cleric by the name of Mohammad Aban. The team leader, Wally Hamer briefs the men to be ready. After being inserted, the team finds a local guide, Abdul , in a village in Southern Afghanistan, where the cleric is from. Together, they go to the mountains, where the cleric has a reputation for hiding. As they go further into the mountains, they begin to have strange encounters. First, they are ambushed by gunmen, who kill Trinoski. The team returns fire, killing multiple gunmen, but when the check the bodies, they have disappeared. That night, the team spots headlights of a vehicle approaching. However, the two lights separate and then speedily fly into the sky and disappear. After speculating on what the lights may have been, they radio for a helicopter to resupply them. The next day, they cannot get reception on their radio or GPS. Their truck, damaged from the ambush, is struggling to move up the mountain. At night, the team hears a helicopter approaching, though they cannot spot it. As their radio is not working, they attempt to signal the helicopter. As the helicopter, still unseen, sounds to be directly on top of them, the noise abruptly and instantaneously stops, something that shouldn\'t be physically possible. Meanwhile, the radio picks up what sounds like Farci or Arabic, but no one can understand it. They cache Trinoski\'s body so that they can move to a safer position for the night. The next morning, the team finds parts of Trinoski\'s body strewn out across rocks. Further up the mountain, they spot strange, triangular markers made of sticks across the mountain\'s surface. As they continue on foot with their mission in the rocky and barren landscape, fatigue, frustration and confusion take their toll on the members of the team and they come across a cave. Inside, they find an old man who gives them shelter and refills their canteens. Sergeant Sadler notices that under the man\'s robes, he appears to be wearing a nineteenth century British army uniform. Sadler tells the others of a legend of how a British regiment disappeared in Afghanistan\'s mountains, leaving only one survivor. In the morning Sergeant Cole observes the old man apparently talking to himself. But when he looks through his night vision goggles, the soldier sees a a group of men with swords in black robes. Panicking, the soldier opens fire, accidentally killing the old man. Abdul says they must bury the body, but Keynes orders the team to move on in case the enemy heard them. One soldier, the medic, develops horrible stomach pains. As he tries tries to drink from a canteen, he finds that it is full of sand, as are everyone else\'s water containers. Further on, Abdul is surprised to find that there is an entire valley that did not used to be there. The tensions further increase when the team is encountered by a bright light at night. As K.T. and Cole try to flank the light, believing it to be a ruse by the Taliban, they\'re immediately vaporized. The next morning, Abdul warns Keynes that they are dealing with a supernatural phenomenon that is beyond human conception, and has deadly consequences; he then commits suicide by stepping off a cliff. As the team progresses further and tensions among the men increase, the soldiers confront Keynes and demand the truth. Keynes shows them a recording from his thermal imaging camera and informs them about the real motive. The thermal video shows a triangular object in the desert. Being nearly invisible to the naked eye, it lifts off the ground after three  men, including Muhammad-Aban, walk to it and vanishes right in front of Keynes\' eyes. It was this object that killed the men. The CIA monitored this phenomenon for some time and sent Keynes and the special forces team there to further investigate it. The whole time, Keynes has been recording with his special thermal camera and sending the images to Langley via an advanced laser aimed at CIA satellites. Keynes theorizes that this object originates from an ancient Indian mythology called \'Vimanas\', a sort of UFO-related phenomena that occurred when Alexander rode through this area of land as he was conquering, and the bright lights and the ghostly gunmen are associated with it. He also explains that the team is an \'expendable\' for the investigation and they will not be rescued, which causes a brief scuffle with the agitated sergeant. Running out of ammo, water and food the team wanders further into the desert where they finally encounter the vimanas at what appears to be the location that the British regiment was destroyed. Sadler, overwhelmed with fear, opens fire upon the seemingly invisible vimanas only to be vaporized. Keynes flees with Degetau and abandons him later, as is too sick to continue, and later hears his screams before being obliterated by the objects. Exhausted and traumatized, Keynes searches for water. He encounters an oasis and drinks water from it only to discover the body of a fellow soldier laying next to the water. Unable to grasp the horror, he passes out. When he wakes up in the night, he hears the distant sound of a helicopter and fires his flare gun. Simultaneously, several flares fire up from the valley. The bright light he encountered earlier re-appears and two beings from it approach him. As it touches his forehead, he sees visions and hallucinations of various objects and landscapes from his previous encounters, causing him to go into a trance. In the final scene he is shown floating several inches above a bed with a talisman he took from Aban\'s home in his hand, inside a hospital room, where doctors and a military colonel are observing him through a glass window. In a trance, he finally whispers, "They will save us all..." In the final credits, interviews of Keynes\' wife are shown in which she says that the family has not yet been informed about him and concludes him to be missing. This film heavily references Djinn myhtos.'] ['The movie is narrated by two puppets, voiced by Naseeruddin Shah and his real-life wife Ratna Pathak Shah. Enthusiastic young Lachchi  is to be married to Kishen , the son of the rich merchant Bhanwarlal . Kishen is a dutiful son who honors his father\'s wish to start a new, far-away business on a predetermined auspicious date, which happens to be the day after the wedding ceremony. On the wedding night, Kishen turns away from his wife to finish his bookkeeping, and in the early morning hours sets off on a business trip that is to last five years. Lachchi is devastated; Gajrobai , her husband\'s sister-in-law, consoles her, empathizing on the grounds that Gajrobai\'s husband Sunderlal  has also disappeared. The next day, a ghost appears, having taken Kishen\'s shape and voice because of his own attachment to Lachchi. Lachchi is thus presented a riddle  between the representation of all of her desires in the form of the ghost and her real husband. She takes this new, fond, sexual, magical, social, self-confident version of Kishen as hers. As Kishen, the ghost befriends all of the real Kishen\'s family and keeps Bhanwarlal happy by providing him with magical, possibly illusory, gold coins. His only blunder is in his treatment of the messenger Bhoja, who is perplexed by the idea that Kishen has sent a letter from his business trip only to receive it himself in his own house and offended when the ghost  does not offer him a drink of water. Lachchi\'s bliss goes on until four years later, when she is pregnant and the real Kishen returns to see if the rumors about his wife\'s pregnancy are true. He returns to find the ghost in his  own form. Kishen\'s family is unable to determine which of the doppelgangers is the real Kishen . They decide to visit the king so that he can arbitrate.

The real Kishen is found out and everyone returns home. Lachchi is devastated over the loss of the ghost. In the very end it is revealed that the ghost has escaped the bottle and taken control of Kishen\'s body in order to live with her. By now Lachchi has given birth to a daughter, Looni Ma, by whose identification the ghost exposes his identity to Lachchi. The puppets close the film, remarking that the film\'s plot is "an old story".'] ["Steve Kady , a US Census Bureau researcher is sent to the remote and seemingly idyllic village of Rockwell Falls to interview residents concerning the population.

He is caught in a repeating loop of time that lasts for 1 hour. At the end of the hour, time resets. Everything he was wearing when he was caught in the loop is back on him. An interesting note is that his position in Space does not change. If he was across town when time resets, he does not end up back where he was when he became caught in the time loop. In theory he could travel as far as he could in the 1 hour and just keep going when time resets. He feels that he is alone until he starts meeting others that are also caught in this loop. The movie keeps track of his "Cycles" or time loops. When he is telling the story it is Cycle 8729 and we see another loop begin at the end of the movie. Living that many loops, his sanity begins to fray. He begins to question his faith.'] ["John Klein  is a hotshot reporter for The Washington Post whose life suddenly takes a turn after he and his wife Mary  are involved in a car accident after she apparently tried to avoid something on the road.

The next night Klein decides to park outside of Gordon's house and see who is actually knocking on the door. He is met there by Connie and they wait together to see if anyone will show up. While no one shows up, Connie mentions that many strange things have been occurring the past few weeks. They go back to the police station and review the files of the different reports. One of the pictures in the files matches very closely with Mary's drawings. Klein helps Connie investigate, while also becoming friendlier with Gordon. While talking with Gordon one day, it is revealed to Klein that Gordon had heard voices from his sink telling him that in Denver, 99 will die. Scared that Gordon has the same ailment that killed his wife, Klein takes Gordon to the doctor to get checked. Gordon is found to have a migraine, which serves to make Gordon only more paranoid. While discussing the day's events at a local diner Klein notices that news is showing a story on an airplane crash in Denver that killed all 99 passengers aboard. The next night Gordon frantically explains that he has met the voices in his head. The being is named Indrid Cold. Later that night Gordon calls Klein and says that he is standing with Indrid Cold. While Klein keeps Cold on the line, Connie goes out to check on Gordon. Indrid Cold answers Klein's questions that convince him Cold is a supernatural being. It is revealed when Connie gets to Gordon's house that he is in fact not on the phone with Cold and has been in bed for a few hours.

The governor is scheduled to visit the glue factory in the coming days and Klein is convinced this is when the tragedy will occur. While Klein tries to warn the townspeople, he is ignored. When the governor's visit goes smoothly, Klein is left confused. A little while later Klein receives a call from Gordon and rushes to check on him. He finds Gordon dead from exposure. The medical examiner estimates that Gordon has been dead about eight hours. The Mothman becomes a personal obsession for Klein. He meets an expert on the subject, Alexander Leek , who explains the nature of the supernatural being and details his own experience with it. While drinking at a hotel bar Klein receives a note that says his dead wife Mary will call at noon on Friday at his Washington, D.C. home. He rushes back and anxiously awaits. Just before noon Connie calls him and invites him back to Point Pleasant, saying that no one should be alone on Christmas. She also pleads with him to ignore the call that he believes is coming. Klein decides to drive back to Point Pleasant. As he leaves the phone rings and he finds himself fighting whether to answer it or not. He decides against it and rips the phone out of the wall, disconnecting it. This however does not stop the phone from ringing. As Klein reaches the bridge into town, there is a massive traffic jam. When talking with another driver stuck it is revealed that there was a problem with the traffic lights, leaving the bridge packed with cars. It is also shown that Connie is in the middle of the bridge in her car. As John walks onto the bridge to investigate further the bolts and supports of the bridge begin to strain at the weight. The bridge starts to come apart, making John realize that the tragedy that was prophesised to him was not the glue factory, but the bridge. As the bridge crumbles Connie's car is thrown into the water. John jumps in after her and pulls her from the car and up to safety. As the two sit on the back of an ambulance they see that they have just survived the collapse of the Silver Bridge. The ending credits of the film state that the cause of the collapse was never fully determined. It also tells the audience that while the Mothman has been sighted in many other places, it was never again seen in Point Pleasant."] ["Two young adults, Mitsuru and his girlfriend Maki, kidnap a little girl and hold her for ransom to pay off a drug-related debt.

Only the local Aboriginals seem to recognize the cosmological significance of these weather phenomena. During one of these "freak rainstorms" in Sydney, an altercation occurs among a group of Aboriginals in a pub, which results in the mysterious death of one of them. At the coroner\'s inquest, the death is ruled a homicide; and four men are accused of murder. Through the Australian Legal Aid system, David Burton  is procured for their defence. The circumstances by which he was contacted and retained are unusual, in that his law practice is corporate taxation and not criminal defense. He nonetheless takes on the case, and his professional and personal lives begin to unwind. Plagued by bizarre dreams, Burton begins to sense an "otherworldly" connection to one of the accused . He also feels connected to the increasingly strange weather phenomena besetting the city. His dreams intensify along with his obsession with the murder case, which he comes to believe is an Aboriginal tribal killing by curse, in which the victim believed. Learning more about Aboriginal practices and the concept of Dreamtime as a parallel world of existence, Burton comes to believe the strange weather bodes of a coming apocalypse. The film climaxes in a confrontation between the lawyer and the tribe\'s shaman in a subterranean sacred site. Overcoming the shaman, Burton escapes to the surface to warn about the Last Wave. Seeing a huge wave looming high above Sydney, he collapses in despair in the last shot.'] ["In Spain, the vanished six year old daughter of the editor Claudia  and her husband Marc is found completely mutilated in a well by the police, being recognized by her husband only due to a bracelet and leg defect .

By killing all of his other selves,  and absorbing their life energies into himself, he believes he will become "The One", a godlike being. YuLaw is briefly captured by MVA agents Rodecker  and Funsch , only to escape from captivity during the final phase of his sentence to life in a penal colony. The last known alternate, Gabriel  Law, works in the Los Angeles County Sheriff\'s Department. For two years he has been experiencing increases in strength, speed and mental ability but neither he nor his wife, T.K. Law  , can understand why. While transporting a snitching prisoner for the Sheriff\'s Department, Gabe "feels" Yulaw\'s presence just before he attempts to kill Gabriel Law. Yulaw escapes, with Gabe giving chase and leaping a very high wall – which is humanly impossible. Upon landing on the other side Yulaw faces Gabe and shoots him, but not fatally. Going in for the kill, Yulaw is interrupted by Rodecker and Funsch. Gabe Law sees Yulaw, who is identical to him in every way. Being unfamiliar with interdimensional travel between universes, Yulaw\'s appearance is incomprehensible. At the hospital again Gabe feels Yulaw\'s presence. There is another fight and Rodecker and Funsch again intervene. Yulaw deters them from shooting him because if he is killed, then Gabe will pose a problem because he would then be left as the only "One". Dressed alike and identical in every way, Gabe and Yulaw\'s battle confuse Gabe\'s Sheriff Department colleagues. Both Gabe and Yulaw manage to escape the hospital. Rodecker is faced with a dilemma: they are chasing two superhumans, they cannot kill either one. Funsch insists that YuLaw, as the instigator, must be dealt with in a more aggressive manner. Rodecker makes a fateful decision to "go way off procedure" and split the team. Rodecker pursues Yu Law and is killed. Funsch catches up with Gabe and tells him about the multiverse and why he has become stronger. Yulaw finds Gabe\'s residence where TK, believing it is Gabe, attempts to protect him, but she senses he is not really Gabe. Gabe arrives only to have Yulaw force him to watch while he kills her. Funsch finds Gabe and they team up to find Yulaw at the next occurrence of a wormhole – an industrial plant. Yulaw, Gabe Law and Funsch arrive at the industrial plant, where the final battle between Gabe and Yulaw takes place. Ultimately Gabe is victorious, but all three are caught in the wormhole and travel back to the MVA headquarters in the Alpha Universe. YuLaw is transported immediately to the prison colony universe after a last-ditch attempt to switch places with Gabe. The MVA then prepares to send Gabriel back to his own universe where he will be arrested and put in prison for the murders Yulaw committed, but Agent Funsch instead sends him to a universe similar to Gabe\'s past via another wormhole, after Gabe told him about the events which led up to him meeting his wife. Yulaw, now in the penal colony, declares his intent to still become the one; standing at the top of a Ziggurat in the Hades universe, in order to prove his capability of becoming the one, YuLaw commences to battle oncoming waves of hundreds of provoked fighters approaching the Ziggurat as the credits roll.'] ["In Moldavia, in the year 1630, beautiful witch Asa Vajda  and her paramour Javuto  are sentenced to death for sorcery by Asa's brother. Before being burned at the stake, Asa vows revenge and puts a curse on her brother's descendants. A metal mask with sharp spikes on the inside is placed over the witch's face and hammered repeatedly into her flesh. Two centuries later, Dr. Thomas Kruvajan  and his assistant Dr. Andre Gorobec ([[John Richardson , are traveling through Moldavia en route to a medical conference when one of the wheels of their carriage is broken, requiring immediate repair. While waiting for their coachman to fix it, the two wander into a nearby ancient crypt and discover Asa's tomb. Observing her death mask through a glass panel, Kruvajan breaks the panel  by accident while striking a bat. He then removes Asa's death mask revealing a partially preserved corpse that is visible underneath, her face staring out malevolently. He cuts his hand on the broken glass. Some of his blood drips onto Asa's dead face. Returning outside, Kruvajan and Gorobec meet Katia . She advises them that she lives with her father, Prince Vajda , and brother Constantine  in a nearby castle that the villagers all believe is haunted. Gorobec is instantly smitten by the beautiful young woman. The two men then leave her and drive to an inn. The witch Asa is brought back to life by Kruvajan's blood. She contacts Javuto telepathically and orders him to rise from his grave. He does so and goes to Prince Vajda's castle, where Vajda holds up a crucifix to ward the reanimated corpse away. However, Vajda is so terrified by the visit that he becomes paralyzed with fear. Katia and Constantin send a servant to fetch Dr. Kruvajan, but the servant is killed before he can reach the inn. It is the evil Javuto who arrives to bring Kruvajan to the castle. Javuto leads Kruvajan to Asa's crypt, and he watches in horror as her coffin explodes. From its ruins, the vampire-witch offers him eternal life  and drinks his blood. By Asa's command, the now vampiric Kruvajan enters Vajda's room and murders him. Asa's plan is to drain Katia of her blood, believing that this act will grant her immortality. A little girl who had seen Javuto meet Kruvajan at the inn describes the dead man to Gorobec. A priest recognizes the description as being that of Javuto. The priest and Gorobec go to Javuto's grave and find Kruvajan's body inside the coffin.

Javuto finds Katia and takes her to Asa. Asa attempts to drink her blood but is thwarted by the crucifix around her neck. Gorobec enters the crypt to save Katia but finds Asa instead. Asa pretends to be Katia and tells Gorobec that the now weakened and unconscious Katia is really the vampire. She tells him to kill Katia immediately by staking her. He agrees but at the last possible moment he notices the crucifix she is wearing. He turns to Asa and opens her robe, revealing a fleshless skeletal frame. The priest then arrives with numerous torch-carrying villagers, and they burn Asa to death.

The submarine is ordered to pick up survivors spotted adrift by a British PBY Catalina patrol plane. At the wreck site, they retrieve three survivors &mdash; a British nurse and two sailors, one wounded &mdash; from a British hospital ship that was torpedoed several days earlier. As they pick up the survivors the Tiger Shark spots a German warship bearing down on them. The submarine has several encounters with the German warship and suffers heavy damage from depth charges in the process. Immediately after the first attack the commanding officer of the Tiger Shark, Lieutenant Brice , discovers that the wounded sailor is actually a German POW, Luftwaffe pilot and family man Ben Archerlift. Brice confronts him because he thinks Archerlift has been making strange noises to betray their position to the German warship. Brice believes it was an act of sabotage, and shoots Archerlift dead when the German panics and grabs a scalpel to defend himself. The crew experiences eerie phenomena seemingly related to the recent death of the previous captain, Lieutenant Commander Winters. According to Brice, Winters was killed trying to obtain a souvenir from a torpedoed German ship; he fell and hit his head while reaching for his souvenir, then drowned before he could be rescued. Disembodied voices are heard, a series of mechanical problems keeps the submarine turning back towards the site of the sunken German ship, and crewmen are accidentally killed at an alarming rate. They begin to suspect a supernatural influence. They also begin to question Brice\'s version of how and why Captain Winters died. It is revealed that Brice and two other senior officers were responsible for the death of Captain Winters, and that the British hospital ship was mistaken for a German ship and was sunk by the Tiger Shark. The three officers could not afford this blot on their records and conspired to suppress the story, killing Captain Winters as he tried to save the wounded in the ocean to make up for his and his crew\'s drastic mistake. This is discovered after one of the senior officers is mysteriously killed while working on the exterior of the sub, and the other is impaled on an outside railing after trying to escape the boat after seeing Winters\' ghost. The boat is ultimately crippled by the mounting accidents, and only five crew members remain alive: Brice, Odell, Claire, Stumbo, and eccentric crewman "Weird" Wally. Brice and Claire face each other down on the surface deck of the disabled submarine. Claire has spotted another ship in the area and tries to get its attention, but Brice holds her at gunpoint. His remorse over the accident overcomes him, and he shoots himself in the head, falling dead into the ocean. The four survivors are picked up by ship spotted by Claire, which turns out to be British. The Tiger Shark sinks away from the surface, coming to rest on the ocean floor next to the British hospital ship.'] ['When ambitious analyst Lincoln Mathers  relocates his family from New York to London, his wife Sarah  discovers a new disturbing power and becomes hostage to an ancient spirit. As Mathers notices that the family is tearing apart and that his wife\'s behavior becomes more violent and erratic, he accepts that to save the woman he married he must take a leap of faith. London Voodoo is one of the few films about voodoo to show the belief system in a positive light. Here, it\'s "work" that\'s evil. The film shows multicultural voodoo followers in a contemporary urban setting . As research for the script, the filmmakers travelled to Cuba, Miami and New Orleans to experience voodoo first hand.'] ['In May 1962, dozens of wealthy passengers are dancing in the ballroom of an Italian ocean liner, the Antonia Graza, while an Italian woman  sings "Senza Fine.". On the deck, a young girl named Katie , is sitting alone, until the Captain of the boat himself offers the dance. Elsewhere, a hand presses a lever that unravels a thin wire cord from a spool. The spool snaps and the wire slices across the dance floor like a blade, bisecting the dancers. Only Katie is spared, due to the Captain leaning protectively over her, and her height. The Captain\'s face splits open at mouth level as the top of his head falls off as Katie screams in horror. 40 years later, a boat salvage crew—Cpt. Sean Murphy , Maureen Epps , Greer , Dodge , Munder , and Santos —is celebrating a recent success at a bar, when Jack Ferriman , a Canadian weather service pilot, approaches them and says he has spotted a mysterious vessel running adrift in the Bering Sea. Because the ship is in international waters, it can be claimed by whomever is able to bring it to port. The crew sets out on their ship, the Arctic Warrior, an ocean salvage tugboat. They discover the ship is the Antonia Graza, which mysteriously disappeared in 1962 and was believed to be lost at sea, as both the crew and the passengers were never heard from again. When they board the ship and prepare to tow it, they discover that it contains a large quantity of gold. However strange things begin to happen. Epps claims to have seen a little girl on the stairwell. Greer claims to have heard a woman singing throughout the ship. Epps and Ferriman discover the corpses of another salvage crew. They decide to leave the ship but take the gold, but an invisible force opens a gas valve in the engine room and the Arctic Warrior explodes as the engine is started, killing Santos and leaving them stranded. They attempt to fix the Antonia Graza and sail it back to land, but the crew members are picked off one by one. Greer meets Francesca, the singer who he heard, who seduces him and then leads him off a precipice to his death. Captain Murphy, after entering the Captains Cabin, comes across the ghost of the Antonia Graza\'s Captain, who explains that they recovered the gold from a sinking cruiseship Lorelei, along with a sole survivor. He shows Murphy a picture of the survivor, who he is shocked to recognise. He rushes to tell the rest of the crew, but a supernatural force causes him to see everyone he meets as the burned ghost of Santos, causing the crew to think he has gone mad and lock him in the drained fish tank. Meanwhile, Epps meets Katie, who reveals  that the crew of Graza turned on the passengers and each other. The sole survivor of the Lorelei convinced the crew of the Graza to turn on the passengers in order to claim the gold. The crew killed all of the passengers , including Katie , but then turned on each other. The last officer, after killing his crew mates was shot by the singer, Francesca. Another man then joined Francesca in an embrace and walked away as a large hook swung into her face, killing her. The man is revealed  as Jack Ferriman, who is actually a demonic spirit who masterminded the massacre in 1962 and may have done something similar on the Lorelei. Epps deduces that Ferriman lured the salvage team to the Graza to repair the sinking ship, and that the best way to fight him is to sink it. She sets explosives, but is confronted by Ferriman, who has killed the last of her crew. Ferriman describes himself as a salvager of souls; collecting souls is his job, which he says he earned by a lifetime of sin. He explains that since Katie was a child and never committed a true sin, he can\'t control her as he does with the evil ghosts. So long as the Antonia Graza remains afloat, he can continue to use it as a trap and keep his masters  satisfied. After a brief struggle, Epps detonates the explosives and sinks the Graza. Katie helps Epps escape the rapidly sinking ship. She is left in the debris as the souls trapped on the ship ascend to heaven; Katie stops to thank her. After drifting on the open sea for some time, Epps is found by a cruise ship and taken back to land. As she\'s loaded into an ambulance, she sees the battered crates of gold being loaded onto the cruise ship by Ferriman and the crew. He glares at her and carries on; she screams as the ambulance doors close.'] ['In the town of Castle Rock, Maine, Johnny Smith , a young New England schoolteacher, is in love with his colleague Sarah Bracknell ([[Brooke Adams .

Casey\'s eyes begin to change color; a doctor asks if she is a twin, and explains the change as tetragametic chimerism and heterochromia, and that is completely normal. Her neighbor\'s infant dies, supporting the superstition. Casey\'s father admits that she had a twin brother years ago who died while he was in the womb when her umbilical cord strangled him, and whom he and Casey\'s mother had nicknamed "Jumby". She begins to suspect that the spirit is haunting her and that is the soul of her dead twin wanting to be born so it can enter the world of the living as evil. Casey meets Sofi Kozma&mdash;whom she later learns is her grandmother&mdash;who explains that as a child she had a twin brother who died during Nazi experiments in Auschwitz during World War II. A dybbuk brought the brother back to life to use as a portal into the world of the living. Kozma killed her twin to stop the spirit, and now it haunts her family for revenge, which is why Casey\'s mother became insane and committed suicide. Kozma gives Casey a hamsa amulet for protection; instructs her to destroy all mirrors and burn the shards; and refers her to Rabbi Joseph Sendak, who can perform a Jewish exorcism to remove the dybbuk out of her soul. Sendak does not believe Casey\'s story until he sees a dog with its head twisted upside down in his synagogue. The dybbuk kills Kozma and, soon after, Romee. Casey and her boyfriend Mark&mdash;who both see the spirit after it kills Romee&mdash;realize that it is getting stronger. Sendak, Mark, Episcopal priest Arthur Wyndham, and other volunteers begin the exorcism, but the dybbuk attacks them and several are wounded or killed. The spirit, having possessed the priest, chases Casey and Mark. Mark knocks Wyndham unconscious but gets possessed. Casey stabs Mark in the neck with the amulet; Sendak arrives and he and Casey complete the exorcism. The rite draws the dybbuk out of the human world, but Mark falls and dies during the separation. Casey mourns her boyfriend but still wonders why the dybbuk became suddenly active in her life now, and why it didn\'t attack her earlier. She takes the pregnancy test, and learns that she is pregnant by Mark, with twins.'] ["In the Sengoku period, a woman  and her daughter-in-law Shige  who live in a house in a bamboo grove are raped and murdered by soldiers, and their house is burned down.

The economy of the town is mostly agricultural, and the town is surrounded by vast cornfields. One particular year the corn crop fails and the people of Gatlin turn to prayer in an attempt to ensure a successful harvest. A mysterious boy preacher, Isaac Chroner ([[John Franklin , arrives and takes all the children of Gatlin into a cornfield to speak to them about the prophecies of a demon called "He Who Walks Behind The Rows". Isaac, through his lieutenant Malachai , leads the children of the town in a revolution, brutally killing all of the adults in the town. Over the ensuing years, the children take any adults passing through as sacrifices. Three years later, Burt  and his girlfriend Vicky  pass through Nebraska while driving cross-country to Burt\'s new job as a physician in Seattle, Washington. They are traveling in their car and hit a small boy out on the highway. This boy was one of the Gatlin children who tried to escape the iron hand of the death cult. The couple place his body in the trunk. They encounter an old mechanic, who is little to no help, as the children of Gatlin have employed him to lead all adults passing through to the town, but they betray him and kill him anyway. Burt and Vicky finally end up in Gatlin, after searching for several hours for a phone. A struggle ensues between the couple, "He Who Walks Behind the Rows" and the children as the couple are violently chased through the city. Burt and Vicky rescue Job and his little sister Sarah, who do not wish to be part of the cult. Vicky is captured by Malachai, and she is prepared as a sacrifice before they track down and capture Burt and the children. Meanwhile, Malachai and the others have grown tired of Isaac\'s arrogance. Assuming command over the children, Malachai orders Isaac to be sacrificed in Vicky\'s place. Night soon falls and Burt enters the cornfield to rescue Vicky. The sacrifice soon begins and Isaac is devoured by He Who Walks Behind The Rows. Burt arrives and battles Malachai, convincing the children that their minds have been poisoned and their humanity sacrificed in the name of their false god. As Malachai tries to regain control of the children, Isaac\'s re-animated corpse  appears and kills Malachai, breaking his neck. Soon, a terrible storm gathers over the cornfield and Burt and Vicky gather the children inside a barn to shield them from He Who Walks Behind The Rows\' angry wrath. As the storm intensifies all around them, Job shows a Bible verse to Burt and Vicky that indicates that they must destroy the cornfield for the chaos to cease . While filling the irrigation pumps with gasohol fuel, He Who Walks Behind The Rows lashes out at Burt, preparing to destroy the barn. However, Burt is able to spray the fields with the flammable liquid and lights a Molotov cocktail, tossing it into the field, burning it and seemingly destroying the demon. Burt, Vicky, Job and Sarah survive and are able to leave Gatlin as the cornfields burn. As Burt grabs the map they used to get there, a teenage girl who is a member of the cult jumps out at him from the back seat and attempts to stab him. Vicky knocks her out with the passenger door, and the four walk off into the distance to parts unknown.'] [' The first scene opens with the coven preparing for a ritual, only to discover that Adrian , who is now eight years old, is missing from his room. Knowing Rosemary  must be responsible for this, the coven members use her personal possessions to enable the forces of evil to locate her. Rosemary and Adrian are hiding in a synagogue for shelter. While hiding there, supernatural events begin to affect the rabbis. However, as they are seeking sanctuary in a house of God, the coven is unable to affect them. The next morning, Guy , who is now a famous movie star, gets a call from Roman Castevet . Roman informs Guy that both Rosemary and Adrian are missing and that Rosemary may attempt to contact him. Later that night, Rosemary and Adrian are sheltering in a bus stop. Rosemary makes a phone call to Guy, while Adrian plays with his toy car nearby. As soon as Guy answers the phone, Rosemary immediately issues instructions on how to send her money. Outside, some local children start teasing Adrian and bullying him by stealing his toy car. Suddenly, in a fit of rage, Adrian knocks the children unconscious to the ground. After hearing all the noise, Rosemary hangs up the telephone and runs outside to find Adrian. Attempting to flee, the pair are accosted by Marjean , a prostitute who was witness to the incident. Marjean offers them to hide the pair in her trailer. After a little while, Rosemary asks Marjean to go see what had happened with the children. After Marjean comes back, she lies and tells Rosemary that two boys were killed. Marjean is obviously a follower of Roman and Minnie , but she offers to help Rosemary get a ride on a bus somewhere. After a bus finally arrives later that night, Rosemary gets trapped inside. The doors slam shut behind her before Adrian can get on. Rosemary then turns to the driver, only to discover that there is no driver, and that the bus is possessed and is driving itself. We then see Marjean holding Adrian in her arms, as he sees his mother for the last time, being taken away by the self-driving bus.  Over twenty years later, an adult Adrian  and his best friend, Peter , are detained by police for speeding. When Adrian arrives at his home, which is his "Aunt" Marjean\'s cheap casino, she confronts him about his reckless behavior. She tells him that she\'s always worried about him ever since his parents were "killed in an automobile accident". Adrian then decides to go take a joy ride and instigates a fight with a gang of violent bikers. Peter finds Adrian, who tells him what happened and how he has been suffering from strange nightmares and violent urges. Later that night, Roman and Minnie arrive at the casino pretending to be Adrian\'s aunt and uncle. As they prepare for his birthday party, Minnie drugs Adrian into unconsciousness and dresses him up into a costume and devil makeup. Peter, who notices something is wrong, becomes even more suspicious when he sees the movie star Guy Woodhouse arriving. After Guy and Roman join the rest of the coven, they begin to chant, attempting to invoke Satan. Although it initially seems as though the ritual failed, Adrian is possessed and runs out on the casino\'s dance floor. Roman soon realizes that Satan is using Adrian to possess all the innocent people on the dance floor. Guy soon becomes frightened and runs away. When Peter sees Guy attempting to escape, he attempts to make him help save Adrian. Guy panics when Peter struggles with him, so he electrocutes Peter with a broken power cord.  When Adrian regains consciousness, he is in a hospital and has amnesia. He is kept there against his will, as his fingerprints match the set police found on the broken power cord that killed Peter. A nurse named Ellen  tells him his name is "Adrian"; however, he insists his name is "Andrew", because he remembers his mother calling him "Andrew". Not knowing if Ellen will believe him or not, he is hesitant about telling her what he remembers about the cult. Ellen does believe him, and she helps him escape. When Guy is notified of Andrew\'s escape from the hospital, he fears Andrew may follow him and kill him in a fit of rage. Whilst on the run, Andrew and Ellen stop at a motel, where she seduces him. She then admits to him that she is a cult member, and she drugs and rapes him. He apparently falls asleep having a terrible nightmare of Ellen as a type of harpy that tears at his chest. When Andrew later wakes up and goes outside looking for Ellen, a speeding car tries to run him down. Andrew manages to get out of the way; however, Ellen is hit. When the car crashes, Andrew discovers that Guy, who died in the collision, was the driver of the car. Confused and scared, Andrew runs away into the night. The film finishes with Roman and Minnie sitting in the waiting room of a hospital to visit their pregnant granddaughter. After the doctor informs them that the pregnancy should continue as normal, it is revealed that a pregnant Ellen has survived. During the end credits, Ellen is seen giving birth to Andrew\'s baby, Rosemary\'s son\'s baby.'] ['When a naïve young Dorian Gray  arrives in a train to Victorian London, he is swept into a social whirlwind by the charismatic Lord Henry Wotton , who introduces Gray to the hedonistic pleasures of the city. Lord Henry\'s friend, society artist Basil Hallward , paints a portrait of Gray to capture the full power of his youthful beauty. When the portrait is unveiled, Gray makes a flippant pledge: he would give anything to stay as he is in the picture—even his soul. Gray meets and falls in love with young budding actress Sibyl Vane . After a few weeks, he proposes marriage to her, but after Lord Henry tells Gray that having children is "the beginning of the end", he takes Gray to a brothel. This breaks Sibyl\'s heart as Gray leaves her; drowning herself soon after. Gray learns of this next day from her brother "Jim" , who tells Gray that Sybil was pregnant. Jim then tries to kill Gray before being restrained and carried off by the authorities. Gray\'s initial grief disappears as Lord Henry persuades him that all events are mere experiences and without consequence, and his hedonistic lifestyle worsens, distancing him from a concerned Hallward. Gray goes home to find the portrait of himself warped and twisted and realises that his pledge has come true; while the portrait ages, its owner\'s sins are shown as physical defects on the canvas. The chaos of the portrait of Gray starts, leading him to brutally kill Hallward after telling him his secret, dumping the body in the River Thames. Having left London to travel for many years, Gray returns to London and during the welcome-back party the guests are surprised to see that he has not aged at all. He becomes close to Lord Henry\'s daughter, Emily , a member of the UK suffragette movement, despite Lord Henry\'s distaste for such a relationship due to Gray\'s lifestyle and unnatural appearance, Emily having provided Lord Henry with a greater moral focus. Although Gray appears genuinely interested in changing his ways as he spends time with Emily, matters are complicated when he is confronted by James, still seeking revenge for his sister\'s death; despite Gray\'s attempts to drive off his suspicions by pointing out his apparent age, James nevertheless deduces Gray\'s true identity, only to be killed by a train during the chase in the London Underground. As Gray makes arrangements to leave London with Emily, Lord Henry\'s study of old photographs makes him remember the time when he teased Gray to deal with the devil for eternal youth and beauty at the cost of his soul. Breaking into Gray\'s house as Gray and Emily are making plans to leave together, Lord Henry discovers the concealed portrait, but is interrupted by Gray before he can uncover it. Although Gray attempts to convince Lord Henry that he still cherishes his friendship and genuinely loves his daughter, Lord Henry discovers a stained scarf of Basil\'s in a box, prompting Gray to angrily declare that he is what Lord Henry has made him, the personification of the life he preached but never dared practise. Full of anger and grief, Gray attempts to strangle Lord Henry, but is distracted by Emily\'s call long enough for Lord Henry to knock him aside and expose the portrait. Disgusted and horrified at the twisted sight on the canvas, Lord Henry throws a lit lamp at the portrait, causing it to catch fire, subsequently locking the gate of the attic, to ensure Gray and the painting are destroyed, before his daughter sees the ruckus as she pleads with Gray for the key. Gray, after seeing her and realising that he really loves her, turns his back as Lord Henry drags his daughter out of the house, his last words being to assure Emily that she has his whole heart. Resolving to end it all, Gray stabs the painting with a poker, causing his body to age the years that it has never suffered, Gray charging at the portrait to fully impale it as his years catch up to him before the attic is consumed by an explosion. A few months later, scarred from the explosion and after attempting to reconcile with Emily through Agatha over the phone, Lord Henry heads to his attic where he keeps the now-youthful portrait of Gray, grimly noting that nobody will look at it now. As Lord Henry leaves, the portrait\'s eyes glow, suggesting that Gray\'s soul may still be within the portrait even after his death.'] ["Five years have passed since Freddy Krueger was seemingly defeated. A new family, the Walshes, have moved into the former home of Nancy Thompson. The son, Jesse, happens to move into Nancy's old room. He eventually begins to have nightmares of Krueger demanding that Jesse kill for him using Jesse as a host body to come back to life in the real world. Jesse's girlfriend, Lisa, finds Nancy's old diary in Jesse's closet in which she had been keeping track of her nightmares and her encounters with Freddy. Reading the diary strikes a chord with Jesse as he is experiencing similar nightmares himself. He goes to his parents in a panic, but they argue and Jesse storms out. Jesse later finds himself walking the streets late at night and walks into a bar where he runs into his gym coach. His coach takes him back to the gym to run laps as detention. The coach has Jesse hit the showers while he goes back to his office. While he is in his office, the shelves begin to come alive, hurling balls and other sports equipment at him. Two ropes grab him by the wrists and drag him into the shower that begins to fill with steam. Freddy appears among the steam and slashes the coach's back, killing him. As the steam clears, Jesse is the one with the glove on his hand, Jesse screams and the scene passes onto Jesse's house. Lisa begins to do some digging and uncovers information about Krueger, including the location of the abandoned power plant where he used to work, and where he brought his victims. Meanwhile, Freddy visits Jesse's younger sister, Angela, but when she wakes up, it's actually Jesse standing there with the glove on his hand. Jesse enlists his classmate, Ron Grady, to watch over him while he sleeps. Once Jesse falls asleep, Grady turns out the lights for himself. As soon as Grady is asleep, Jesse awakens and begins to scream in pain as Krueger begins to claw his way out of him. With the door jammed, Grady is helpless against Krueger, who stabs him to his door and slashes down the inside of his torso, gruesomely killing him. When Krueger looks in the mirror it turns out to be Jesse, with Krueger staring back at him from the mirror. Jesse runs to Lisa's house where she is having a pool party. However, Freddy takes control of Jesse once again and attacks Lisa. Lisa is able to fight off Freddy, who runs from the house and out to the party. Some party guests try to take Freddy down, but are killed immediately. With all the guests cornered against the back fence, he stabs one and throws him through a barbecue. After Lisa saves him from being shot by her father, he vanishes into a fiery ball. Lisa runs to the old power plant, thinking she might save Jesse there. She finds him and tells him that she loves him and that he can fight from the inside. She then removes Freddy's hat and kisses him. Freddy begins to lose control. As the power plant begins to burn to the ground, Freddy himself starts burning. After he dies, the rest of the power plant suddenly extinguishes. Just when Lisa thinks it is all over, Freddy's burnt corpse begins to move and Jesse crawls out of Freddy's ashes. The following Monday, Jesse goes back to school. He climbs the bus, finally relieved that it is all over. When the bus begins traveling too fast, Jesse panics and jumps up, only to find out there is nothing wrong; the bus is coming to its regular stop. As he and Lisa rest at ease, Freddy's hand impales through their friend Kerry's chest, killing her, while Jesse and Lisa scream in horror and the bus speeds off the main road and into the open land, just like Jesse's nightmare at the beginning of the film, as Freddy's evil laugh is heard in the background."] ["The film begins with a young woman being attacked by Deathmask and Hideous Dancer, and her blood being drained. This appears to have no real bearing on the rest of the film. Cassie and Sean, as well as ex-boyfriend Matt and good friend Annabel, decide to go for one last bash before they start at university. The four go to a club situated in an old church, where instead of one's hand being stamped, it is branded. While at the club, Cassie sees two strange figures: a man with a clear, plastic mask  and an imposing man with a scarred face . Deathmask tries to grab her on the dance floor, and she pushes him away and steps outside the club with Sean. In the parking lot, Matt eavesdrops on their conversation. Sean confesses his love for Cassie, who claims she feels the same way, but seems unable to say the words 'I love you' in return. Sean returns to the club to find Annabel, and Matt convinces Cassie to give him a last 'goodbye' kiss. Sean sees this, and reacts badly to it, giving Cassie the silent treatment as they drive away. While he ignores her attempts to explain, Cassie, who is behind the wheel, continually looks away from the road. Eventually, the car crashes, and Cassie's next memory is of being rushed to the hospital. Matt and Annabel are unharmed, but Sean has been killed on impact. During the school term that follows, Cassie has several visions of Sean, as though he isn't really dead. Matt is constantly in her company, and sometimes she mistakes him for Sean. Cassie also has numerous visions of Deathmask and Hideous Dancer, even to the point of seeing Matt and Annabel in their company. On several occasions, she believes she is being chased by the two men, although Annabel and Matt assure her that the incidents are all in her mind. While Deathmask chases her through the campus, Cassie faints, and is rescued by Father Jude, a young priest . Father Jude is sympathetic to her fears, and offers to listen if she ever needs someone to talk to. In an effort to cheer her up, Matt signs Cassie up for a swimming competition. Annabel is constantly trying to get Cassie to leave her dorm room -- specifically, to go dancing at the club. In an aborted effort to drag her along, Annabel introduces Cassie to an androgynous creature named Raven, who seems to have some kind of precognitive powers. Raven claims that Cassie is in the 'wrong place', and that she belongs 'with Sean'. A few nights later, after being chased again, Cassie knocks at the church door, and Father Jude gives her sanctuary. He gives her an amulet depicting St Jude, and encourages her to stay strong, then allows her to sleep in his small room in the church. Upon awakening that morning, Cassie sees that the calendar in the room reads 1981. She enters the office of the attending priest and asks to speak to Father Jude. The attending priest says that Father Jude died in 1981. After the swim competition, which Cassie wins, she is chased through the women's locker room and university pool by Deathmask. Defending herself with the tube of a florescent lamp, she ends up stabbing him in the stomach with it. They fall into the pool, and Cassie flees. She runs into Matt, who claims that there is no one in the pool; indeed, when the two return to the pool, there is no body in the water. Even though she believes that Matt and Annabel are conspiring against her with Deathmask and Hideous Dancer, Cassie requests that Matt take her home to her mother. Matt instead drives Cassie to the club, saying that he wishes to pick up Annabel. Cassie follows him into the club, but gets lost, eventually finding Annabel and Raven in a bathroom. When Raven tells her to leave -- or die -- Cassie makes her way back to the parking lot. In the car with Matt, he drunkenly insists on another 'goodbye forever' kiss. Cassie hits him with a bottle and pushes him out of the car, then drives away. In a scene much like the original car accident, Cassie wrecks the car. She again comes to in the hospital. On a gurney next to her is Raven, who speaks a few words of comfort before dying. Cassie also appears to die, and a priest arrives to perform the Last Rites. Father Jude arrives and takes Cassie's hand, asking if she would be willing to die in order to save Sean's life. Cassie says she would. He then asks her if she would be willing to live for him. Cassie says that she doesn't want to die. After a nightmarish dream, in which Deathmask and Hideous Dancer strangle her with her St Jude medallion, Cassie awakens. The entire film has been a sort of coma-dream: in the original accident, Cassie and Sean survived, while Matt and Annabel were killed. The occupants of the other car -- Raven, Deathmask, and Hideous Dancer -- were also fatally injured. Cassie spent the course of the film in a half-dead, half-living state, wherein those who were killed in the accident attempted to keep her with them. Father Jude, and Cassie's visions of Sean, were what brought her back to life."] ['After playing a pagan ritual on a dare, a group of high school students find themselves trapped inside an old house haunted by their worst nightmares.'] ['Dr. Wrenn ([[David Warner  visits John Trent , a patient in a psychiatric hospital, and asks Trent to recount his story: After exposing an arson-fraud scam, Trent, an insurance investigator, has lunch with a colleague who preps him on his next assignment, investigating a claim made by New York-based Arcane Publishing. During their conversation, Trent is attacked by a man wielding an axe who asks him, "Do you read Sutter Cane?" The man is shot dead by a police officer before he can harm Trent. Trent later meets with Arcane Publishing director Jackson Harglow  who tasks him with investigating the disappearance of popular horror novelist Sutter Cane . Cane vanished days before his latest book was released, and Harglow requests that Trent recover the manuscript for Cane\'s final novel of his popular series. He assigns Cane\'s editor, Linda Styles , to accompany him—Cane\'s agent will be of no help as he was the man with the axe who tried to kill Trent earlier. After reading several of Cane\'s novels for research, Trent experiences vivid nightmares of monsters and deformed people murdering each other with axes. Linda explains the stories are known to cause disorientation, memory loss, and paranoia in "less stable readers." Trent remains skeptical, convinced that the disappearance is merely an elaborate publicity stunt. Trent notices a series of red lines on Cane\'s book\'s covers that, when aligned properly, form the outline of New Hampshire and mark a location alluded to be Hobb\'s End, the fictional setting for many of Cane\'s works. As they set out to find the town, Linda experiences bizarre phenomena during the late-night drive: a boy riding a bicycle whose visage changes as she somehow passes him three times, the yellow road lines vanishing followed by the road itself disappearing, the car driving above thunderhead storm clouds, entering a rustic covered bridge in darkness and inexplicably arriving on the other side at Hobb\'s End in daylight. Trent and Linda search the small town and begin encountering fictional people and landmarks described in Cane\'s novel, including Mrs. Pickman , whose hotel they check into, and the Black Church, described in Cane\'s books as a fount of evil that pollutes the entire town. Trent and Linda watch as a group of townspeople arrive at the Black Church wielding shotguns and torches, demanding Cane return a missing child. Johnny, the son of one of men of the group, suddenly appears in the doorway to the Church, supplanted by Cane himself. The townspeople are then set upon by dogs and driven off. Trent believes the events to be staged, but Linda does not. She admits to Trent that Arcane Publishing\'s claim was indeed a fraud and a stunt to promote Cane\'s book. However, the unusual events and exact replica of Hobb\'s End were never part of the plan. Trent prepares to go back to report to Harglow, but is prevented when Linda steals the car keys. She heads to the Black Church to confront Cane, and is exposed to his final novel, In The Mouth Of Madness, driving her insane. Trent is approached at a bar by Johnny\'s father who warns him to leave before the evil infects him as it has the inhabitants of Hobb\'s End. Trent later returns to the bar and witnesses the man commit suicide with a shotgun as he proclaims to merely be a character written to do it. Outside the bar, a mob of mutated, monstrous-looking townspeople descend upon him with shotguns and torches. He flees to the hotel and discovers that Mrs. Pickman  and Linda have also been altered into mutated versions of their former selves. Trent attempts to drive away from Hobb\'s End but is repeatedly teleported back to the center of town, subsequently crashing while swerving to avoid hitting Linda. He awakens in a confessional where Cane explains that the popularity of his eldritch stories have created a sufficient amount of belief to free an ancient race of monstrous beings that will reclaim the Earth. Cane further reveals that Trent himself is merely a character and has no choice but to return the manuscript of In The Mouth Of Madness to Arcane Publishing, ushering the end of humanity. After giving Trent the manuscript, Cane tears his face open like a piece of paper, ripping a hole that leads into darkness and creating a portal to the dimension of Cane\'s monstrous masters. Trent flees down a long tunnel as monsters chase him and he suddenly finds himself lying on a country road, apparently back in reality. During his return to New York, Trent destroys the manuscript, but it somehow is redelivered to him, prompting Trent to destroy it again and again. Back at Arcane Publishing, Trent relates his experience to Harglow and explains why he has no manuscript to return. Harglow informs him that Linda never existed; Trent was sent alone to find Cane. What is more, Trent himself had delivered the manuscript to Harglow months ago. In The Mouth Of Madness has been on sale for weeks with a movie adaptation set to release soon. Trent suffers a psychotic break and is arrested after he murders a reader of the newly released novel with an axe, asking him "Do you like the book?" Dr. Wrenn, after listening to Trent recount his story, concludes that Trent\'s story answers nothing and leaves. That night, amidst a thunderstorm, Trent sees disturbing shadows flicker on the wall and hears human and inhuman screams echo throughout the hospital. Trent wakes the following day to find his cell door torn from its hinges and the residents of the hospital slaughtered. He departs as an abandoned ambulance\'s radio announces that the world has been overrun with mutant creatures and outbreaks of suicide and mass murder. Trent goes to see the In the Mouth of Madness metafilm only to discover that he is the \'star\' of the film. As he watches his previous actions play out on screen, Trent bursts into hysterical laughter/crying, leaving the exact nature of reality uncertain.'] ['Ting-yin, a young novelist, is struggling to come up with a followup to her best-selling trilogy of romance novels. She has not even started on the book yet and her agent has already announced that the next title, The Recycle, will deal with the supernatural. After drafting her first chapter, she stops and deletes the file from her computer. She then starts seeing strange, unexplainable things and finds that she is experiencing the supernatural events that she described in her novel-to-be.'] ['Following the grisly suicide of the U.S. Ambassador to Great Britain , 32-year-old international conglomerate CEO Damien Thorn  is appointed in his place, an office his adoptive father Robert Thorn once held. Unlike the previous Omen films, Damien is aware of his unholy lineage and of his destiny. An alignment of the stars in the Cassiopeia constellation causes the generation of a \'superstar\', described as a second Star of Bethlehem. Thorn realizes it is a sign of the Second Coming of Christ and orders all boys in England born on the morning of March 24, 1982  to be killed in order to prevent the Christ Child\'s return to power. One of Thorn\'s disciples, Dean, attempts to hide that his own son was born on that date. Thorn has also become romantically involved with journalist Kate Reynolds , a relationship which puts his plans for political dominion on hold. But Damien is not deterred and focuses his attention on her young son Peter , whom Thorn takes as a disciple, manipulating the boy\'s desire for a father figure. Meanwhile, Father DeCarlo  and six priests hunt for Thorn, hoping to kill him before he can find and destroy the Christ Child. They are armed with the seven daggers of Megiddo, the only ancient holy weapons that can harm the Antichrist. However, Damien systematically eliminates each of the priests until only DeCarlo remains. Damien senses that the "Christ Child"- Jesus returning to Earth a second time- will be born on March 24. Throughout England, all male infants born on March 24th are executed by Thorn\'s disciples. The last is the child of Dean and his wife Barbara. Damien confronts Dean about Barbara talking with DeCarlo, and demands that he kill his son. Dean refuses and flees. Meanwhile, Thorn\'s dog threatens the child, but Barbara drives it away. Then she has a vision of her son as a burnt offering. This causes her to fall under Damien\'s control and she picks up an iron. Shortly afterwards Dean enters the house where he is killed by Barbara. Finally, DeCarlo tells Reynolds that the Christ Child is out of his reach, in spite of Thorn\'s efforts. In hopes of getting her son back, she agrees to take Thorn to the Christ Child in exchange for Peter. This is part of DeCarlo\'s plan to lure him into a trap. He hopes to ambush Damien and catch him off guard, since his attention will be directed towards confronting Christ. The plan backfires when Damien spots DeCarlo first and uses Peter as a human shield against the dagger. As Peter lies dying, Damien strangles the stunned Father DeCarlo. In a desperate bid to salvage his waning power, Damien calls out for Christ to appear before him. As he does, Kate sneaks up behind Damien with one of the daggers and stabs him in the back, releasing a wail of demonic agony. After Damien dies, his body is seen lying on the ground with Kate standing over it. In the foreground, DeCarlo reappears carrying Peter\'s body and hands him to Kate, who was praying. The film ends with scripture of Revelation chapter 21, verse 4 indicating that when Christ returns to earth, peace will reign for all who faithfully awaited the Lord\'s return.'] ['John Ellman  has been framed for murder by a gang of racketeers. He is unfairly tried and despite the fact that his innocence has been proven, he is sent to the electric chair and executed. Dr. Evan Beaumont  retrieves his dead body and revives it, as part of his experiments to reanimate a dead body and discover what happens to the soul after death. Dr. Beaumont\'s use of a mechanical heart to revive the patient foreshadows modern medicine\'s mechanical heart to keep patients alive during surgery. Although John Ellman has no direct knowledge of anyone wishing to frame him for the murder before he is executed, he gains an innate sense of knowing those who are responsible after he is revived. Ellman takes no direct action against his framers; however, he seeks them out, wishing to know why they had him killed. Each dies a horrible death, and in the end it is their own guilt that causes their deaths. Confronting the last two villains, Ellman is shot. Having fulfilled his divine mission to bring about justice, he dies, just before he would have explained death and the afterlife to the curious Dr. Beaumont. Beaumont is warned not to continue his experiments, citing the Biblical Scripture, "For the LORD thy God is a jealous God ."'] ['In 1913, in Carlton, Pennsylvania , the cruel owner of the Carlton mine exploits poor immigrant children. In order to excavate a new shaft quickly, he employs a dynamite charge, but the explosion causes the mine to collapse, burying a large group of the children alive. Following his later trial for wilfully causing the death of his workers, Carlton is acquitted and the mine closed down. In present day, eighty years later, Karen Tunny has just lost her husband after a long period of terminal disease and has inherited his birthhome near the since-abandoned Carlton mine. She moves to the house with her daughters, Sarah and Emma. The three stop by the local market for supplies and are told by Walter, the shopkeeper, that he doesn\'t deliver to the area they live in. While driving, Karen has a near miss with a man crossing the road. She exits the car, looking for the man, but he\'s nowhere to be found. They arrive at the house and Sarah points out the blood on the door while Karen declares it\'s just "paint." When Emma hears children giggling, she leaves the house, following the sound of it. Karen goes out looking for Emma and finds her in an old mine. As they try to find their way back to the house, it becomes nightfall and they get lost. They find a house, which is occupied by Hanks, and enter. Karen is advised by Hanks to stay at home during the night, and he also tells her that there is no need to thank him for the blood smeared on his and the Tunny\'s door. William Carlton, the last surviving heir of the Carlton estate, which has owned the mine since 1913, is hungrily devouring property and kicking people off his own property. Meanwhile, the zombie children begin to kill, which is dismissed among the community as disappearances, though it is hinted that most of the community is aware of the presence of the children. As it turns out, the Tunnys and Hanks, are relatives of the zombie children, who leave blood relatives alive while killing all others. Emma, who has had friendly contact with a less-violent zombie named Mary, informs her mother that the zombies won\'t eat her, and that Mary would not directly hurt her mother , but passes on the warning that the other children might. Karen finds some old family photo albums in the basement that contain pictures of her late husband, as well as the Tunny and Hanks children who died in the mine disaster, thus revealing that the family is related to some of the children who had died. Karen and Sarah leave the house to go look for Emma. As they exit the mine, not being able to find Emma, they become surrounded by a dozen of the children. They escape, with the children pursuing them, and find a car passing through with Carlton inside. They enter, telling him to drive, but the tires are slashed before they can pull away. Karen and Sarah run to Hanks\' house, unsure of what to do. Soon enough, Karen figures out that Hanks\' blood has a supposed repellent effect on the zombie children. As both Hanks and Carlton attempt to shoot the children, they realize the bullets are ineffective, and run to the barn. Hanks realizes that, as he and Emma are direct blood relatives, it turns out Mary has an older brother that\'s also a Tunny, and Karen is in some way protected by Emma\'s relationship with Mary. The children are really after Carlton, as they blame his family for the mining accident that killed them. After Carlton is killed by the children, Emma remarks that they won\'t be hurting anyone anymore. At the end, the Tunny family drives away and reveals that the house has not been sold. Now, Mary lives in the house, with the bear that Emma gave her.'] ['{{plot}} The film opens with a Great Western express speeding out of Box Tunnel on route to Cornwall. The train\'s passengers include Herbert and Edna, a young couple travelling to Truro to be married, Miss Bourne, a West London spinster visiting evacuated relatives, Tommy Gander, an overenthusiastic Vaudeville-style comedian and entertainer headed for the Pier Pavilion at Newquay to put on a show, Dr Sterling, a locum for a doctor in Redruth, Richard G Winthrop and his cousin Jackie, also heading for Truro, and Teddy Deakin. Just as they are passing Teignmouth, the communication cord is pulled and the train stops - only for the guard and passengers to find that Gander has lost his hat and is running back to retrieve it. Ignorant of the delay this has caused, he returns to the train and comes across Jackie Winthrop in her compartment. Gander tries to make conversation with her, but Teddy has his eye on Jackie and is quick to try and send him packing - at one point he insinuates that Gander is in a first class carriage with a third class ticket, whereupon Gander jokingly retorts by saying he has a platform ticket. Richard has no time for either of them, so they both annoy him by pacing back and forth outside his compartment. Gander makes silly faces until Richard loses patience and shuts the blinds over their windows. The train arrives at Fal Vale Junction, Cornwall. Teddy and Gander are quick to help Jackie with her luggage. Gander offers to share his compartment, but Teddy points out that they are travelling first class, and that Richard dislikes the comedian. Instead they set about helping Miss Bourne, who initially mistakes a carriage window for a door, with her luggage, including her pet parrot, Polly. Just before the train leaves, Gander realises he has forgotten about his basket containing props and costumes. He is annoyed when the guard tells him he had thrown it out of the van. Once the train has left, the passengers meet Fal Vale\'s stationmaster Saul Hodgkin. He tells them that the last Truro-bound train has gone, and that there won\'t be another until morning; he is just about to lock up for the night. Upon Richard\'s irate prompting, and knowing that he has to rehearse at Newquay the next morning, Gander tries to charter a special, but Saul refuses to make arrangements. As he is preparing his bicycle, rain starts to fall, and the passengers make for the station waiting room, taking out their frustrations on Gander for his lost hat. Saul tries to make it clear that "You can\'t stay here", but the passengers insist on staying until transport can be arranged. Eventually Saul telephones for a bus, but for some reason is unable to requisition one. He suggests that they walk to the local village, but the passengers object upon hearing that it is four miles away. In the meantime, Gander has rescued his basket from the rain, and borrows the ticket office as a changing room. In spite of the passengers\' firm decision to stay put, Saul cannot bring himself to leave them alone, and neither does he wish to stay with them - his reason being that the station is haunted...... In 1897, a branch line was run from Fal Vale Junction to an old port, crossing the river on a swing bridge at the other end of a tunnel close to the station. The swing bridge, worked by a wheel on the platform, was kept open for china clay boats, but was closed whenever trains had to cross it. One day, some locals chartered a special train to take them home, and the then stationmaster, Ted Holmes, was kept on late night duty to close the bridge for it. At eleven o\'clock, he went to close the bridge, but he had a heart attack before he could finish doing it. He tried to get back to his office and warn Truro about the bridge, but his heart failed and he collapsed with his lamp still burning in his hand. With Holmes dead and the bridge still open, there was no way of preventing a crash. Although something warned the train driver, Ben Isaacs, of the danger, he was unable to stop and the train plunged through the open bridge into the river. The branch line was supposedly closed afterwards, and the bridge has always remained in the open position. Ever since that day, Saul explains, there have been occasions when a train is heard desperately trying to pull up near the station. It never arrives anywhere, and neither does it start from Truro, and it is said to kill anyone who looks upon it. "If it be a natural thing," he asks, "where do it come from...where do it go?" With that, Saul reluctantly leaves the passengers, warning them not to look if they hear a train that night. Miss Bourne is still shaken after hearing his story, but Richard sceptically passes it off as nonsense. Gander has been listening in on the story too, and makes a great fuss of it; in order to take his mind off things, Richard starts a game of chess with Dr Sterling. Gander tries to liven things up by singing "The Seaside Band", but this ends prematurely when Richard loses his temper and throws his gramophone out onto the track. In a surprisingly calm act of retaliation, Gander picks up the chess set and throws it into the fireplace. After another few moments, Miss Bourne hears something in the station buffet. Richard goes to investigate, followed by Gander who pretends that someone is trying to murder him, but it turns out there is nothing to worry about. Gander then notices that Miss Bourne has some tea with her, and they decide to make some up for refreshment. Teddy sends Gander to fetch some water while he and Jackie prepare to make the tea, but the only source turns out to be a water crane on the platform. In order to stay dry, Gander improvises a raincoat from a tablecloth and a sheet of tarpaulin, but while obtaining his supply of water he finds the old bridge wheel. Curious as to what might happen, he tries to turn it, but the wheel is chained and padlocked, and he can barely move it. He gives up and takes the water into the buffet, where he makes mention of the wheel to Teddy and Jackie before "tea-urning the gas on" in a rather flashy fashion. Again he tries to start conversation with Jackie, but Teddy interferes again and sends him back into the waiting room, where he tries in vain to entertain the other passengers with ghost stories. Teddy and Jackie soon bring the tea through to the waiting room, and the passengers share out what little food they have to make a meal of it. During their midnight meal, Gander acts as if Ted Holmes\' ghost is lying in the doorway to the branch line platform, repeatedly stumbling as if the ghost had tripped him up. In the end he moves the "ghost" out of harm\'s way and offers to provide a dessert from a chocolate machine outside. When he returns, however, he finds to his disappointment that he has bought several boxes of matches. As he is telling a story of an accompanying passenger smoking a cigarette until it burned through his lip , they hear footsteps outside. Richard opens the door to the branch line platform, and a seriously ill Saul Hodgkin collapses into the room. Gander rushes outside with his lamp and raincoat to fill a glass with water from the water crane while Richard, Teddy and Dr Sterling carry Saul into the ticket office. By the time Gander arrives back, Dr Sterling pronounces Saul dead. When Edna hears about it, she scared to stay at the station with a corpse. Edna persuades her reluctant fiancé, Herbert, that they would be better off trying to get back to her mother. Teddy tries to call the police, but the line appears to be down. Miss Bourne is in a dreadful state after she fainted when Saul collapsed into the room, so Gander borrows a bottle of brandy from Dr Sterling to soothe her nerves. Although a strict temperance teetotaler, Miss Bourne drinks the whole lot and becomes noticeably drunk. Teddy, Jackie and Gander bring her through to the buffet to sleep it off, during which Gander tries and fails comically at a trick he had seen at the Hippodrome where all the crockery stays on the table when he pulls the rug off. Shortly after, Herbert and Edna burst into the waiting room with only half their luggage. A knock is heard, and they open the door to reveal a terrified young woman in black. The stranger pleads for help, saying that someone is coming for her, but there is something she has to see. The passengers are confused, particularly when the young woman acts as if they know what she is talking about - until Teddy sees a car coming down the road. As they watch, the car spins off the road and crashes into a tree, so Teddy, accompanied by Gander and Dr Sterling, go to see what has happened. The driver of the car is unhurt, but his car is badly damaged. It turns out that he had skidded on Herbert and Edna\'s luggage, including a fender donated them by the owner of a furniture shop. They return to the waiting room with the battered luggage and the driver of the car, who introduces himself as Price and explains that he has come in search of his sister Julia. He adds that she suffers from delusions, and is normally kept under observation. Julia overhears, and emerges from the buffet protesting that he is lying. Price further explains that she once thought she had seen the ghost train, and this was such a shock to her that has retained a fascination for it ever since, and experiences compulsions to try and see it again. He is curious, however, as to how they heard about the ghost train; the passengers reply that Saul Hodgkin had told them, but is lying dead in the ticket office. Price goes to take a look, but Saul\'s body has mysteriously vanished, and his desk was just the way he had left it earlier. When they explain to Price what had happened, Julia insinuates that it was actually Ted Holmes. Dr Sterling suggests that Julia remains at the station until she realises that the ghost train doesn\'t exist. Price reluctantly concedes, but insists before he leaves that Julia comes back with him as soon as he can find a car. Some time after he leaves, a signal bell is heard to ring in the ticket office, followed by the shrieking whistle of an approaching train. Teddy and Richard try to open the doors and get a look at the train, but the doors won\'t open. As it thunders through the station, Julia smashes a window to get a look at the train, but faints the moment she sees it. Dr Sterling makes her comfortable on one of the waiting room benches and requests for a glass of water. Teddy and Gander, who suspect trouble, take this opportunity to go outside to do some sleuthing. The rain has stopped, but Gander is surprised to find that Saul\'s lamp has vanished too. Further surprise comes when Teddy finds the bridge has been closed - then they hear singing from the tunnel mouth, and look to see someone wandering towards them. Julia hears it from the waiting room, and claims that Ben Isaacs, the sole survivor of the accident, is coming back just as he had after the accident - out of his mind and singing "Rock of Ages". Teddy knows better, however, and shoots at the "ghost", causing it to flee back into the tunnel. He and Gander run after it, but Teddy spots a sheet of cloth with drops of blood on it, and heads back to the waiting room. Gander doesn\'t realise Teddy\'s distraction until he is some way into the tunnel. Price has managed to requisition a bus, but is perplexed to hear from Richard that "some idiot\'s been fooling around with a gun outside". At that very same moment, Teddy re-enters the room and holds everyone at gunpoint, locking the doors as he does so. He shows them the bloodstained cloth and begins to explain about the hoax behind the ghost train; someone has taken advantage of the accident and a local superstition to make their job easier, except that it didn\'t work on him and his fellow passengers. This ghost train, he adds, "happens to be as real as the Plymouth Express". But before he can elaborate on this, Jackie points out that Gander was the reason for them being here in the first place. Teddy is taken off guard by this, allowing Richard to punch him hard in the jaw and knock him out. They carry him to the bus with their luggage, and are just about to start away when Gander arrives in time to catch it. He notices Teddy lying unconscious next to him and tries to bring him round. When at last Teddy comes to, he is furious with Richard for what he had done, for now there will be no-one to intercept the train on its return journey. Julia insists that "the ghost train never comes back", but Teddy counters that it is more obliging in that makes a return journey. Gander remarks that if it is a ghost train, it won\'t matter if the bridge is open - and points out that that was what he had done a few moments back. Dr Sterling suddenly moves towards the front of the bus at this point and orders the driver to stop, while Julia and her brother hold everyone at gunpoint. He tells the driver that the bridge is open, and orders him to turn back so that they can warn the train. Meanwhile, guns are being loaded aboard the "ghost train" from a nearby beach. As it turns out, Saul Hodgkin is very much alive and in the thick of the business. He flags the train off and climbs aboard as they start away with their illegal cargo. On the bus, Teddy explains to Richard that the "ghost train" is really a gunrunners\' train being used by Fifth Columnists sympathetic to the Nazi movement, with Price as their leader. In the distance, Julia can see the train on the last curve before the bridge. Price and Sterling order the driver to stop, and Price heads down the embankment with Julia and the driver to try and stop the train, but it pays little heed to them as it hurtles towards the bridge. Just as Sterling is trying to retrieve Teddy\'s gun from Richard, Gander sounds a buzzer in the driver\'s cab, startling the doctor and enabling Teddy to knock him unconscious. Taking Sterling\'s gun with them, the passengers make their escape. At the same time, the driver of the ghost train realises too late that the bridge is open, and applies his brakes. But there is nothing he can do to stop in time, and the train takes a nose-dive from the bridge and crashes into the river. Afterwards, Teddy discreetly explains to Gander that, "confidentially", he isn\'t whom he makes himself out to be, indicating that he may officially have been sent to investigate the case for British Intelligence. Richard admits that he has been rather foolish, and apologises to both Teddy and Gander. Miss Bourne then staggers out of the buffet with a terrible headache. Thankful that, as far as she is concerned, "nothing exciting has happened", she makes for the special train they have ordered while Teddy and Gander look on in amusement.']
