Pellaindi Kani has the uninteresting answers. Pellaindi Kani is a forgettable project of EVV. The man that has given so many comedy hits neither makes a comedy nor a tragedy of Pellaindi Kani. There is a severe draught of imagination. The movie doesn't appeal even to the low IQ audience. Allari Naresh acts vaguely in a mentally challenged role. Sunil is cast in a good role. He is the friend and caretaker of Allari Naresh. His capabilities are not exploited in any way. Krishna Bhagwan's comic capabilities also lie unutilized. Kamalinee Mukherjee and Bhanupriya get some good scenes. Harish kumar of Prema Qaidi fame gets better scope to emote than Allari Naresh. And he acts consummately; other that that there is not much in the movie to write about. The movie opened to a mostly empty theatre. The theatres wherever this movie is running will only get emptier in the coming few days. Hope EVV works hard on his next project and Allari Naresh to improve his acting skills."] ['The storyline follows an actor named Ben and a group of six unrelated men and women have been implanted with false memories that they are his family.

The advantage of the matrilineal system was that the property was enjoyed by successors of the women in the family. The women were educated and bold. They enjoyed freedom in all respects. The mother in the family was stronger than the father. But by the end of this system, in the 1940s, women lost all their powers and soon became \'slaves\' in the hands of a feudal male-dominated society. The movie exposes the complexities of a period of transition from matrilineal to patrilineal. "Ozhimuri" means \'divorce record\' in both Tamil and Malayalam. In the matrilineal system, women were free to divorce their husbands if they were not having a sound relationship. The \'ozhimuris\' or small palm-leaf pieces recording divorces of couples still stand testimony to the freedom, which women enjoyed those days. The movie lays open the ego clashes and complexities of a period through the eyes of its lead character Thanupillai , who witnesses the tale of three women, his mother, wife and son\'s wife.'] ['Dhanyam tells about the virtues of Kerala village life and culture.{{cite web}}<ref nameതൃശ്ശൂരിന്റെ സ്വപ്നമായ ധന്യം പ്രദര്\u200dശനത്തിനൊരുങ്ങി|url586|publisherMarch 17, 2012}}'] ['A piano tuner on holiday in San Francisco, Kyoko , meets Tetsuo , a Japanese layabout on the run from his debts in Japan.

She is trained to use her craft of fire to hunt down witches. Witchcraft is a genetic trait, dormant within a number of individuals within the human population. Powers can be "awakened" in these dormant human "seeds" at any time, which seems to also drive the awakened witch into various forms of homicidal madness or sociopathy. Trained hunters, craft-users or "seeds" themselves that have not become full witches, are needed to keep watch over "seeds" and hunt those whose abilities become active, serving in secret organizations, such as the parent branch "Solomon" and the "STN-J" branch in Japan, as self-appointed witch police to curtail the use of witchcraft in society, and to keep the witch kind a secret from the public. Even the police, who cooperate with STN-J in abnormal criminal cases, do not know what STN-J does. The series begins when Robin arrives in Japan to gain information for Solomon headquarters about a fabled item that holds the "secrets of the craft", while acting undercover as a new hunter to the STN-J in their efforts to capture witches. It is hinted that she subconsciously understands something of the STN-J\'s use of Orbo. Orbo is a green liquid that negates witch abilities. STN-J\'s hunters carry small vials of it on necklaces in the shape of a cross as a form of protection against their targets\' craft. Hunters also carry air pistols which fire darts or pellets of Orbo that dampen witch powers when it enters the bloodstream of the target witch. Hunters who are craft-users or seeds can use Orbo with little ill effects, although their own powers are reportedly diminished while using it. Robin, a craft-user herself, says that she will not keep Orbo on her because she says it is "disgusting" . As the series goes on, Robin grows increasingly uncomfortable with her role in hunting and capturing other witches. She begins to question the treatment they receive while incarcerated in the mysterious "Factory". After the discovery of "secrets of the craft," she is entrapped and attacked twice by "witch bullets". Subsequently, the STN-J is attacked, presumably for "secrets of the craft," although the Solomon attack was carried out to find what Zaizen, the director of the STN-J, was planning. Robin begins to worry that she will become a target and grows to suspect that her partner Amon will hunt her. Eventually, Robin does become a target of Solomon and labeled a witch, becoming "hunted". In the end, Robin finds out more about her craft and that of witches than she knew at the beginning. Initially, the series appears to take a "monster of the week" approach.

This scene is followed by the state funeral of his predecessor, Margaret Thatcher. Urquhart publicly praises Thatcher as his mentor, but privately begrudges her record as the longest-serving Prime Minister in recent history,The serial refers to Thatcher as Britain\'s longest-serving Prime Minister, when she was actually the seventh-longest serving. The novel does not contain this mistake, as it accurately refers to Thatcher as the longest-serving post-war Prime Minister. a record that Urquhart himself is soon to surpass. To "leave my mark on Europe," Urquhart champions a treaty resolving the Cyprus dispute between Greek and Turkish Cypriots. While boundaries are fixed by five international judges, Urquhart &ndash; prompted by his wife Elizabeth &ndash; is secretly working to bring offshore oil deposits under the control of the Turkish authorities on the island so that a Turkish-British consortium will have the right to exploit them; an executive of the consortium has promised to provide for Urquhart\'s retirement fund in return. Urquhart also has a personal connection to Cyprus. As a nineteen-year-old British Army lieutenant serving there in 1956, he killed two young men of the EOKA terrorist group while trying to get information from them. Urquhart has frequent nightmares and flashbacks of this event, and also of the murders of Mattie Storin and others, shown in the previous serials. Returning to London on the motorway from a meeting with the oil company executive, Urquhart\'s car is rammed by another car containing three drunken louts. The attackers are quickly killed by his security staff. Urquhart sustains minor head injuries in the collision, but his life is not endangered. Lying in his hospital room, Urquhart experiences again his recurring nightmare about the killings in Cyprus. When Elizabeth arrives at the hospital, he is delirious and confuses the incident on the motorway with the incident in Cyprus. Tom Makepeace, the Foreign Secretary and Deputy Prime Minister, chairs a cabinet meeting while Urquhart is in hospital, and it is announced that the motorway incident was simply the result of "road rage." Urquhart considers Makepeace &ndash; the actual negotiator of the Cyprus treaty &ndash; as a potential challenger, although he doesn\'t take the threat very seriously, considering him "not a fighter" but "a sentimental dreamer". Meanwhile, the brother of the two Greek Cypriots killed by Urquhart decades ago is now living in London. Unknown to Urquhart, he witnessed their deaths and recognises Urquhart as the soldier who killed them. He asks his daughter Maria to investigate, using the pretext that he wishes to find the location where they are buried in order to arrange a proper memorial, but it is revenge rather than mourning that is on his mind. He asks himself, in the event he is able to confirm that Urquhart is their killer, "How will I punish him?" Maria\'s search of government records finds a report written by the soldier who killed her uncles, but the name of the soldier is deleted. She approaches Urquhart, who appears to be welcoming and eager to help. Unknown to her, he arranges that documents revealing his involvement be excluded from a coincidental declassification of records relating to the British involvement in Cyprus. But he also confides the truth to his wife Elizabeth. As in the previous serials, Urquhart chooses a female protégé . He appoints the ambitious backbencher Claire Carlsen as his Parliamentary Private Secretary. Claire also happens to be Makepeace\'s lover. When Urquhart asks her advice about Makepeace, however, she tells Urquhart to "get rid of him." Encouraged by Claire, Urquhart enrages Makepeace by making a speech in the House of Commons suggesting that Britain should not adopt the European currency, but that Europe should instead adopt English as its official language. When Makepeace remonstrates with Urquhart, Urquhart tells him his tenure as Foreign Secretary is over and offers him the Department of Education in a Cabinet reshuffle. The furious Makepeace resigns from the government, crosses the floor, and emerges as the prime minister\'s main adversary in parliament. He also challenges Urquhart for the leadership of the Conservative Party and forces him into a second ballot. Although Claire ends her sexual relationship with Makepeace, she continues to talk to him privately and encourages him to fight Urquhart. She also advises Maria to take her case to Makepeace, who repeatedly raises the cover-up in parliament. At Makepeace\'s suggestion, Claire purloins the original report on the Cyprus killings with Urquhart\'s name revealed from the secret government archive where it is stored, but Urquhart\'s bodyguard, Corder &ndash; informed by the archive clerk &ndash; seizes the document from her. Makepeace\'s leadership challenge has attracted enough support to convince Urquhart that his position is in jeopardy. He decides to leak information regarding the oil deposits in the territory awarded to the Turks in order to stir up a conflict on Cyprus and trigger an international incident that requires Britain to intervene so that he can use as "our Falklands" to unite Britain under his leadership. In reaction, Greek nationalists kidnap a British diplomat, and later also the Greek Cypriot President. Urquhart orders a British military intervention. Though initially successful, the intervention later results in the death of civilians, including young schoolgirls, largely because of the prime minister\'s drastic orders. Urquhart\'s support plummets, and when he proves unwilling to accept responsibility for the deaths, or even to express sympathy for the victims, many MPs openly call on him to resign. While Urquhart appears defiant, his wife is worried, and she consults Corder for advice on how to save him. Corder advises "drastic measures", and informs her that he has sent a copy of Mattie Storin\'s tape, revealing Urquhart\'s role in her death, to Makepeace. Makepeace confronts the prime minister and announces that he will publish the tape, but not before Urquhart has achieved his aim of surpassing Margaret Thatcher\'s record. After this, Urquhart again meets Maria. The incriminating Cyprus report has been sent to Maria\'s father anonymously - presumably by Corder - and Maria vows to publish it. After this, Urquhart despairs, but Elizabeth consoles him: "We can be safe still!" and hints at a ploy by Corder. At the unveiling of the Margaret Thatcher memorial, on the day when Urquhart surpasses her record, a sniper in Corder\'s services appears on a rooftop and shoots the prime minister . Elizabeth had arranged for his assassination as the only way to preserve his reputation . Urquhart dies in her arms, while Corder offers his services to Makepeace, the apparent successor.'] ['The cartoon series revolved around Tennessee Tuxedo the penguin , and his best friend Chumley the Walrus . The pair lived  at the Megapolis Zoo, under the control of the ill-tempered zoo director Stanley Livingston , and his zookeeper assistant Flunky . It was on one of Stanley’s journeys that Tennessee met Stanley. Actually, it was Chumley that Stanley wanted, as Chumley was at the South Pole. Thus Chumley was a one of a kind: a South Pole walrus. Tennessee agreed to accompany Chumley and Stanley back to the zoo. At the zoo, Tennessee and Chumley had many friends to help them out, such as Yakkety Yak  and Baldy the eagle  amongst other inhabitants of the zoo. Three episodes also featured Howler, a dog that Tennessee got from his Uncle Admiration. At first, Stanley was against Tennessee having Howler on zoo grounds until Howler saved Stanley when he fell into a lake upon spying on Tennessee and Chumley\'s housing project for Howler. Tennessee and Chumley also had a big rival, in the form of Jerboa Jump the kangaroo rat . Jerboa later gains a henchman in a boxing tiger named Tiger Tornado . Some of the episodes would center around Tennessee trying to outsmart Jerboa at his own game, and succeeding in the end of course. Tennessee and Chumley were also constantly bedeviled by Rocky Maninoff , a gangster who often called them “bo-bos” and ordered them to do his will at the point of his machine gun. Tennessee and Chumley regularly escaped from the zoo, only to find trouble in the outside world Whenever Tennessee would propose a hare-brained scheme, Chumley was usually skeptical at first. Typically Tennessee would assure the dim-witted Chumley that his superior intelligence would carry the day, often with his catchphrase "Tennessee Tuxedo will not fail!" Chumley typically would respond with his own catchphrase, "Duh, OK Tennessee." When faced with more trouble than they could bear, the pair would turn to their friend Phineas J. Whoopee , the “Man with All the Answers” . Mr. Whoopee, as he was known, was extremely knowledgeable on all subjects, and would frequently lecture the pair on such diverse topics as the physics behind the hot air balloon to how musicians become popular. His lectures were illustrated and animated on the Three Dimensional Blackboard , that he would retrieve out of an avalanche of junk from his overstuffed hallway closet. Other times the pair would have to overcome a personal problem, such as Chumley requiring treatment for a toothache but expressing his fear of the dentist . At the end of each lecture with Mr. Whoopee, Tennessee praised his mentor with the line, “Phineas J. Whoopee, you’re the greatest!” The pair would then attempt to use their newly gained knowledge to get out of the trouble they had created, but would invariably end up in more trouble with Stanley Livingston who typically punished them in different ways ranging from having the police arrest them to making them scrub pots and pans in the Zoo Cafeteria for six months. Stanley even threatened to skin them alive many times and some episodes just end with Stanley chasing Tennessee and Chumley around the Zoo. There were however a few times when they managed to succeed such as a time where the pair  formed a musical group and gained so much popularity that they managed to star in Stanley\'s music show while he was reduced to eating his hat  and the time when they decorated Stanley\'s Christmas Tree. On a Boing podcast, Underdog creator Joe Harris explained that after F.C.C. commissioner Newton Minow declared television a "vast wasteland" in terms of educational material, efforts were made to include education in programming. He added that with Tennessee Tuxedo, Tennessee and Chumley were portrayed as the ones who were being educated, so children would feel that they were not being lectured to; even though in the end, they were. Occasional back segments included The World of Commander McBragg, Klondike Kat, Tooter Turtle, The Hunter, and The King and Odie . For the voice of the “small penguin, who tries but can’t succeed-o,” Don Adams used his already-well-known “clippy” voice characterization, which he said was an exaggeration of actor William Powell’s voice.'] ['The film centres around a forest ranger who confronts illegal timber merchants and contractors on behalf of the impoverished tribal people.

In the opening scene, a dreaded underworld don is brutally hacked to death by unknown assailants. The police arrive at the crime scene and arrest the unknown assailant revealed as the superstar hero of the movie. The murder is revealed to be the handiwork of a novice, Madesha alias Jogi, played by Kannada superstar Shivarajkumar who works in a roadside tea stall. In the meantime, news about the murder reaches the echelons of the underworld. A rival gang of the slain don bails out Madesha from the lock-up and requests him to be their associate. Madesha rejects their offer and returns to his tea stall. An inquisitive trainee journalist Nivedhitha  is eager to know about Madesha and requests an appointment with him. Despite trailing Madesha for several days, she is unable to interview him. Subsequently, she meets an old woman  from a remote village, who has come in search of her lost son. After listening to her story, Nivedhitha assures her that she will locate her son. In a flashback, it is revealed that the old lady\'s son is none other than Madesha. Madesha originally hailed from a village called Singanallur, North Karnataka and lived with his parents. His father  earned his living as a Jogi - a wandering minstrel, who went from one household to another and collected alms in return for singing. Due to the strenuous workload, he falls ill and dies.

His mother dies before even seeing her son. Jogi, who does not know this, dances in front of her dead body. When he discovers that he performed the last rites of his mother without realising it, he is completely broken. On the other hand, the underworld men  and who wanted to hack Jogi to death, also drop arms saying, "Jogi took up arms for his mother, for what reason are we fighting?".

RuPaul stars as Starbooty, a crime fighting federal agent who disposes of villains while getting entangled in romantic liaisons. At the time, RuPaul was still participating in a type of drag known as genderfuck; as such his appearance generally is of a man with feminine makeup and clothes, but no padding or taping to make the body look female. Outside the canon of the actual films, a sketch on RuPaul\'s VH1 talk show continued the storyline of the character of Starbooty with a preview for an alleged new film called "Starbooty in: Take That You Honky Bitch". In 2006 RuPaul used his blog to discuss a film he was in the process of making which he called "The Untitled RuPaul Movie". The film was initially titled Starrbooty: Reloaded but ultimately is just called Starrbooty. The film follows similar plot lines from the previous ones, but contains more sexually explicit content.

Investment bank Lehman Brothers is in trouble after a turbulent six months in which their real estate investments have lost billions of dollars, causing steep drops in Lehman\'s stock. Lehman\'s boss, Dick Fuld , who brought the firm through other crises, is himself growing desperate. Fuld\'s plan to spin off the company\'s bad assets into a separate company does not satisfy investors, and Lehman stock drops by 75% in one week. Fuld\'s only remaining solution is to have Lehman acquired. Both Bank of America and Barclay Bank are interested in purchasing the firm but are dissuaded because so much of Lehman\'s assets are "toxic", worthless. Lehman\'s problems have put the US government in a delicate position. The collapse of a firm of Lehman\'s size would have catastrophic economic repercussions well beyond the firm itself. Because there is no political support for a government bailout of the firm, the government turns to Lehman\'s competitors for help. Late on the afternoon of 12 September, a Friday, the leaders of the top investment banks on Wall Street, Lehman\'s competitors, are summoned to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. American Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson warns the incredulous group that Lehman is not too big to fail and that there will be no bailout using public money. Instead, Paulson cajoles the bank heads to work out some joint plan among themselves to relieve Lehman of its toxic assets, warning them that the steep price they would pay to save Lehman would be easily outweighed by the cost of its failure. He also intimidates the bank heads by reminding them that they too will soon need help. A solution must be found before trading opens in Japan on Monday morning. By Friday evening, Bank of America begins stalling the deal, noting that Lehman\'s valuation puts them "underwater" by billions of dollars. Fuld must now depend on Barclays, and he is clearly growing more desperate. Retaining hopes that Bank of America will change its mind, Fuld has the firm\'s attorney Harvey R. Miller  begin drafting a bankruptcy petition. As Paulson\'s group searches for alternatives, Lehman\'s assets are subject to "valuation" by analysts from other firms. The analysts spend the night poring over boxes of paperwork. Calculation is made extremely difficult because much of the assets are based on collateralized debt obligation  instruments whose value is difficult to assess. Discussion continue at the Fed throughout Saturday with little result. John Thain of Merrill Lynch  pulls out of Paulson\'s bailout group, telling Paulson that his company is in discussions with Bank of America. As they are no longer committed to Lehman, Bank of America is free to consider acquiring Merrill Lynch, which desperately needs the deal. Since the prospect of acquisition makes it less likely that Merrill will need help from the Fed, Thain has little incentive to continue participating in Paulson\'s discussions. As Thain leaves, he learns from Paulson of the Fed\'s plans to bail out AIG, whose credit default swaps insure half of the western world\'s banking system. By Sunday morning, Fuld receives word that Barclays has agreed to acquire Lehman Brothers, saving it. Jubilation is short-lived. Under British law, Barclays cannot guarantee Lehman\'s debts until its own shareholders vote on the matter, and that will not happen until Tuesday – beyond the Monday morning deadline. Paulson reiterates that the Fed will not "back-stop" Lehman, not even for the two days it will take for Barclays\'s shareholders to vote. With no chance of a buyout, Lehman has no choice but to file for bankruptcy. Lehman\'s CFO signs the petition just minutes before the midnight deadline. A devastated Fuld leaves his office as Lehman\'s now unemployed staff cleans out their desks. A voice-over notes that the Fed did bailout firms that faced collapse after Lehman.'] ['Rajan is a detective who has come to investigate the murder of his friend, a newspaper editor.

There, Charlie Brown reveals Joe\'s unfair ways of playing: he only plays beginners, saying he\'s playing for fun until he wins and then he claims it\'s for keeps and takes all their marbles, shocking and angering Joe. Initially Joe wins and takes all of Charlie\'s marbles, but fortunately, Snoopy has two spares. Joe complains, but Charlie Brown claims "his dog, therefor, his marbles", which Joe can\'t turn down. Joe gets one, but then misses. Charlie Brown then shoots and wins the last marble, along with Joe\'s shooter . Charlie Brown makes another bet, if Joe wants his shooter back, they\'ll play for all the marbles. Joe asks why because Charlie Brown only has three marbles and Joe has hundreds. Charlie Brown says that if he misses a single shot, no matter how much he\'s won, Joe gets all the marbles. Joe, feeling unbeatable at that bet, agrees. Charlie Brown wins all the marbles in a single turn, crushing Joe, who is forced to give all the marbles back. Triumphant, Charlie Brown returns home and enjoys seeing Lucy\'s irritation and astonishment learning that he had been a hero. While the credits roll, Snoopy\'s and Woodstock\'s siblings sleep while Woodstock roasts marshmallows and sings. The storyline was an amalgamation of several different series of Peanuts strips; the "Joe Agate" storyline originally appeared in the strip in 1995, and the story involving Peppermint Patty sneaking away from summer school to see Charlie Brown at camp was an adaptation of a series of strips from 1989.'] ["The film begins when a widow comes with her child to a bunglaw to see the laywer of the owner of that bunglaw.The lawyer cheated the lady and capture all their properties.

While attending a Christmas party, David  offers to drive his co-worker, Emily , home. Reluctantly, he allows his friend Corey  to accompany them. On the car ride, Corey forces David to pull up at a local ATM, wanting to get money for pizza. Corey and David enter the ATM to withdraw money, and shortly after, Emily joins them. When the three are about to leave, they turn to see a hooded figure lurking outside. While Corey suggests they return to the car, Emily and David are reluctant, believing the figure to be a robber. Although they are scared, they realize, though later proven wrong by David, that the figure cannot get in without an ATM card. The hooded figure murders a local man walking his dog, prompting the three to call the police, only to realize they had left their cellphones in the car. While the three are panicking inside, the hooded figure cuts off the heater in the ATM booth, effectively making it colder. David decides to reason with the hooded figure, and attempts to give him 500 dollars, valuable earrings, and a watch in return for their safety. While giving the money to the hooded figure, he runs back to the car, attempting to grab Emily\'s phone to alert the police. He is chased to the car, gets the phone and realizes the wires have been cut preventing the car from being driven. The hooded figure then attacks him by smashing out the passenger\'s side window. He escapes the car and is chased back to the ATM booth, unharmed, but drops the cellphone along the way. Emily uses her lipstick to write "HELP" on the ATM booth\'s window. The hooded man takes the phone, the valuables and the wallet from the dead man. As the three begin to freeze, a security guard sees the sign and goes to investigate, but is beaten to death by the hooded figure  in the process, leaving them hopeless. Another man with a similar coat to the killer enters the ATM, but Corey and David manage to kill him by strangling him. They later realize that the man was innocent and was only going to work, because he was the janitor. Corey takes his coat and grows angry and tired and attempts to leave the ATM booth, but is caught and stabbed by the hooded figure. After several more hours freezing in the ATM booth, David and Emily realize Corey is still alive. They both run outside, grab him, and manage to return to the ATM booth before the hooded figure gets to them. While David and Emily attempt to stifle Corey\'s bleeding wound, the hooded figure begins to fill the ATM booth with cold water, attempting to freeze them to death. Corey eventually dies of blood loss and hypothermia. David and Emily concoct a plan to trigger the fire alarm to send for help, using Corey\'s lighter, a trash can, and paper. Emily climbs on David\'s shoulders and manages to get the fire close enough to the fire alarm and is successful, but David slips and Emily falls, smashing her head, and dies. The man had driven David\'s car against the door before filling the ATM with water and now smashes the security guard\'s car into it. Angered, David attempts to throw a Molotav cocktail at the hooded killer, only to realize that it is not the killer, but the body of the killed security guard. The police arrive and David is arrested. While David is being driven away, he sees several figures in similar parkas as the killer, still unsure of who the masked madman could be. The police find a video tape recording the events within the ATM, but it is made obvious that the killer had planned his actions so as not to appear in the footage, effectively framing David for the killer\'s crime. He also planted other evidance against David. In the final scene of the film, the hooded figure, still unknown, returns to his headquarters, where he begins to map out similar attacks on a mini-mart.'] ["The film shows the lives of these four students gathered in one room at a university in the city of Cairo.

Self-conscious of his own 5ft 6 ins height, he is married to a tall blonde gallery owner named Diana . Diana hopes for a family, but Roger is evasive on the subject. Roger is also an art thief, stealing pictures from clients, using information he works out of them during job interviews. His friend and accomplice, Ove , who works at a surveillance company, helps Roger with his thefts by deactivating the victims' home security systems and helping sell the stolen artwork. Ove has set up a surveillance camera to film his Russian prositute friend without her knowledge, but visible to his friends at the surveillance company. The camera is aimed at the chair, but not the bed. During an exhibition at Diana's gallery, Roger meets Clas Greve , who wants to be the CEO of Pathfinder, a surveillance company, a job for which Roger is recruiting. He seems highly qualified, having apparently recently left a position as CEO of one of Pathfinder's main competitors. Roger becomes jealous of Clas, in part due to his attention to Diana. Roger discovers that Clas owns a rare Rubens painting and contacts Ove. A few days later, Roger and Clas meet at a restaurant and, while playing squash, Clas tells Roger more about his past. He joined the Danish army when he turned 18, and was selected for an elite unit that tracked criminals. He is clearly familiar with very sophisticated techniques for tracking people. He is now in Oslo to renovate his recently deceased grandmother's apartment. Roger breaks into Clas's apartment and steals the painting. He sees some children playing outside and realises he wants children with Diana. He calls her but hears her cellphone ringing in Clas's bedroom, finding her cell phone in Clas's bed. The next day, he prepares to go to work, but finds Ove, without a pulse, in his car in his garage. Roger hides Ove in the boot and finds a used poison syringe  under the upholstery of the seat of the car. Roger drives the car to a lake, where he dumps of Ove. As he sits by the lake grieving, Ove regains consciousness and Roger rescues him from the lake. Roger realises Ove knelt on the syringe as Ove tried to retrieve the painting from Roger's car's roof pocket, the poison syringe injecting Ove's knee and the poison slowly flowing through his body, thus not killing him. They go to Ove's cabin, where Ove tells Roger to call for a doctor. Roger, not wanting the police to get involved, gets Ove some milk from the refrigerator to slow down the poison. He picks up a gun Ove stores in the refrigerator and returns to find Ove holding a semi-automatic handgun, demanding Roger call a doctor. Ove, faint, loses control of the heavy handgun, shooting a spray of bullets at Roger, puncturing the milk carton. Roger accidentally shoots off one shot, hitting Ove in the head, killing him. Roger is aghast, but decides to put on Ove's clothes as a disguise. Roger leaves the cabin and sees Clas exiting an SUV parked outside, with a machete and his Dogo Argentino dog. Roger gets to his car in time, but Clas breaks the window and tries to attack Roger. Roger drives away and finds Ove's car on the side of the road. He gets into the car and drives to the lake, where he strips and puts Ove's clothes on. He then goes to a farm, where the farmer lets Roger stay in the cabin. Roger realises that Clas is trying to kill him and is tracking him somehow. He hides in an outhouse and sees Clas and his dog near the house. Clas realises that Roger is in the outhouse and enters, but Roger is nowhere to be seen. Roger hides under the outhouse in the manure, with only an empty roll of toilet paper through which to breathe. He escapes to the barn, but Ove's car has been disabled. He goes to the farmer's house, finding the farmer dead. He gets the keys to the tractor and runs to the barn, but is attacked by Clas's dog, which Roger impales on the tractor spikes. Roger drives the tractor away from the barn and sees an SUV, identical to Clas's, following him. In his attempt to evade his pursuer, he overturns the tractor and loses consciousness. We see that the driver behind him was not in fact Clas. Roger wakes up in hospital, being treated for his injuries. A nurse tells him that police officers want to talk to him about the death of the farmer. Roger realises that Clas killed the farmer, who didn't want to give away Roger's location. Roger runs away from two fat identical twin police officers. He is then arrested by two other police officers who think that Roger is actually Ove. In the car, a truck is reported stolen. They spot a semi driving toward them. One of the police officers exits the car and tries to stop the truck. The semi rams the police car and the police officer off the cliff. Roger regains consciousness wedged between the two dead fat police officers. He tries to escape, but sees Clas walking towards the car and pretends to be dead. Clas, thinking Roger is dead, walks away. Roger escapes from the car, and swaps clothes with one of the dead police officers, whose face is disfigured and unidentifiable. He hammers the police officer's fingers, so no-one can identify the fingerprints. Roger, thinking that he is being tracked by high-tech transmitters in a gel in his hair, shaves his hair off and puts it in a bag of peanuts, which he hides in the police officer's shirt. Roger makes an unannounced visit to his former mistress, Lotte , and asks for help. Lotte says she will help him, and goes to the bathroom to get some water and first aid to clean him up. However, Roger mistrusts Lotte, who he finds has just texted Clas that he is still alive and with her. Roger confronts Lotte with a gun, and she reveals that Clas was sent by his former company, HOTE, which is now in financial crisis, to steal some of Pathfinder's technology, and that she became his mistress as a way for her to introduce Clas to Roger. While Roger turns away, Lotte reaches for a kitchen knife and stabs him, which ends with a fight and Lotte being shot dead by Roger. Roger then suprises Diana on the porch of their house where she confesses and apologizes for her affair with Clas. After spending the night, Roger sneaks into the forensic morgue the next day. He takes the bag of peanuts from the body of the police officer. Diana texts Clas about meeting at his apartment, and she turns up at his apartment and the two embrace. Roger goes to Ove's cabin and cleans up all of the evidence that he was there. Clas walks into the room with a gun trained on Roger. At the suveillance company Ove's coworkers can see Clas and gun on their surveillance, but not Roger or Ove. Clas tells Roger that Diana doesn't love him anymore, and then tries to shoot Roger. However, all he fires are blanks, and Roger shoots and wounds Clas with Ove's automatic handgun. Roger says that Diana does love him: Roger told her he was going to Ove's cabin and Diana replaced the bullets in Clas' gun with blanks. Clas then tries to reach for another gun in the cabin, but Roger is too quick and shoots Clas dead. Roger leaves the handgun  in Ove's hand and climbs out the window so he will not be seen on the surveillance camera. After viewing the surveillance video, the police conclude that Class and Ove were working together as art thieves before killing each other in a shootout. Ove also gets blaimed for killing Lotte. A famous detective who had been investigating the art thefts is confused because Ove's autopsy determined that Ove had died well before Clas, but to take the credit for resolving the crime, the detective publically accepts the clear-cut solution. Later, Roger and a pregnant Diana are shown selling their house. Roger is then back at work introducing another CEO candidate to Pathfinder."] ['This film is based on the true story of Carl Upchurch . The film begins as Upchurch is racing to a church.

Torriti takes Jack under his wing, and the two keep in touch even after Jack\'s career takes him from Berlin.

But at the end of the movie Angleton is proven right about the mole. At his farewell of the CIA he also mentions some other top KGB-agents in the world, the West German Chancellor Willy Brandt, US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and the Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme.

The criminals are unremorsefully casual, and play Chinese Chequers on the bench whilst the judge reads out their sentence. En route to the escort van one of the convicts boisterously remarks "you just watch... we\'ll be walking free in 20 days". The scene morphs to complete darkness and the starting credits roll. The movie now opens with AgniPutra, a nuclear-capable ICBM being lynched en route to a secret location. The perpetrator of the heist is shown to be Sugirtharaja  a charismatic antagonist with a flair for sadistic mockery. Back in HQ, a visibly distraught panel of ministers and military top brass led by Mr.Rao  mull over the dangerous prospects of a nuke falling into terrorists\' hands. After some deliberation, they appoint A.K.Vikram  a government operative, to locate the AgniPutra. News of this appointment somehow reaches Sugirtharaja who promptly orders Vikram killed. But the henchman  accidentally shoots to death his three-month-pregnant wife before fleeing to safety. Filled with bitterness, Vikram rebukes Rao for the costly leak and deftly exposes the mole in his office - the trusted secretary Thangaraj. After some torturing Thangaraj names Sugirtharaja as the mastermind in front of the panel, but jumps to his death without giving any further details. At this Vikram wryly remarks "Rule Number One: Never conduct interrogations on the eighth floor". Rao introduces Vikram to a computer expert Preethi  who knows the design of AgniPutra\'s on-board computer. She is initially annoyed with Vikram\'s crude ways, but mellows down eventually. Later whilst at a cinema theatre, Vikram spots Sugirtharaja in a news reel footage. Further investigation reveals that all the bad eggs are in Salamia, a fictional country that doesn\'t entertain intel-sharing with India. With the diplomatic route ruled out, Vikram and Preethi embark on a mission to disarm the nuke by infiltrating Salamia. They tag along with a troupe of folk artists who intend entertaining the winsome Sultan of Salamia . Once in Salamia, the charming princess Inimaasi , sister of the Sultan, falls head-over-heels for Vikram despite the language barrier. Though Preethi is constantly put off by Vikram’s arrogance, she falls for him too. Vikram identifies the location where the nuke is held  and also discovers that the High Priest is a traitor who under Sugirtharaja\'s directions is secretly using the Eli Kovil to enrich AgniPutra\'s nuclear capabilities. One night he sneaks into the Eli Kovil, tweaks the AgniPutra\'s on-board computer  and inadvertently forays into a "males not allowed" zone where he meets Inimaasi. His attempts to expose the priest\'s treason are met with sheer dissent as she is only interested in a carnal relationship. The sultan catches the couple hand-in-honey and sentences Vikram to be decapitated in public. Vikram however, escapes execution and flees to the desert on camelback where a gun-toting Sugirtharaja  chases him until he gives in to dehydration. Vikram is bitten by a black cobra, and Sugirtharaja leaves him for dead. Back at the Royal Palace, the High priest stages a coup and holds the Sultan at gunpoint. Inimaasi manages to escape on camelback, and finds the delirious Vikram in the desert. She nurses him back to health with an amorous touch of love. The couple then return to the palace and fight off the armed sentries while the Sultan impales the high priest on his super-sized sword. Sugirtharaja, oblivious to the fact that AgniPutra\'s on-board computer has been tweaked, launches it hoping to decimate New Delhi. At HQ the Indian officials watch in despair as their computer screen shows a 2D animation of AgniPutra slowly descending upon New Delhi. Their despair turns into cheer when the missile soars back into the skies and plunges far away into the Bay of Bengal, thus not harming anyone. Back in Salamia the royal guards have almost taken back the palace, and the siege has almost been annulled. A disillusioned Sugirtharaja forces Preethi into a glider and takes off. Vikram follows the plane on horseback, throws a lasso at the skids and eventually climbs onto the wings. A high-action scuffle ensues with the hero clinging onto the plane despite all the pummeling, then forcing his way into the cockpit to batter the villain. Sugirtharaja sets-off a bomb and jumps with a parachute backpack  strapped-on. Vikram and Preethi jump off as the plane explodes, and a tense fight ensues in mid air amidst the freely falling trio. Sugirtharaja loses the backpack to Vikram and falls to his death, while the latter parachutes down to safety cuddling and kissing his girl. The buxome princess arrives on camel back and the film ends on a frivolous note, with the hero running away from two gorgeous dames close on his heels.'] ["The film revolves around the characters Shubhankar  and Vidhi  and Medha .

Each family represents a different slice of early 1980s middle-class society. Kannan and Uma are a working couple. Kannan's father, retired from Government service, lives with them. They enjoy the comforts of dual income, but their general lament is that their long work hours compel them to send their five year old daughter Priya to boarding school. The second couple comprises real estate agent Paramasivam and his homemaker wife Parvathi. Real estate in the early 1980s is not very profitable or progressive. Paramasivam and Parvathi enjoy a happy marriage, but Paramasivam's limited  income is barely able to meet household costs. The third couple is Srinivasa Raghavan and Lakshmiammal. Fifty-five year old Srinivasa Raghavan is a worthless wastrel. In spite of a college education, he has never worked a day in his life. He chooses to roam about the city and engage in pointless banter with anyone he can find. Lakshmiammal works as a cook to earn a meager wage, but they frequently have to pawn their valuables to get by. Their son Madhu is an aspiring actor with dreams of making it big, and their daughter Mythili is still in high school. Their everyday lives have ups and downs. Kannan and Uma work all through the week. Uma takes German lessons in the evenings. Their overburdened schedule permits them to see their daughter only on weekends, and as a result they gradually drift away from the needs of their child. As for Paramasivam, his income is squeezed by the down market or by crafty tenants . Lakshmiammal works long hours in hot kitchens, and worries that her declining health might just give out one day. There are some new arrivals. The first is Parvathi's brother Kumar. Kumar has recently graduated from college, and he arrives in Chennai to start a new job. He plans to stay with Parvathi for a few days until he finds a new place. The second arrival is Anandan, a mild-mannered young man. He used to work at a rice mill in Nagapatnam, but when the mill was destroyed in a cyclone, his employer transferred him to another job in Chennai. Anandan is happy to find another job, but despairs because he is away from his wife and children in Nagapatnam. He is not able to afford weekly trips to see his family. Lakshmiammal recognizes an opportunity and proposes a boarding arrangement. Anandan is happy to accept; Lakshmiammal's home cooked food is healthier and cheaper than eating out every day. The families are faced with various crises. Kannan's father discovers that Lakshmiammal has been visiting a hospital to treat an emerging tuberculosis ailment caused by long exposure to cooking flames. Kannan's father discreetly informs Mythili that Lakshmiammal must not continue working. Mythili drops out of school and starts working at a palatial mansion in the city.  The job, however, pays quite well and Mythili anonymously sends a portion of the money to her mother. Srinivasa Raghavan remains oblivious or apathetic to the whole situation. Kannan and Paramasivam are also faced with trouble. Uma receives a promotion at work. Kannan is unable to accept that his wife makes more money. Priya continues to drift away from her parents, and refuses to come home for Diwali. When Parvathi suddenly becomes pregnant, she is forced to abort because of their strained financial situation. Paramasivam is stricken cold by the fact that he did not have cash for the cab to bring his wife to the hospital. Uma, Parvathi and Lakshmiammal individually ponder the central questions of the film &mdash; the role of money and the role of working women in the new society order. Their troubles escalate. Kannan dreams that Uma is seduced by her German boss, and that she will eventually leave him. Paramasivam is compelled to borrow money, at exorbitant interest, from a loan shark. Parvathi is deeply grieved to learn this. Lakshmiammal follows Mythili and assumes the worst when she sees that a car is sent to fetch Mythili every day. She breaks down in tears before Srinivasa Raghavan. When Srinivasa Raghavan angrily question Mythili, she retorts that he, having never provided for the family, has no fatherly rights to ask about her business. The men set about evaluating their situation. Kannan and Uma decide that their child is a higher priority than additional income, and Uma accordingly resigns from her job. Kannan's father provides additional support by way of his retirement income. Paramasivam finally agrees to let Parvathi get a real job. And Srinivasa Raghavan, stung by his daughter's criticism, sets off to find work. Undaunted by rejection from various offices, he finally earns a day's wages by working on the docks. He returns home with dignity. Now that he has restored his station as a father, he claims the right to question Mythili. He bluntly asks if she has been prostituting herself. Mythili takes him to the palatial mansion. She reveals that the lady of the house has been stricken with a paralysing disease and that Mythili's job is to help her with her daily duties. Mythili breaks into sobs, saying she has not done anything to dishonor the family. Harmony is restored to just about everyone. Anandam, in tragicomic irony, is suddenly transferred away to Dindigul just as he has found a job for his wife in Chennai. His wife now takes his place in the apartment and writes to him every week. The film ends with the missive that money is required for life but life must not be entirely consumed by money."] ['Ram Khanna is a wealthy industrialist with a trusting soul.

One of these truckers leaves the lodge to urinate and overhears a fellow trucker screaming in pain inside one of trucks. Curiosity piqued, the drunk trucker checks the truck out but walks away after it goes quiet. Moments later, the door is kicked out. The scene transitions to Detective Dwight Faraday , a burned-out detective whose main priority is dealing with animal attacks. He and his partner, Officer Jacob Reed , are sent out on a call to investigate a strange call about a possible animal attack/murder. Upon arriving, the officers are shown the truck from the opening sequence, and determine that the door to the truck was kicked out by something extremely powerful. Detective Faraday enters the truck with the formerly drunk trucker from last night, and determines from a jaw bone that the unrecognizable mass of blood and pulp was human. Faraday then questions the locals as to what happened, and determines that the victim was seen with a beautiful, Native American woman before he died. Then, Detective Patterson  takes over the investigation and after a verbal battle with Faraday, sends Faraday back to the station to deal with a minor animal attack case.  Back at the station, Faraday is distracted by the mystery of the dead trucker, and comes to the realization that the victim was trampled from the groin upward. He goes to see the body and exchanges banter with Dana , the attending coroner, and determines that the man died in a state of arousal and has hoofprints on what is left of his body. Elsewhere, a businessman encounters a beautiful, silent Native-American woman  who takes the man to a hotel. The businessman is later labeled the second victim. Afterward, Dana and Faraday ponder how the murder occurred; thinking about having a deer in the cabin, or even that a woman used a deer leg as a weapon. Faraday goes home and tries to figure out the possible cause of the event, but dismisses all of his theories as implausible. Elsewhere, the same mysterious Native American woman walks into the shop of a blond Southern man and uses her charm to seduce him. In the morning, Reed confronts Faraday about finding yet another dead body, and they go down to the morgue to examine the new cadaver. The cadaver is that of the businessman, and the same markings found on the previous victim are noted: state of arousal, trampled, deer hooves. However, small deer hairs are found and the team makes the perpetrator out to be a deer. In addition, they determine that the same beautiful mysterious woman was seen before the crime occurred. Reed and Faraday head off the new crime scene. Upon arriving, they are confronted by other investigators. While Reed and Patterson are fighting about Faraday\'s right to be there, Faraday measures the distance between the bloody hoofprints left at the scene. The two are quickly kicked out of the scene and leave for home. Faraday decides to walk. As he passes a Native American mural, he stops at several places where the Deer Woman image is portrayed. Faraday tries to convince his skeptical boss about the presence of a so-called \'deer creature\' living within the city, mentioning a mutant wolf-like creature that was shot dead in Piccadilly Circus, London in 1981, . The police chief is skeptical, but gives Faraday the case. Faraday and Reed travel to a casino on a local Indian reservation, where they learn from the casino pit boss about a Native American legend about the Deer Woman: a malevolent forest spirit resembling a beautiful young woman with deer legs, who sexually arouses and kills men just for the ultimate thrill of it. The open-minded Faraday believes the story, but the skeptic Reed doesn\'t and wanders off. Faraday travels back to the police station to look up more history about the Deer Woman. Reed then unknowingly runs into the Deer Woman right at the casino, and offers to play the game of craps to impress her. Later that evening, Reed returns to his apartment with the Deer Woman when Faraday calls from the station and informs Reed that he\'s found old news reports that happened over a hundred years ago when eleven loggers in the woods were found trampled to death. Reed tells Faraday that he\'s got a woman with him and asks to call him tomorrow. Suspicious, Faraday asks Reed if he knows the woman and if he\'s seen her feet or legs. Reed suddenly realizes that the woman is the Deer Woman and yells to Faraday to send backup. The Deer Woman overhears and attacks Reed. Faraday races to Reed\'s apartment, but is too late: Reed already dead. The Deer Woman approaches Faraday, who instinctively shoots her in the shoulder. Examining the Deer Woman\'s body, Faraday pulls up her long skirt to reveal deer legs. Reviving, the wounded and angry Deer Woman kicks Faraday across the room and flees. Faraday runs to his car and gives chase which leads to a lonely road into the woods. Faraday catches up to the Deer Woman and rams his car into her, pinning her to a tree. Incredibly, the Deer Woman tries lifting Faraday\'s car off her, in which he shoots her several times, until she suddenly disappears without a trace. With the unexplained disappearance of the Deer Woman, Faraday ends up laughing hysterically at the irony of his being assigned to "animal attack".'] ["One night when young orphan Sophie cannot sleep during the 'witching hour', she looks out of the window of her dormitory and sees a cloaked giant blowing something into a bedroom window down the street. The giant sees her, and although she tries to hide in her bed, he reaches through the window and carries her away to his home. Fortunately for Sophie, she has been abducted by the world's only good giant, the Big Friendly Giant . Operating in the strictest secrecy, the BFG catches dreams  and at night, he blows his bottled dreams into the bedrooms of children. The other, larger giants are vicious, cannibalistic monsters; they go out into the world to steal and eat humans, mostly children, since there is little else for them to eat where they live. Because the BFG refuses to eat people, he must survive on a revolting vegetable known as a snozzcumber, and thus the other giants regard him with contempt. Sophie and the BFG form a quick bond, and the BFG develops a paternal sentiment for her. However, Sophie's life is put in danger by the sudden arrival of the Bloodbottler Giant, one of the fearsome, flesh-eating giants who live in the wastes outside the BFG's house. The giant demands to know who the BFG is talking to, but the BFG lies telling him he is talking to himself. The Bloodbottler  assumes the BFG is talking to a human and begins searching for Sophie so he can eat her. Sophie hides in the snozzcumber, unknown to the BFG, and the BFG offers the snozzcumber to the Bloodbottler, hoping that its foul taste will send the giant hollering out of the cave and leave him in peace. The Bloodbottler crunches up the snozzcumber, but luckily spits Sophie out. In a rage, the beast destroys the cave and storms out. The BFG helps Sophie recover, makes her a new dress and treats her to a strange, but delicious fizzy drink called frobscottle. It is rather unusual in that the bubbles in the drink travel downwards and therefore cause the drinker to break into loud flatulence instead of burping: this is known as a Whizzpopper, which cause the drinker of the frobscottle to fly. After this the BFG takes Sophie to Dream Country to catch more dreams he calls Phizzwizards, but is tormented by the other giants along the way, notably their leader, the Fleshlumpeater, the largest and most fearsome giant of all. After escaping them and arriving in Dream Country, the BFG demonstrates his dream-catching skills to Sophie, but is unlucky enough to catch a Trogglehumper, which is essentially a particularly horrific nightmare. Back at the BFG's cave, he shows Sophie the huge storeroom where he keeps all the dreams he has captured over the years. He even takes Sophie with him to watch him on his dream-blowing duties, but this is cut short when they spot the Fleshlumpeater about to feast upon one of the children that the BFG had blown a dream to. Sophie cries out, attracting the Fleshlumpeater's attention and forcing the BFG to flee. Sophie persuades the BFG that something must be done to defeat the evil giants, even if it means getting the word out. At first, the BFG is reluctant to do so, since he views all adult humans as bad people, but Sophie manages to convince him otherwise. Together, they develop a plan to get the Queen of the United Kingdom to help them. Using dreams from his collection, the BFG mixes up a terrible nightmare which will show the Queen what the giants do. They set off for Buckingham Palace and blow the dream into the Queen's bedroom. The BFG then leaves Sophie on the Queen's windowsill and retreats into the palace gardens. When the Queen awakens, Sophie convinces her that all of her dream was true. Because the dream included the knowledge that Sophie would be there when she woke up, the Queen believes her, and she speaks with the BFG. After considerable effort by the palace staff, the BFG is given a lavish breakfast and the Queen summons the Head of the Army and the Marshall of the Air Force to begin work on neutralizing the evil giants. Eventually a huge fleet of RAF Chinook helicopters follows the BFG to the giants' homeland. While the child-eating giants are asleep, the Army ties them up, planning to hang them under several helicopters each, and transport them to London, where a special large pit has been constructed from which they will not be able to escape. However the giants are disturbed and begin to wake up, causing chaos and several soldiers to be injured. Eventually the giants attempt to free themselves from the chains that bind them, resulting in them being knocked out, and peace is momentarily restored. The only one who escapes being trapped is the Fleshlumpeater, who immediately goes after the BFG, who decides to face the Fleshlumpeater despite knowing he will stand no chance against him. Infuriated at being betrayed, the Fleshlumpeater is about to kill the BFG when Sophie screams out. Hearing this, the Fleshlumpeater drops the BFG and prepares to eat Sophie alive, but after a long struggle he is finally subdued with the nightmare-inducing Trogglehumper BFG caught earlier, and is carried with the rest. The BFG mentions that the Trogglehumper was a dream about a legendary giant killer named Jack. As a punishment for their lifetimes of child-eating, the giants are placed in the pit and forced to eat Snozzcumbers for the rest of their lives, fed to them by the awful Mrs Clonkers who ran the orphanage Sophie lived in, resulting in its closure. Afterwards, the Queen offers Sophie a place to stay in her palace along with all the other girls in the orphanage. Contrary to the book's ending, the BFG doesn't live in England; he instead carries on his dream-blowing job. Sophie cannot bear to part from him, and so decides to remain with him thereafter. They together fly back to Giant Country."] ["Hamzah , a factory manager, is having an affair with his boss's wife and is also planning a strike in the factory.

He is drawn into the gang of slum crime lord ‘dada’ Shambu  where he falls into every crime but one: violence against women. When an impoverished but honourable young widow hangs herself after being raped by Shambu Dada, the cries of her orphaned baby awaken Bhagwaan’s soul. He rebels against his former master. Bhagwaan vows to atone for his formerly evil life, and adopts the orphaned baby as his own son. The innocent young boy becomes Bhagwaan’s source of personal redemption and the inspiration for all that he does. 12 years later the man now lovingly hailed as “Bhagwaan Dada” has transformed the former crime-ridden slum into a safe and happy neighbourhood - Shantinagar - where his adopted son Govinda  has become the pride and joy of the whole community. Despite his own dark past, this loving father has worked hard to raise the boy as a good person with sound moral values. At this time, Bhagwaan chances to rescue another naïve young man new to the big city – Swaroop  – when Shambu Dada’s gang steal all Swaroop’s money. Impressed with Swaroop’s education as well as the similarity of situation to his own arrival in the city years before, Bhagwaan takes the “innocent and simple” villager under his protective wing. He arranges a good job, even brings Swaroop home to live with himself and his son, young Govinda. Swaroop and Bhagwaan claim each other as ‘brothers’. One day on a roadway nearby the district, members of Shambu Dada’s gang assault a beautiful young woman whom Shambu lusts after. Swaroop hears her cries for help and tries to rescue her, believing as Bhagwaan does that: “It is every man’s duty to honour and protect women.” But Swaroop is a gentle bookish soul who does not know how to fight. He is badly beaten by Shambu’s men before Bhagwaan can rescue him in turn. The young woman  who gives her name as Bijli insists on tending the wounded Swaroop who bravely tried to help her. Bhagwaan invites Bijli to come live at their house until she can find a place to stay. After some initial confusion when Govinda mistakes Bijli for his new ‘uncle’ Swaroop’s wife, all four of them – Bhagwaan, Govinda, Swaroop, and now Bijli – live happily in Bhagwaan’s modest home, Govinda remaining impishly determined to matchmake between Swaroop and Bijli. However, what neither Bhagwaan nor Swaroop realise is that Bijli is a streetwalker. Intercepted on her way out to work one evening, Bijli spills Bhagwaan a yarn about how she is secretly an undercover policewoman assigned to pose as a prostitute in order to arrest real prostitutes and their patrons. Bhagwaan believes her. He preserves her ‘secret’, and all four continue happily in the house just as before, ignorance being bliss. The audience soon learn, though, that appearances are deceiving: Bijli is not, actually, a sex worker but rather working a fraud scam wherein she bilks potential ‘johns’ of money through clever ruses. Meanwhile, Shambu Dada has sworn revenge against Bhagwaan for foiling his plan to abduct Bijli. After brutally beating to death one of his gangmembers who botched the abduction, Shambu dumps the corpse in Bhagwaan’s territory seeking to frame Bhagwaan for the murder. The honest policeman Inspector Vijay , though, is fully aware of Shambu Dada’s crime empire activities as well as Bhagwaan’s reformation. When Bhagwaan discovers the corpse and duly reports the murder, Inspector Vijay not only fails to arrest Bhagwaan but even introduces Bhagwaan to a newspaper reporter – Madhu  – who is researching crime trends in the city, and recommends that she visit Shantinagar. The street-savvy Bhagwaan helps Inspector Vijay set a trap that allows the police to capture Shambu Dada in possession of the murder weapon. Shambu is convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment. All seems well. Bhagwaan invites Madhu to attend a joyous public celebration in Shantinagar. When young Govinda mischievously invites Bijli to garland his ‘uncle’ Swaroop, we discover that the blushing Swaroop hides a growing attraction to Bijli. When Madhu reciprocates Bhagwaan’s invitation by inviting him and Swaroop to her birthday party at a fancy hotel, Bijli manages to talk her way along. After Bijli’s comically jealous behaviour at the party, she confesses how she has come to love Swaroop, just as he loves her. She tries to explain that no future is possible between them. But Swaroop, ecstatic at learning his feelings are returned, simply won’t listen. Unknown to all, however, the evil Shambu Dada has escaped during transfer between prison facilities. Shambu vows to revenge himself upon Bhagwaan at all costs. While warning Bhagwaan of his danger at Shambu’s escape, Inspector Vijay happens to mention that Bijli is not, in fact, working for the police at all but has actually been arrested, if released, on suspicion of prostitution. Bhagwaan angrily confronts Bijli. Devastated, Bijli humbly confesses she lied about working with the police. Bhagwaan strikes her and throws her out of the house … and the whole neighbourhood. When Swaroop returns home he wants to support Bijli but it is already too late: Bijli is gone. All now seems lost for our lovers. But wait! A chance encounter with a doctor at a local hospital reveals Bijli’s true story: she has nobly sacrificed her reputation in order to raise money for the surgery and medicines needed to save the life of her sole surviving relative, a little sister, after the rest of their entire family were killed outright during the Bhopal Disaster. [1984 – cyanide gas cloud] Abjectly chastened, Bhagwaan and Swaroop comb the city for the missing Bijli, and almost abandon all hope. Swaroop finally discovers ‘Bijli’ – whole real name is now revealed as Geeta – at the hospital. The lovers are reconciled. Bhagwaan begs Geeta to claim him as her brother. He pledges himself to both pay for the little sister’s operation and see his ‘sister’ Geeta married happily to Swaroop at the earliest opportunity. Swaroop’s mother comes to welcome Geeta and bless Bhagwaan and Govinda – who is jubilant that his ‘matchmaking’ efforts succeeded – for their role in getting her son married. Geeta’s little sister’s operation is successful, so she also joins the household. The whole of Shantinagar eagerly helps with preparations for the upcoming wedding. Madhu, who is herself becoming romantically interested with Bhagwaan, comes to Shantinagar on the day before the big event “to help with wedding work.” Govinda persuades Madhu to help him distribute the last of the wedding cards throughout the community. Hours later Bhagwaan becomes alarmed to discover that neither Govinda nor Madhu has come back. Some distance beyond the end of the city Bhagwaan comes across an exhausted and terrified Madhu, who explains how both she and Govinda had been kidnapped by the gang of the fugitive Shambu Dada and taken to a ruined fort hidden in the wilderness. Shambu intended to rape her, but brave young Govinda had attacked Shambu so that she could escape, asking her to “Bring Father” for help. Deeper in the wilderness Bhagwaan finally finds little Govinda, who has been horribly mutilated and left to die. Govinda explains in a failing voice how he succeeded in overcoming Shambu’s gang with the fighting skills his father taught him, but was unable to defeat Shambu himself. Shambu then vented his rage, at being cheated of Madhu, by brutally crushing Govinda’s legs – “There were nails in his shoes, Father ...” – leaving the boy paralysed and bleeding to death. After receiving final blessing, Govinda dies in his father’s arms ... having sacrificed his own all-too-short life to save the life of another. As darkness falls in the wilderness, Bhagwaan tenderly burns his son’s remains. Bhagwaan solemnly vows to be avenged upon Shambu, and binds Madhu to silence regarding Govinda’s murder lest the wedding be interrupted. The wedding of Geeta and Swaroop goes forward, attended by the whole of Shantinagar. But part way through the ceremonies someone discovers that they’re missing the sindoor  needed to fill the bride’s hair parting for the ritual. Bhagwaan rushes off to buy the essential sindoor. Shambu confronts Bhagwaan in the marketplace. They fight bitterly, until Bhagwaan at last overwhelms Shambu. Remembering poor Govinda’s last words, Bhagwaan dons one of Shambu’s horrible nail-studded boots and uses it to finish off Shambu. Or so he thinks. At the very last, the dying Shambu manages to hurl a hidden knife that pierces Bhagwaan’s chest. Knowing himself to be mortally wounded, Bhagwaan returns to the wedding just at the point where the ceremony requires him, as the bride’s brother, to bless the newly wedded couple – which he does, using a smear of his own red blood instead of the hard-won sindoor. Geeta and Swaroop now realise he is injured and dying, also that Govinda, too, is missing. Bhagwaan responds that he is “on his way to join Govinda” ... and dies in their arms in his turn. Swaroop and Geeta pledge to continue Bhagwaan’s legacy at Shantinagar.'] ["The plot revolves around a renowned writer, his wife who is a fashion designer and their 7-year-old daughter.

Shraeger was chosen mostly because Brown believes her to be incorruptible, since she comes from a wealthy family and chose to work for the police from a sense of doing good, rather than for money. As soon as she meets her new partner, they start a quest for Walsh's ex-partner's killer. He was a corrupt cop, which was a known fact, but he was also investigating other cops at the 2nd Precinct. His main focus was Det. Henry Cole who once lived by another name and robbed an armored car. Cole's partner, Det. Allison Beaumont, is later revealed to be Walsh's girlfriend. Besides Shraeger, Walsh, Beaumont and Cole, the station has three more detectives: Leo Banks, who wears a bulletproof vest everywhere he goes, because he is afraid he will die at age 42, as his father, grandfather and uncle did; Banks' partner Eric Delahoy, who has a brain tumor but refuses to notify anyone or get treatment that can potentially kill him or leave him disabled; and Eddie Alvarez, who believes himself to be a 'lone wolf' and talks about himself in the third person.

Patrick then destroys the camera, saying it is not fast enough. SpongeBob doesn\'t attribute Patrick\'s failure to the camera, but rather the "very nature of the fragile bubble". He then sings a song about bubbles, during which he pledges to blow a bubble that will last all day, then accidentally blows a larger bubble than expected. It lifts SpongeBob and Patrick off the ground and they eventually float into a cave. Then, a broken coin  pops the bubble. Patrick assumes the amulet belonged to SpongeBob\'s ancient ancestors . They take it to the Bikini Bottom museum to see if the staff there know what it is. There, Mr. Krabs sets up his own admission booth, but soon takes it down when a person who he cheated of money complained to a Museum security guard. Patrick and SpongeBob run into Squidward, who was busy painting. Squidward thinks SpongeBob and Patrick stole the missing half of the Amulet. He soon matches it to the displayed other half of the Amulet. Then Mr. Krabs, interested in the untold riches, runs into Squidward, who tells Mr. Krabs that the streets of Atlantis were paved with gold and street lights made of diamonds . Squidward teaches Mr. Krabs, SpongeBob and Patrick about Atlantis, its origin and other things, including the Oldest Living Bubble, to SpongeBob\'s delight. Sandy, who overheard them, steps in, mentioning Atlantis\' science. Sandy, Patrick, Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob convince Squidward to link the two halves together since according to legend, if the two halves were joined, the path to Atlantis would open. The magical path  is opened. The captain tells the group to refill fuel, but he reveals the fuel as song . The group sings about their desires. Plankton sneaks on wanting to use Atlantis\'s powerful weapons to become king of the city.

There, they meet the Atlantean King, Lord Royal Highness , who shows them a grand tour of the fortress. During the tour, Mr. Krabs, Sandy and Squidward each get distracted by places in Atlantis; Mr. Krabs unsurprisingly by the treasury room, Sandy by the science lab, and Squidward by the art gallery. Each sings their own song about how much they love Atlantis. Meanwhile, Plankton checks out the Weaponry Room. He then chooses his weapon, a tank. Finally, SpongeBob and Patrick get to see the world\'s oldest living bubble alive, over 1 million years old. They take a picture of it, which causes the bubble to pop. They are afraid to speak, saying they have to go back to Bikini Bottom . Then, Patrick shouts out the \'truth\'. Lord Royal Highness is not mad at SpongeBob and Patrick for popping the bubble, saying that the one they popped was just a prop for the tourists. He then shows them the real oldest living bubble, but once again, when Patrick takes a picture of it, it pops. Angered, Lord Royal Highness summons the Atlantean Royal Guard to attack, but the gang manage to escape . Just when they escape outside with the guards still in pursuit, Plankton comes in and tries to destroy them with the tank he found, but it showers the group with strawberry ice cream, much to Plankton\'s dismay. Lord Royal Highness picks Plankton up saying that a "talking speck" would be a better replacement for the bubble. Lord Royal Highness removes the Amulet from the bus and orders a guard to dispose of it.

While Rae aspires to get to that level, she becomes somewhat complacent over time, not having any immediate financial worries because of her seemingly comfortable situation, as Wyn has provided her with a home and vehicle. Rae\'s world is shattered when Wyn dies suddenly of a heart attack in his sleep while on a trip to the Bahamas with her. Rae finds out that Wyn\'s wife has taken over his company and as everything she had was legally in his name, she has no deed to her home or title to her car.

In this film, Upendra metaphorically represents Karnataka, Prabhu Deva metaphorically represents Tamil Nadu, and Priyanka Upendra metaphorically represents the Kaveri River that flows between the two states. The love triangle of the three characters metaphorically represents the Kaveri River water dispute. Honnuru  and Chennooru  live on the banks of the river Cauvery. The river is the lifeline of both these villages where people live in harmony, love and brotherhood. A love-struck couple representing each of the villages actually manages to bear a child as a symbol of the unity they share. Kireek  who manages to convert the love that the couple shares into arrows of gossip thus successfully igniting a full blown communal riot. The once friendly and harmonious villagers now turn thirsty for each other’s blood killing the loving couple in the process. The woman bears the child in the middle of the river Cauvery. The cautious boatman takes the girl child, now christened Cauvery, to a medication center run by some saints nearby. Cauvery  grows up in the nature’s bosom and is also shown to be a caring and nurturing girl who only believes in selfless giving. Udayashankar  who is pretty much the landlord of the entire village. He has his own way of dealing with problems and internal conflicts. He believes in equality. And not just among people but even in their status in the society. This is probably why Kireek  is awestruck to find beggars on motorbikes and sweepers in double breasted suits in Honnuru. Under the baton of Uday’s leadership equality is a forced entity. One of the humorous situations shows how Uday managed to trade places of his rich parents with a poor worker’s family. This, in effect, is how Uday sees equality among all. Vairamuttu  who is shown to be a Chennoorian returning from the United States. Not only does he bring back stuff for himself but for his entire village! Soon we have farmers using laptops while irrigating their fields and their wives prancing around with Nike T-shirts and sunglasses. While Muttu also believes in equality, his vision is about the future. He nurses political aspirations and has figured out that if he keeps his people happy then he is sure to achieve a lot of mileage on his political vehicle. Uday and Muttu have only one thing that sparks friction between them – Cauvery, the doctor. When she is not busy curing patients, she is playing the mute doll between these two exceedingly eccentric characters. She has no feelings of love or romance with either of them yet is drawn towards each of them. Unfortunately not once does the poor girl get a chance to speak her mind to either of them. While Uday is busy creating “heaven on earth” and praying to her photograph at home, Muttu is Michael Jackson-ing himself in front of her till the cows come home. Kireek Sparks fly once again between the two cities to bring an end to this bizarre tale of love. Uday and Muttu confront each other claiming stake for Cauvery’s hand. Each one thinks she belongs to him and the other would face death if thought otherwise. One thing leads to another and the heat of hatred starts spreading beyond the river and its banks. The people of each of these villages get involved and before you know it, Kireek has successfully managed to spin tales and communal riots resurface. People who once admired each other are now chopping each other off, burning each other’s houses, violating each other’s women. Kireek manipulates with their innocence and manages to bring complete destruction to their doorsteps. There are no winners and losers here. Cauvery is the only one who has lost more than just the prospect of love. She has lost trust and more importantly goodwill for everyone around her. No amount of nurturing can ever bring it back. In effect, everyone has already lost Cauvery.http://shakreviews.blogspot.in/2006/03/h2o-2002.html'] ['Samir is a handsome, young man in his mid twenties.

Despite this, he is also commonly assisted by his unpopular, geeky only friend Greg in accomplishing goals that he frequently sets for himself such as being elected class president or earning the money to purchase his desires, although episodes normally end with more misfortune and unhappiness for Chris as his plans often may backfire on him somehow or end with him about to receive harsh discipline or a scolding from Rochelle."] ["In the Sunan Kuning prostitution district in Semarang, Central Java, several prostitutes and criminals are living in close proximity.

Instead of taking over the planet by force, the Oni give humans a chance to fight for the rights to the planet by competing in a competition. The competition is a variant of the game of tag , in which the human player must touch the horns on the head of the Oni player within one week. The computer selected human player is Ataru Moroboshi, a highly lecherous, very unlucky and stupid high school student from the Japanese city of Tomobiki, and the Oni player is Princess Lum, daughter of the leader of the attempted Invasion. Despite his initial reluctance to take part in the competition, Ataru becomes extremely interested in the game when he meets Lum. When the competition begins, Lum surprises everyone by flying away and Ataru finds himself unable to catch her. Before the last day of the competition, Ataru's girlfriend Shinobu Miyake encourages Ataru by pledging to marry him if he wins. On the final day of the competition, Ataru wins the game by stealing Lum's bikini top, which prevents her from protecting her horns in favor of protecting her modesty. In celebrating his victory, Ataru expresses his joy at being able to get married; however, Lum misinterprets this as a proposal from Ataru and accepts on live television. Despite the misunderstanding, Lum falls in love with Ataru and moves into his house. Despite Ataru's lack of interest in Lum  and attempts to rekindle his relationship with Shinobu, Lum frequently interferes and eventually Shinobu loses interest in Ataru. Still, Ataru's high flirtatious nature persists despite Lum's constant attention. Lum attempts to stop him from flirting, which results in Ataru receiving powerful electric shock attacks from Lum as punishment. Two characteristics of Ataru are particularly strong: his bad luck that draws to him all possible weirdos of the planet, the spirit world and even galaxy, and his prodigious ability to support extreme physical wounds without a scratch, beyond doing incredible physical performances like ninja tricks and catching a katana with his bare hands. Later Lum begins attending the same school as Ataru despite his objections , and Lum develops a fanbase of admirers among the boys of the school, including Shutaro Mendou, the rich and handsome heir to a large corporation all the girls from Tomobiki are crushing on . Despite their romantic interest, none of Lum's admirers would risk upsetting Lum by trying to force her and Ataru apart, although this doesn't stop them from trying to get Ataru punished from his own behavior, and interfering every time they get closer. As the series continues Ataru develops his own feelings for Lum but, for reasons never explained, he denies them even to himself and acts brashly towards her. Only when he is almost certain to lose her, he shows how much he values her, sometimes even putting his life in peril, almost to a suicidal level. After the danger passes, his idiocy and blasé attitude resume. Most visibly in the Destiny Production Arc, he had the opportunity to construct his ideal future, where he is the master of a harem. However, while visiting this future he discovered that Lum dumped him because of the ill-treatment that his future-self  the present Ataru didn't think twice before throwing this future aside. Similarly, seeing how happy Lum was in a future where they were getting married, he did all he could to save it. The stories are mostly unconnected and very few of them actually told events with later effects in the plot, the majority of the stories concluding without explaing how the things settled, as in the next story all is back to normal. The manga plot differes from the anime/movies plot in some details. First many characters, that appeared only a couple of times in the manga, became regulars in the anime. The best examples of this are the Lum Strormtroopers: Megane, Chibi, Perm and Kakugari. While in the manga they appeared only in the first two volumes, later replaced by Shuutaro Mendou, in the anime they are among the main characters , filling they roles alongside Mendou. Another example is Ten, the arsonist cousin of Lum, that in the manga appeared from the seventh volume, but in the anime he appeared since the third episode, so many tales are modified to include him. Many of the anime episodes are based on two or more tales put together, others are entirely new tales, and others are expanded single chapters. Also the tales composed of more chapters are compressed in single episodes. Finally, the order in which stories are told is different from the one of the manga. Also, Ataru and Lum are closer in the anime, sharing many more romantic moments and even properly kissing each other a couple of times . However, their relationship in the anime is also more complicated, because the order of episodes is different than the original manga order, so the evolution of the characters isn't linear. So in some episodes Ataru is extremely  attached at Lum, but in the next he tries to get rid of her forever. The same concept is appled to the other characters. For this reason the love square between Shinobu, Lum, Ataru and Mendou never came to an end, while in the manga Shinobu has a storyline devoted to her moving on from her crush, Mendou, in favor of Inaba, a trans-dimensional man dressed as a bunny, that in the anime appeared only in the first OVA and in the fifth movie."] ['Clark Davis  struggles to maintain his land and support his family during a long drought.

One of the civilians Anand , who lost his father in the shootout, swears that he will have revenge for the outrage when his close friend Bharath , son of a General  returns from abroad. Meanwhile Chitralekha ([[Kanchana , the princess of Vasanthapuri is living in Zurich, and is completely unaware that her zameen is in danger. She sees Bharath\'s photo in a local daily, and finds out that he is also from Vasanthapuri. She reads that he came first in the University of Bern, and develops interest in meeting him. That night, Chitralekha meets him at a club and congratulates him for his performance, while introducing herself as "Vasanthi" to hide her true identity. Quickly, they both fall for each other. They both enjoy as they start touring all over Europe, but suddenly Chitralekha\'s life takes a drastic turn: She hears about the danger in her zameen, and hence she has to return. Bharath also agrees to come, as he is also determined to save Vasanthapuri. During the flight, one of the flight attendants  announces that Diwan wants to marry the princess and will hence receive her at the airport. Chitralekha is not happy and commands that the flight take a different turn, but the attendant stops her from trying to escape. Bharath however supports Chitralekha and fights the attendant, causing the flight to continuously spin and in the process, the flight drowns in the sea. Bharath and Chitralekha are presumed dead, and this results in the dismay of their parents. The two are however washed ashore onto an island and are unconscious. They are cured by two local doctors who befriend them, and arrange a special raft for their return. Bharath realizes that Vasanthi is actually princess Chitralekha, but she advices him just to see her as his lover and not as the princess. They both arrive at Anand\'s house, and he is surprised to see Bharath alive. However, Chitralekha takes the guise of a normal girl because she does not want anyone to know that the princess is still alive, and to aide Bharath. Her true identity remains a secret to everyone except Bharath. The next day, people again protest at Diwan who starts killing them all, but Anand dies in the shoot out, saying that his death will be honored as a sacrifice and that the zameen would be avenged by Bharath. Meanwhile, Anand\'s mother also dies in the shock of her son\'s death, making Bharath and his friends more determined to save their zameen. They kill a few of Diwan\'s men, and seek shelter in a bar owned by Nagesh, who also becomes their ally. One by one, Bharath, Chitralekha and the rest of their gang secretly deal with Diwan and his army. Later at Diwan\'s castle, "Vasanthi" finally reveals herself as princess Chitralekha, and shocks everyone. Diwan immediately kidnaps her and boards a hot air balloon. But Bharath manages to reach him and after an intense fight, Diwan is killed. Peace returns to Vasanthapuri, so Bharath and Chitralekha are married.'] ["Sabira is the daughter of a wealthy, Akbar, who is cheated by his his manager, Hamid, and forced into a mental home.

Feigning compliance, Jake attacks Vance and knocks him senseless long enough for him to get to an escape pod and launch into space. However, the cause of the damage on board the Vanguard Explorer is unknown.  It is now six years later, in the year 2088. Command cadet Jonathan Hays, twenty-one, and his best friend Jessie \'Beanie\' Bienstock, a 14-year-old computer specialist, are among the young military cadets chosen to serve as the crew of Earth*Star Voyager, the planet\'s newest interstellar vessel. Due to worsening ecological conditions on Earth, there is a plan in place to evacuate the planet and colonize another world. . Probes have been sent out six years ago via the Vanguard Explorer, and one has sent data back on Berenson\'s Star; she has a life-zone planet which has been named \'Demeter\'. The mission of Earth*Star Voyager is to go to Demeter, perform a full planetary survey and return that information because if conditions on Demeter prove accurate , then the human race will colonize the world. The plan to colonize Demeter has already begun; ships are already being built to transport the population but will take forty years to complete construction of all the necessary vessels, and the trip to Demeter, with \'plasma-thrust\' engines and the Bauman Drive  will take 26 years. That was the rationale of choosing the crew from the Academy&mdash;for their youth and intelligence. Jonathan, as second-in-command, will assume command if Forbes is shown to be unable to continue his duties due to age. It is also mentioned that a modified form of cryogenic suspension will be used by the crew during the voyage in order to slow the aging process.  Among the crew members are Lani Miyori  and Luz Sansone, a fellow communications tech who takes an immediate liking to Beanie. Also aboard are Dr. Sally Arthur, a 24-year-old M.D., Huxley Welles, an 18-year-old navigator, and Dr. Leland Eugene, the ship\'s psychiatrist. The crew arrives aboard the Earth*Star Voyager, and are met by Captain Forbes , Brody , and \'Priscilla\', the sentient supercomputer that is the primary logic circuit for the vessel - who has seemingly developed a crush upon Huxley. It is mentioned that this was a concern by the programmers; Priscilla is designed from the brain engrams of Priscilla Bauman , and as such, she has all of memories, thoughts, feelings and desires of the real Priscilla Bauman. This is slightly annoying to Huxley. Adm. Beasley, a war hero who fought back a criminal organization called the Outlaw Technology Zone, gave them a final pep-talk and saw them off from his flag ship, the Triton Corsair. Not long after embarking on the mission, the ship has to pass through the junk belt. Immediately entering the belt, the auto-pilot is unable to travel the course plotted because the junk starts to move due to the ship\'s engines. After the shields and ship take some damage, Jonathan takes manual control and flys the ship through without taking further damage. While checking the repairs on an airlock, Captain Forbes finds himself trapped inside with the system set to open the airlock to space. Moments later, coming to check on the Captain, Jonathan finds him before the airlock opens. Before being blown into space, the Captain tells Jonathan to keep going and to \'complete the mission\'. Jonathan orders the ship\'s psychiatrist to review the crew\'s profiles for any hint of psychopathology. Later, Lani mentions to Jonathan that she has suspicions of Dr. Leland Eugene but Jonathan says he cannot go on a hunch alone. Following this Lani is critically injured while in cryo-sleep by an apparent malfunction. Along the way to Demeter, they pick up the long lost astronaut Capt. Jacob \'Jake\' Brown, while stopping at an abandoned station to make some repairs. Brown initially paralyzes Huxley with a weapon but it is revealed that he did so to prevent Huxley from walking straight into an "anti-matter zone." Capt. Brown is accepted onboard as an advisor to Jonathan and, finding out that the crew is only armed with hand weapons, volunteers to build a rail-gun with the help of Beinstock in an airlock. Jonathan then receives evidence of the death of Capt. Forbes and Lani\'s coma that points Leland, the psychiatrist. When Jonathan confronts him, Priscilla calls Jonathan that suspicious activity in the rail-guns airlock. Jonathan investigates and finds Brody, the fitness instructor, is sabotaging the rail-gun, a fight ensues and the fitness instructor is jettisoned out of the airlock. A transmitter is later discovered amongst his possessions, that he was apparently using to keep in contact with a blip that intermittently appeared on the Voyager\'s long range scans. The crew also explores a distress signal from a massive space station known as \'the 2020 World\'s Fair\', which is inhabited by warriors and researchers of the Outlaw Technology Zone. The landing party is captured by the warriors after encountering one of Captain Brown\'s former crew members, Willy. They discover that the mutinous Vance has also landed here and became "Top Dog" of the warriors by employing a stunner much like the one Brown used on Huxley. A warrior, named Whistlestick, who was beaten and humiliated by Vance explains that anyone may challenge the "Top Dog" at any time and Huxley demonstrates his skill at pickpocketing by getting the key for their cage. Brown offers to occupy their captors by challenging Vance while the rest escape. After a difficult fight, Brown  is able to make Vance\'s weapon backfire and destroys it - but spares Vance\'s life . In the ensuing ruckus the crew and their two new allies escape. The next discovery, explaining how Vance and Willie got to the World\'s Fair Station in the first place was finding the wreckage of the Vanguard Explorer. Capt. Brown requests the permission to board it and retrieve his logs to prove that the loss of his ship was due to mutiny, and to see if there was anything left salvageable. He, Beinstock and the Doctor find the ship to still have some power and computer function, but also find an unwelcome guest known as a \'Shell\'&mdash;a cyborg. Brown is able to shock the Shell into unconsciousness, and Doctor Arthur insists they take him to the ship to help and examine him. In a cut-away scene it is revealed that Adm. Beasley has become aware of the Shell\'s presence on Voyager, but is unable to do anything about it. Willie explains that the Shell is a cyborg created by the O.T.Z. and although it is only a drone it is probably packed with explosives. The Doctor with the help of Beinstock is able to disarm the explosives and treat his injuries, and is able to bring the Shell back to consciousness while also keeping him immobilized. They interrogate the Shell, and he mentions that his function is to help facilitate "Assembly." Data from the Vanguard indicates that several odd-looking ships passed by the Vanguard from the World\'s Fair over the last few years. Later analysis indicates the ships are modular. Later on, Dr. Arthur speaks to the Shell and discovers that he was abducted and turned into a cyborg when he was young. After making some small adjustments to him to ease his discomfort, Doctor Arthur and he form a brief emotional connection before his programming returns him to his drone-state. Later he regains his full movement and smashes his way through the ship, damaging Capt. Brown\'s jury-rigged railgun weapon and one of Priscilla\'s processors. The Shell warns them that they must stop "Assembly" then deactivates himself rather than let his programming make him kill Dr. Arthur. In another cut away scene, Vance finds himself in dire straights back on the World\'s Fair as the warriors now hunt him for his treatment of them. Admiral Beasley appears and demands an explanation from him. Their dialogue indicates that the mutiny on the Vanguard Explorer was part of some design of Beasley\'s and that Beasley is somehow connected, if not in control of, the O.T.Z. After Vance reveals he was defeated by the presumed-dead Capt, Brown Beasley leaves Vance to his fate, and returns to the Corsair. This scene is left out of some versions of the show. Back on board Voyager the crew have made repairs and discover how their spacecraft fits into a conspiracy concocted by the Outlaw Technology Zone and Admiral Beasley, the mastermind behind the entire plot . The O.T.Z. ships, the Assembly, were stationed in a binary solar system to use the light from the stars upcoming alignment to give them sufficient power to join together and form an even more massive and heavily armed ship. A section of the completed Assembly was designed to allow Voyager to fit in near the bow. Beasley\'s ship fires warning shots at Voyager to keep them on course to the Assembly, and then he reveals why he had chosen the best and the brightest the world had to offer to crew Voyager. He intended Voyager not to be an exploratory vessel but a colony ship. Joining the Voyager to the O.T.Z. Assembly would give Beasley the Bowman Drive and Priscilla. This would enable him to choose whom else would get to be part of his new Utopia, while leaving the rest of humanity to rot back on Earth. However, the crew outwits Admiral Beasley and escapes (after a battle in which they use jury-rigged weapons, including a \'solar laser\' . During the battle, Jake nearly sacrifices himself to hold together part of the electrical circuit that allows the railgun to be fired; he is saved by Sally. Aboard the Admiral\'s damaged vessel, the Triton Corsair, Admiral Beasley acknowledges Jonathan\'s skill as a commander, and promises that he will meet up with the crew of the Earth*Star Voyager again someday. There is an alternate scene of this in the 120-minute VHS version where Beasley is revealed to be some sort of robot or cyborg , while leaving out the promise dialog. Aboard the Earth*Star Voyager, Lani is found to be recovering from her injuries; Beanie and Luz  become a couple; it is strongly insinuated that Jake and Sally will become a couple; and Huxley is stunned to see that Priscilla  is a very beautiful woman. Beanie also reveals to Jonathan that he has decrypted the probe data and the crew sees that Demeter is a planet with striking similarities to Earth. The last line of the miniseries goes to Jake, who says, "You know, Captain, I think we oughta go check that place out..."'] ['Vishnu Vijayam was made in black and white and was directed by N.

The stranger then quickly took Hyun Woo\'s watch and wallet and fled the crime scene only to get into a car accident that instantly killed him. Because he was carrying Hyun Woo\'s watch and wallet, Hyun Woo\'s family quickly accepts the fact that he was indeed dead. Meanwhile, Eun Soo and her father who was on their trip back from the hospital in a nearby town nearly crashes their car in front of a badly injured Hyun Woo. The two of them quickly takes Hyun Woo to the nearest hospital saving his life only to find that Hyun Woo has lost his memories. With no ID or family contact, Hyun Woo had no choice but to live with Eun Soo and her father who hesitantly accepted Hyun Woo into the family. For two years they adopted the name \'Baek Chang Ho\' for Hyun Woo. During that time Eun Soo and \'Chang Ho\' falls in love and to prove that \'Chang Ho\' really did love Eun Soo he made a bird house aka mail box nailing it to a tree on top of a hill overlooking the villa with a love letter inside. Eun Soo\'s dad who realizes the love relationship quickly decides to step in and stop it before it could advance any further and confronts \'Chang Ho\' saying that one day \'Chang Ho\' will eventually regain his memories and in the end it\'ll be his daughter, Eun Soo, who will be hurt. After \'Chang Ho\' realizes this, he lies to Eun Soo that he doesn\'t want to live with them anymore and that he wants to go to the city to make more money so he can live on his own. This angers Eun Soo who was madly in love with \'Chang Ho\'. As \'Chang Ho\' was leaving on a bus, debt collectors come to the villa to get the money that Eun Soo and her father had not paid. In an attempt to help her father from being harassed by the debt collectors, Eun Soo throws herself into the fight and ends up getting injured but luckily \'Chang Ho\' returned just in time to save the time of them. Eun Soo\'s father falls unconscious so they quickly take him to the hospital and finds that her father\'s illness is getting worse. \'Chang Ho\' then tells Eun Soo that he\'ll never leave her side again. Eun Soo asks why \'Chang Ho\' returned when he willingly left, he explains that he had forgotten the letters that Eun Soo gave her. Eun Soo realizes that \'Chang Ho\' really does love her and finds the truth from her father that it was him who told \'Chang Ho\' to leave. After this incident \'Chang Ho\' decided that he\'ll stay with them in their villa forever and protect them. One night as Eun Soo and \'Chang Ho\' sat under the tree where their love mailbox is, \\\'Chang Ho\' gave Eun Soo a couple necklace saying that there is a curse on it. Whoever is the first one to take it off will obey the other one forever no matter how far away that person is and the only way to get rid of it was to read the piece of paper inside the locket to each other. \'Chang Ho\' takes it out and reads, "Even if I can\'t get my memories back, no, even if I remember and return to the unfamiliar reality, I will love you forever. This I promise you." They both kiss and soon after gets engaged before the death of Eun Soo\'s father. Meanwhile back in Seoul, Tae Min was asked to go to \'Dreaming Forest\', the villa that Eun Soo resides in. Mr. Kang wanted the owner of Dreaming Forest to sell their property to Kang Company since it\'s the last property in the area to clear off so they can build their project on top of it. Tae Min arrives to Dreaming Forest villa and finds that Hyun Woo aka \'Chang Ho\' had been livng there for the past two years with no recognition of who Tae Min is. Once Tae Min realizes this, it is then revealed that it was Tae Min who had sent the villain in the first place to get rid of Hyun Woo so Tae Min can inherit the company seeing that Tae Min is almost like a second son to Mr. Kang. After returning to Seoul Tae Min hired goons to kidnap Hyun Woo and kill him but fails. In the process of escaping the goons, he regains his past memories of who he really was and quickly returns to Seoul shocking everybody in the house including Tae Min. Hyun Woo was taken to the hospital where Soo Jin watched over him. She notices that Hyun Woo was wearing a necklace and took it off. When she opens the locket and reads it, she realized that Hyun Woo must\'ve loved a woman before coming back home and hides the necklace hoping that Hyun Woo would remember that woman again and what she hoped for came true because Hyun Woo had no memories of that past two years when he went missing. Later that night when \'Chang Ho\' didn\'t return, it then struck Eun Soo that \'Chang Ho\' had probably regained his memories and returned to his old life. Sad and depressed Eun Soo\'s friend Jang Mi comes to comfort her at the villa and finds that Eun Soo was throwing away every memory she had of \'Chang Ho\' by burning every picture she has of him. Jang Mi who has never seen \'Chang Ho\' says that Eun Soo will soon forget about him if she moves to the city with her not knowing that \'Chang Ho\' is Hyun Woo, now the director at the company Jang Mi works at. Eun Soo moves to the city and tries to get over \'Chang Ho\' and Jang Mi also helps by trying to hook her up with one of her co-worker. Eun Soo then mistook Tae Min as the co-worker that Jang Mi had hook her up with and tries to reason with him only to find that he wasn\'t the guy and befriends Tae Min in the process and helps her get a job at Hyun Woo\'s company later. One day as Eun Soo was on her way to visit Jang Mi at work, she finds Hyun Woo who looked like \'Chang Ho\'. She gives chase and throws herself in front of Hyun Woo\'s car and tells him that he is \'Chang Ho\', her lover, the one she had been searching for months. Hyun Woo tells her that he is not \'Chang Ho\' which angers Eun Soo as she doesn\'t understand why \'Chang Ho\' would suddenly seemed like a stranger. She slaps him causing him to misunderstand her. Thinking that she is a madwoman, he drives off as a security guard comes and hold Eun Soo back. Eun Soo then tells Jang Mi that \'Chang Ho\' is Hyun Woo, Jang Mi realizes that it might be impossible for Eun Soo to get him back because he was soon to be engaged with Soo Jin his former lover. Depressed and sad Eun Soo by chance meets with Tae Min a couple of times causing Tae Min to fall in love with the beautiful and sweet Eun Soo. As Eun Soo continues working in the company most of the female staff grew to hate her as she gets attention from the male co-worker, Park Ho Jin, the one Jang Mi tried to hook her up with earlier and not to mention Tae Min who is the GM of the company. Eun Soo was always given the heavy lifting job so she stayed late one night and manages to encounter an injured Hyun Woo who was also staying late counting inventory. Hyun Woo misunderstands her again thinking that Eun Soo probably wants something from him but she tells him that she just wants to work in the company forever. One day Eun Soo and her co-workers gather together deciding they were all heading towards the mountain for a one day break. A company car had broken down so one person has to stay behind and all girls especially the manager of the group wants it to be Eun Soo who stays back. Hyun Woo who was invited earlier to the trip meets up with the group and asked if they could use his car. Park Ho Jin aka Mr. Park states that Eun Soo was squeezed out so she could pair up with Hyun Woo. Jang Mi then takes the chance to push Eun Soo into the car and pushes the rest of the girls into the other two car to everybody\'s disliking. During the car ride to the mountain, Eun Soo and Hyun Woo don\'t talk much because of too much misunderstandings although Eun Soo tries to break the ice by offering kim-bap  to Hyun Woo who rejects it immediately. When they make it to the mountain, they immediately start off with a hike up the mountain. The manager of the group who is not a nature girl climbs the mountains with heels and sprang her ankle. Eun Soo who had lived in the country side all her life quickly solves the little ordeal and they all quickly leave the mountain letting Hyun Woo see a different side to Eun Soo which also causes him think different and even start liking her. Late that night as everybody was inside drinking and eating, Hyun Woo goes outside to make a phone call, Jang Mi seizes this chance to bring Eun Soo and Hyun Woo together. She tricks Eun Soo to go outside and then quickly runs back inside saying she needed to use the bathroom. As Eun Soo waited for Jang Mi she notices a poor man standing by the street trying to sell sweet roasted potato. She watches as the man makes a call home lying to his wife that business was going great but in fact truth was he was not selling at all. Feeling sorry for the man, she tries to go buy all of it only to find that she didn\'t have enough money. Hyun Woo who witnessed everything buys it for her then asks why she bought it all. She replies back saying that she wanted the man to return to his family as quickly as possible because you never know when your loved one will disappear. Hyun Woo then realizes that maybe Eun Soo wasn\'t as bad as he thought she was. They meet again by a lake at night where they engage in another conversation where Eun Soo lies to Hyun Woo that \'Chang Ho\' has died causing her to go up in tears where she walks away before Hyun Woo could see. She gets drunk and coincidentally runs into Hyun Woo who takes her back to Hyun Woo\'s room. As he watches her sleep, he notices the necklace that she wore. He opens it and reads the paper inside although not recognizing it, he felt that something was odd about the necklace. The next day as they returned to the city, Hyun Woo\'s opinion on Eun Soo dramatically changes. Days goes by and Soo Jin, the to be fiancee finds that Hyun Woo has changed and noticed how he\'s taken a liking to Eun Soo and slowly realizes that Hyun Woo may have feelings towards Eun Soo and this proved to be true one day at a party of Hyun Woo\'s Nuna. Two friends of Soo Jin finds out that Eun Soo is the girl who is causing Hyun Woo to stray and pushes her into a table holding an ice sculpture that nearly hits her before Hyun Woo rescues her. Hyun Woo then quickly drags Eun Soo out of the party. As Soo Jin watches them go out she feels hopelessly lost and then notices something glimmer on the ground and finds the same necklace that she had found on Hyun Woo at the hospital. Because she still has Hyun Woo\'s necklace she realizes that the necklace belonged to Eun Soo. Hyun Woo and Eun Soo makes it outside and he tells her that her plan of looking so pathetic is to make him sympathetic and fall in love with her has worked. Eun Soo who was hurt by his words tells him that she doesn\'t need his sympathy and will disappear from him forever. With this Hyun Woo becomes confused and realize his true feelings for her and goes to find her and tell her that he doesn\'t want her to leave and he loves her. The relationship starts but no one agrees to the idea as everybody wanted Hyun Woo to marry Soo Jin. Soo Jin on the other hand falls into a deep depression to the point where she tried to suicide but was luckily saved at the last moment and taken to the hospital. This anger\'s Soo Jin\'s parents and causes a rift between the Joon and the Kang. Eun Soo knows that it\'s her fault and after being summoned to Mr. Kang\'s office, she tells him that she\'ll leave Hyun Woo but Mr. Kang has to lie to Hyun Woo that she is a bad woman who manipulated them for money. Eun Soo then meets Hyun Woo for the last time on a date and quietly leaves. Soon after Mr. Kang gets sick and is taken to the hospital after Tae Min reveals to Mr. Kang that he is the son of the man that Mr. Kang had betrayed. After this, a problem arises in the company causing Hyun Woo to lose his position as director. Tae Min then takes the position and pushes Hyun Woo aside. Hyun Woo knows that in order for him to get the company back into his hands is to seek out a shareholder of company\'s stock with Soo Jin\'s help in order to gain the company back. The shareholder then tells Hyun Woo that Hyun Woo has to prove himself to him before he can help Hyun Woo thus leaving Hyun Woo hopeless. As they leave, Hyun Woo notices that Eun Soo was on a date with Tae Min. He goes to question Eun Soo as to why she would do this. She lies to him and tells him that she was only after his money. He tells her that he loved her and would have given her as much money as he would but she shakes him off saying that it\'s over leaving him heartbroken. As the engagement date of Hyun Woo and Soo Jin gets closer, Hyun Woo begins having dreams of the past. He would see the night where he and Eun Soo made a pact under the tree but has no idea that the girl in his dream is actually Eun Soo. He questions his family whether he had on a necklace or a ring on him when he returned but his mother replied with no. When the engagement party day came, Eun Soo returned to her villa and Hyun Woo reluctantly goes to the party with the vision of him and the girl getting clearer. Soo Jin and her mother also make their way to the party but Soo Jin forgets her box of jewelry she was to wear at the party, her mother insisted that she goes to get it. Instead of grabbing the box of the engagement jewelry, she grabs the box with Hyun Woo\'s necklace inside. Hyun Woo goes to see Soo Jin in her room where she is preparing for the party and she tells him to wait for her there while she goes off to attend something. Hyun Woo sits there obediently and hears a knock at the door. A worker who brought the box of jewelry sent by Soo Jin\'s mother. Hyun Woo takes the box and puts it on the side of the counter and instantly gets a phone call from his mother telling him to come out to greet visitors. He complys and gets up to leave but knocks over the box of jewelry. As he quickly picks up the jewelry, he notices a particular necklace and as he holds it up, memories of Eun Soo and him fills his mind. Quickly opening up the locket, he finds the piece of paper that was so familiar to him and realizes that Eun Soo was the girl of his dreams and that he was \'Baek Chang Ho\'. Soo Jin he enters the room right on time was confronted by a furious Hyun Woo. Soo Jin admitted that she hid the necklace and Eun Soo was the girl of his past, Hyun Woo walks out and goes to Eun Soo. When Hyun Woo gets to Dreaming Forest Villa, he finds that Eun Soo had taken customers to the airport so he makes a plan with an aunt who had also been living with Eun Soo and her father when Eun Soo\'s father became ill. Eun Soo returns from the airport drop off and finds a note saying that her Aunt had left a surprise by the mailbox. She quickly runs to the mailbox to see what it is only to find the letters that she had written to Hyun Woo after he went missing. Sadly she takes out the letters and turns around to leave only to be stopped by a voice asking her if she had found the gift. She turns around to find Hyun Woo who was smiling back at her. At first she pretends to be hateful until he mentions to her about the curse of the necklace. Quickly turning around she finds that he was also wearing the necklace. Hyun Woo tells her that he finally remembers causing her to go up in tears. He promises to never leave Eun Soo\'s side ever again and after staying with Eun Soo at the villa for a couple of days he finally remembered that Tae Min had found Hyun Woo when he was still \'Chang Ho\' at the villa. When he makes it back to the city with Eun Soo, he finds out that Tae Min was the one who caused everything and the reason for it was revenge for Tae Min\'s parents. Back in the past when Tae Min was still a boy, Mr. Kang had deceived Tae Min\'s parents causing them to go bankrupt and ending in suicide leaving Tae Min an orphan. But even after finding this out, he still won\'t get the company back so they created a new item in Hyun Woo\'s own small company rising above other companies. In the end all shareholders return to aid Hyun Woo giving him back his position as director. Tae Min was also found out of fraud shares in the company but he escapes becoming a convict. A friend of Tae Min who has been aiding him since the beginning goes to Eun Soo to ask her to talk Tae Min into turning himself in because he doesn\'t want to see Tae Min look like a total wreck. Eun Soo agrees and goes to the meeting place where the friend was supposed to initially take Hyun Woo so she can talk to Tae Min. Tae Min who was hiding in the dark with his car was getting ready to run over Hyun Woo but doesn\'t know that the person walking towards him was Eun Soo.

"Men\'s souls wrestle with the thought of tomorrow, and today is the eve of tomorrow." he says. His employee Larry Larabee  is worried about the future of their company, but Westlake attempts to placate him by reminding him that the company has survived World War I and the lean years of the Great Depression. Westlake narrates how he became a Coca-Cola bottler and has recently opened a new bottling plant in his town. The scene shifts back several years to the planning stages of the new factory, and Larabee worries about the risk of building a new plant during the Depression. "Right now isn\'t the time to go sinking a lot of money—" he begins, before a co-worker interrupts him: "Right now isn\'t what we\'re building for. It\'s the future". "You talk just like Jim Westlake," Larabee responds, "All he thinks about is tomorrow. Always tomorrow." More scenes from the history of the bottling business follow, illustrating Westlake\'s willingness to spend money and time on new initiatives to grow his business, and the efforts of the company\'s salesmen and dealers. Details such as a Depression-era bank holiday, a 20s-era dance party, and an early wireless  help to place each scene in period context as the film proceeds through its reverse chronological narrative, moving backwards through time to show different moments in the company\'s history. Also illustrated is the development of manufacturing and bottling standards, in which chemists and modern quality-control methods are employed. A cooler to allow Coca-Cola to be sold ice-cold in the store is introduced. Sugar rationing during World War I threatens the company\'s future. The design of the well-known "Coke bottle" shape is said to have been inspired a woman\'s hobble skirt. The final scene of the film shows the business\'s earliest operations. Westlake is denied a loan due to a period of financial uncertainty, presumably the Panic of 1907, but remains confident about his business\'s future. Larabee is shown operating a manual bottling machine, which is slow and difficult to use, contrasting with the automated production line shown early in the film. He complains about the quality of their second-hand equipment, but Westlake remains characteristically optimistic.'] ["Shanmugham  comes to Chennai with his mother in search of his father .

Traveling at 20% the speed of light , it reaches Darwin IV in 42 years. Upon reaching orbit, it deploys the Darwin Reconnaissance Orbiter, which looks for potential landing sites for the probes. The first probe, Balboa, explodes along with its lifting body transport during entry, because one of its wings failed to unfold. Two backup probes, Leonardo da Vinci  and Isaac Newton , successfully land on the planet, and learn much about its bizarre indigenous lifeforms, including an apparently sapient species. The robotic probes sent out to research on Darwin IV are called Horus Probes. Each Horus probe consists of an {{convert}} long inflatable, hydrogen-filled balloon, which is covered with solar receptors, a computer \'brain\', a \'head\' covered with sensors, and several smaller robots that can be sent to places too dangerous for the probes themselves. The probes have a limited degree of artificial intelligence, very similar to the \'processing power\' of a 4-year-old. All the real thinking is done by a supercomputer in the orbiting Von Braun. The probes are programmed with different personalities; Ike is more cautious, while Leo is the risk-taker. The two probes are also equipped with a holographic message that will be projected to any sentient life found on Darwin. After the two probes inflate their gas-bags, they encounter a voracious Arrowtongue and watch it pursue a Gyrosprinter. Later that night, the twins find the wreckage of Balboa and are forced to split up, Ike studying the unique plant life and Leo going after big game. Ike\'s voyage takes him to one of Darwin IV\'s pocket forests, where he encounters a flock of Trunk Suckers and their predator, the Daggerwrist. Before his research is finished, a massive hurricane-like storm hits and Ike must take to the sky, launching weather balloons. Leo goes to the mountain ranges and finds a herd of Unths engaged in rutting-like behavior. Afterward, Leo finds a pair of Bladderhorns engaging in combat. He tries to communicate with one, but a sonic ping interrupts the conversation and scares off the animal, and he is knocked out by a mysterious creature. Ike ventures to the meadows and gullies of Darwin IV, encountering a massive herd of Grovebacks and Littoralopes. It is here that he also encounters a pair of Pterosaur-like Skewers. Leo gets destroyed by a mysterious and evasive creature, and Ike, ordered by the Von Braun to search for Leo\'s attacker, hopes to find a new sentient species. Ike\'s route takes him across perilous terrain, and across the Amoebic Sea in his quest for Leo. As he embarks on his journey, one of the Grovebacks seen earlier falls victim to a swarm of Beach Quills. Ike then finds a pack of Prongheads hunting a Gyrosprinter, and crosses the Amoebic Sea , encountering a herd of giant Sea Striders. Ike manages to find Leo after a harrowing experience with a Skewer which tries to attack him, but before it could it was killed by a spear that was thrown by the newly discovered Eosapien. Shortly afterward, Ike communicates with the Eosapien tribe and discovers that they are truly intelligent. Ike launches a camera disk to record the moment, or perhaps "to assess the threat" due to a third Eosapien appearing; however one of the Eosapiens mistakes it as an attack and destroy the camera disk. Before shutting down, the wrecked camera disk records the Eosapien tribe carrying Ike away. Commentary from notable people discussing the details behind the fictional world of Darwin IV and the likelihood of extraterrestrial life in general is interspersed throughout the movie.'] ["Venu ([[Karthik  and his friend Mukka  work at the graveyard.
