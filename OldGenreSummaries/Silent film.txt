Bowers. Stokes 2007, pp. 190â191.   Stoneman and his mulatto protÃ©gÃ©, Silas Lynch, go to South Carolina in 1871 to observe the situation first hand. Black soldiers parade through the streets. During the election, whites are turned away while blacks stuff the ballot boxes. Lynch is elected Lieutenant Governor. The newly-elected mostly-black legislature is shown at their desks, with one member taking off his shoe and putting his feet up, and others drinking liquor and feasting.

When their wagon breaks down, they make their way to a small hut, home to two former Union soldiers, who agree to hide them. As an intertitle states, "The former enemies of North and South are united again in defense of their Aryan birthright." Austin Stoneman leaves to avoid being connected with Lynch\'s crackdown. Elsie, learning of Dr. Cameron\'s arrest, goes to Lynch to plead for his release. Lynch tries to force Elsie to marry him and she finally faints. Stoneman returns, causing Elsie to be placed in another room, and is happy at first when Lynch tells him he wants to marry a white woman, but is angered when Lynch tells him which one.

She returns home to her parents, Mr and Mrs Bunting, and her policeman sweetheart, Joe , who have been reading the details of the latest Avenger crime in the day\'s paper. Later that same night a new tenant  arrives at the house of Mr. and Mrs. Bunting and inquires about the room they are renting. Mrs. Bunting  takes him to the room on the top floor of her house which is decorated with portraits of beautiful young women, all blondes. The man is rather reclusive and secretive, which puzzles Mrs. Bunting.

In the locked cupboard they find a leather bag containing a gun, a map plotting the location of the Avenger\'s murders, newspapers and a photograph of an attractive blonde woman.

A man and a woman are dancing the tango. Julio strides up and asks to cut in. The woman stares at Julio alluringly. The man brushes him off, and they resume dancing.

As the film begins, Wei Ming is working as a music teacher for a school, even as she harbors dreams of becoming a writer. In the film's opening scene, Wei Ming meets a friend, Yu Haichou  and an old schoolmate, Zhang Xiuzhen , now named Mrs. Wang, on a trolley-car. Wei, Mrs. Wang, and Yu return to Wei's apartment, where Wei receives a phone call from the film's antagonist, the lecherous Dr. Wang , who is also Mrs. Wang's husband. He insists on picking Wei up, even as she ignores his call. As Mrs. Wang leaves, Wei is informed by Yu that one of her books has been accepted for publication. Wei's excitement, however, is soon contrasted as a flashback reveals that the publishing company has only selected her manuscript because she is a young woman. Unaware of this fact, Wei shows Yu a toy she has bought for her young daughter, a product of a failed marriage. She tries to flirt with Yu, but he ignores her advances. Soon, Dr. Wang has picked Wei Ming up and they are on their way to a western-style dancehall. As Wei Ming sits in the car, a flashback is shown on the window of how she met Dr. Wang, a western educated Ph.D. and a member of the board at Wei Ming's school. As Wei Ming and Dr. Wang enter the dance hall, the film contrasts scenes of their dancing with images of Wei Ming's neighbor, Li Aying, a factory worker who leads her fellow workers in learning patriotic songs. With the night winding down, Dr. Wang tries to harass Wei Ming who firmly rejects him. As she flees, she winds up meeting Li and they re-enter their building together. In the mail is a letter from Wei Ming's sister. Wei Ming's daughter, who had been living in the countryside with her aunt, must now come to the city due to financial troubles.

Dr. Wang has convinced the principal of the school to fire Wei Ming and the bills have begun to pile up. Li Aying asks Wei Ming to compose the music for a song, entitled The New Women for her.

Wei Ming is offered help from both her publisher as well as a newspaper reporter, but both make advances on her, which she rejects. Unable to pay for medicine for her child, and with no employment, Wei Ming agrees to become a prostitute. Her first client, coincidentally is Dr. Wang, who flaunts his new-found power over her. Wei, disgusted with herself, runs back to her apartment, with Dr. Wang in hot pursuit. Back in the apartment, Wang and Li come to blows with the effeminate Wang becoming quickly incapacitated. In the middle of this brawl, Mrs. Wang bursts through the door and accuses Wei Ming of seducing her husband. With no money, Wei Ming's daughter succumbs to pneumonia. Distraught, Wei Ming attempts to commit suicide, much to the chagrin of both Li Aying and Yu Haichou. In the hospital, both Li and Yu try to convince Wei that she needs to continue living. As the film ends, Wei Ming cries out that she wants to live. A newspaper obituary announcing her death is shown while a gang of Li Aying's workers march in step."] ["Vertov starts by showing us, with intertitles in giant Cyrillic characters, what he sees  about the capitalist West with its foxtrot and nigger minstrels, and then switches his attention to the audience  and then the individual viewer . In one self-reflexive moment, Vertov even shows cinema-goers watching an earlier piece of the film . He takes us on a tour of the vital importance of agricultural production, which generates export revenue  so that Russia can buy machines to build more machines . This gives him the pretext to take us on a Cookâs tour of the extremities of the Soviet Union: we see the icebreaker Lenin  delivering new dogs to the Samoyeds on Novaya Zemlya, and their being invited on board to listen to a gramophone recording of the great man himself. We go to Bukhara where one of the mosques is looking very dingy and crumbled, and to Leningrad where the trams run down the middle of broad empty boulevard as a horse-drawn carriage turns out. We see a Kirghiz with a giant eagle perched on his arm, a bear encircled by yapping dogs, a fox caught in a trap and another one that is a childâs pet, guillemots, gulls, a man shooting a sable in the top of a pine tree, a pine marten, sheep being dragged into the sea for a wash and other sheep being obliged to jump in to a stream for the same purpose - the intertitles are surreal: (âYou â whether you are washing your sheep in the sea  or whether you are washing your sheep in the river â¦â, We see trappers bringing their furs to the ÐÐ¾ÑÑÐ¾ÑÐ³  trading post in exchange for manufactured goods, everyone contributing to the national economy. Ironically, the furs are destined for the Leipzig fair . In an amazing stop-frame sequence, rows of oranges align themselves in a packing box, wadges of packing material shuffle along and jump on top of them, and then the lids close . We see coke being quenched also, as well as electricity pylons and insulators, and the village electricity co-op. We see sturgeon being hoiked out of tanks to make caviar. We see barrels of butter â 'it is yours!' We see wheat being threshed, linen being spun and cotton being ginned. We see the country being modernised, although there are still some people who trust in Mohammed  or Christ  or Buddha  and we are shown a Siberian shaman looking remarkably like a North American Indian, and even a reindeer being slaughtered  as a sacrifice. We see crowds of women in full-face veils, but also a modernising country as a woman lifts her veil. And we see some tundra-dwellers eating raw reindeer meat. Itâs a fantastic travelogue and anthropological document. Leninâs mausoleum is his alone at this time . The moral: everyone produces and is building socialism. It starts with slavery and ends with developing countries joining the socialist revolution."] ['In the directors\' own words, Chang is a "melodrama with man, the jungle, and wild animals as its cast." Kru, the farmer depicted in the film, battles leopards, tigers, and even a herd of elephants, all of which pose a constant threat to his livelihood. As filmmakers, Cooper and Schoedsack attempted to capture real life with their cameras, though they often re-staged events that had not been captured adequately on film. The danger was real to all the people and animals involved. Tigers, leopards, and bears are slaughtered on camera, while the film\'s climax shows Kru\'s house being demolished by a stampeding elephant. Chang was nominated for the Academy Award for Unique and Artistic Production at the first Academy Awards in 1929, the only year when that award was presented. Chang was released by Famous Players-Lasky, a division of Paramount Pictures.'] ["Irish woman Molly Malone is in love with Paddy O'Reilly, who emigrates to England to better himself.

Though his shyness makes him completely clueless in the art of courting or impressing the ladies, Harold writes a preposterous "how to" book for young men entitled "The Secret of Making Love", detailing what he naively believes is good advice about how to woo different types of young women, such as "the vampire" and "the flapper"  - and takes it to a publisher in Los Angeles by train. The same day, a rich young socialite named Mary Buckingham  has her automobile break down in Little Bend and boards the same train. No dogs are allowed aboard, so she hides her Pekinese under her shawl, but her pet jumps off as the train pulls away. Harold rescues her dog and helps Mary hide it from the conductor. She sees his manuscript, so he starts telling her about his book, overcoming his stuttering in his enthusiasm. They become so absorbed in each other that neither realizes that the train has reached its destination and everyone else has departed. Upon returning home, Mary rejects the latest in a string of proposals of marriage from her persistent suitor, Ronald DeVore. After her car is repaired, Mary intentionally detours through Little Bend repeatedly, hoping to meet Harold again. On one such trip, Ronald is also along for the ride, and his unwanted attentions during yet another unsuccessful marriage proposal cause the flustered Mary to accidentally swerve off the road and get her car stuck near the outskirts of Little Bend. While Ronald walks back to town for a tow, Mary serendipitously runs into Harold, who is relaxing in a rowboat in a nearby stream. When Harold tells Mary that he is going to see the publisher, Roger Thornby, in a few days to deliver a new chapter for his book that he plans to write about her, they agree to meet afterward. Meanwhile, back in town, Ronald unexpectedly runs into a middle-aged woman who asks if he is finally going to take her home with him and introduce her to his family, but he stalls her, then rides away in the tow-vehicle. Mr. Thornby\'s professional readers find Harold\'s book hilariously absurd, so he informs Harold that it has been rejected. Without any royalty money, Harold figures he cannot ask a rich girl like Mary to marry him. When he sees her, instead of telling her the truth, he pretends that he was only using her as part of his research, and that he really is not interested in her. Heartbroken and lonesome, Mary impulsively agrees to marry Ronald even though she has never really liked him. Afterward, though, one of Mr. Thornby\'s senior employees convinces the publisher that, if the staff liked the book so much, there must be a market for it, so Thornby decides to publish the book after retitling it "The Boob\'s Diary", a spoof on the popular romantic-advice books of the time{{Citation needed}}. Back in the tailor shop a few days later, a depressed Harold sees an envelope from the publisher that arrives in the morning mail, but he just rips it up without even opening it, assuming that it is a formal rejection notice. Fortunately, his uncle notices that one of the scraps is part of an advance royalty check for $3,000. At first, Harold is outraged and insulted to have his "pride and joy" ridiculed, but then he quickly swallows his indignation upon realizing that the royalty money means that he could probably propose to Mary after all. His elation is short-lived, however, when he sees a newspaper story announcing Mary and Ronald\'s wedding which is scheduled for that same day at her family\'s estate. Thinking all is lost, Harold gives up. However, by chance, the same woman whom Ronald had met in town a few days earlier walks in and, seeing the story, tearfully exclaims that she is Ronald\'s wife. As proof, she shows Harold a photo locket with the couple\'s wedding portrait and the engraved words "to my wife" that Ronald had given her two years earlier. Harold takes the locket and races to stop the wedding, in a frenzied headlong-dash trip involving bootleggers, car chases and multiple changes of vehicle  through the countryside and along the crowded streets of Culver City and Los Angeles. Eventually arriving at Buckingham Estate with only moments to spare, Harold bursts in just as the minister is about to conclude the wedding ceremony, but he cannot stop stuttering long enough to expose Ronald\'s intended bigamy. So Harold whisks Mary up over his shoulder and carries her off. When they are alone, he tells her about Ronald and shows her the locket as proof. Mary, visibly relieved that she won\'t have to marry Ronald after all, and immensely grateful for Harold\'s heroic dash to save her from scandal, quickly forgives Harold\'s previous deceptions now that she sees that he truly did care about her all along, and she gets Harold to propose to her , and she accepts.'] ['Two German cruisers escape to the Pacific and begin to raid the Australian coast.

When Tom and Helen receive a letter from Harry, in which he announces he will travel to them for a vacation, they see an opportunity to get a break from the kids. Knowing that Harry is an expert on children, they assume that he will appreciate the gesture and leave just after he arrives.

He reluctantly takes the position as the babysitter of his nieces and is escorted by Alice Mayton, the Lawrence's attractive neighbor. It soon becomes clear that Harry won't get any rest, as the careless girls often annoy him by getting themselves into danger or going through his possessions. Many of the dangerous situations Toodie gets herself into include climbing a tree and attempting to shave herself. Although they always try to help him out, Toodie and Budge only make things worse.

The proprietor hires the poet to write a back-story for his wax models of Harun al-Rashid , Ivan the Terrible , and Jack the Ripper  in order to draw an audience to the museum. With the daughter by his side, the poet notices that the arm of Harun al-Rashid is missing and writes a story incorporating the missing arm.  The poet sees himself in his story as a pie baker, Assad, where he lives with his wife directly by the walls of the palace where Harun Al-Rashid lives. Smoke from the Assads\' bakery covers the front of the palace, where Al-Rashid loses a game of chess, leading him to want the head of the baker. He sends his Grand Vizier to find the man, Assad, but in doing so, he finds Assad\'s wife with whom he is enchanted. After being captivated by her beauty and also captivating her with his status among the royals, he returns to tell Al-Rashid that he does not have the baker\'s head but rather something better - his wife. Al-Rashid then resolves to go out that night, incognito, and visit the beauty. When he steals away from his castle, the ruler witnesses an argument between the jealous Assad and Maimune, who both seem dissatisfied with their poverty-laden life. Assad then says he will rob Al-Rashid\'s wishing ring to solve their problems. While Al-Rashid visits the bakery that night, Assad robs the wishing ring off the wax figurine of Al-Rashid by slicing the arm of the figurine, and is spotted by his guards and is chased out of the palace. Meanwhile, Al-Rashid tries to impress Assad\'s wife. The returning Assad penetrates the locked house by force, while Maimune hides Al-Rashid in the baking-oven. The guards rush in to arrest Assad, but Assad\'s wife uses the wishing ring to make Al-Rashid "appear" as he secretly comes out of the oven. After this, they come to an agreement where Assad becomes the official baker for Al-Rashid.  {{Expand section|dateJack the Ripper After the poet finishes the last two stories, he wakes up to find that the wax model of Jack the Ripper has come to life, but it is recognized instead to be Spring-heeled Jack. Spring-Heeled Jack stalks both the poet and the waxwork owner\'s daughter. The Poet and the girl flee but find that they can\'t escape Spring-Heeled Jack through the dark, twisted halls of the museum. As Jack draws close enough, multiple versions of him appear, and as his knife begins to slash, it provokes the poet to wake up to realize that the last experience was a dream. Occasionally, Jack the Ripper was referred to as "birdner" because of his ability to travel around like a bird.'] ['A synopsis of the film, as reported in an October 31, 1915 Paramount Pictures Corporation advertisement in the Ledger-Enquirer : "John and Jane Stuart have been bought up with strict old-fashioned conservatism by their Aunt Angela, so great has been the effect upon Jane that she does no even garb herself in modest gowns, but adheres to the styles long since abandoned by society. The aunt\'s extreme economy builds a false barrier between the Stuart children and the Monroe family, their next-door neighbors, with the exception of Stanley Hudson, who becomes a constant visitor at the Monroe home after he has caught a glimpse of Jane over the garden wall. The attraction proves mutual and the friendship ripens rapidly. Meanwhile John, Jane\'s brother, has found the life of Puritanical abstention irksome in the extreme, and has fallen in with a rather wild element whose chief pastime is gambling. Only the quick action of Jane enables him to escape the well-deserved wrath of his aunt.  A sudden turn in the tide of the Stuart\'s affairs comes when Jane inherits a huge fortune. The first effect is seen in John, who promptly sells out to live the sort of existence he has always craved. Jane, however, continues to live in the same old way, and to wear the same old clothes. The sudden acquisition of wealth makes the Stuarts a great desideratum  in those circles from which they had been previously barred. At a reception at the Monroe\'s, Jane appears in one of her old gowns the very simplicity of which, in sharp contrast to the gorgeous apparel of the other girls, makes her the belle of the evening. Later, in deference to John\'s wishes, she arrays herself in resplendent glory according to the latent edicts of Paris and emerges from the modiste\'s an exquisite vision of loveliness.  Stanley\'s social standing has captured the imagination of one of the season\'s debuntantes who declares war upon the unsuspecting Jane. Other wiles failing, the enamored one, finally bribes an aviator to take Jane into his aeroplane and lose her in order to prevent her from arriving at the boat landing to embark upon a criuse on which they have all been invited. On the first day out Stanley\'s attempt to propose to Jane is interrupted by the other girl who, later stages a little scene with Stanley that causes poor Jane untold anguish of heart.  But fate takes a turn for the better and John\'s wild speculations are changed from lesses to gains while Stanley suddenly spurred to action claims the prise which was his for the asking."   From an October 11, 1915 review of the film in the Portland Oregonian: "Little Miss Mary, with her wobbly curls, piquant face and winning ways, drew capacity audiences all yesterday at the Peoples Theater in \'A girl of Yesterday\'. In this Frohman production Mary Pickford is supported by her clever brother, Jack Pickford. The film is the initial screen appearance of Glenn Martin, the aviator. As Jane Stuart, whose poverty keeps her from vogish apparel, \'Little Mary\' becomes loved both by members of the smart set and by Stanley Hudson . The intrigue of rivals causes Jane to be taken up in an aeroplane and left unchaperoned ten miles from the party. A pathetic scene occurs when, on her return, her plutocratic hostess asks her to leave. Her brother, disappointed in his love affair, attempts suicide and is rescued by Jane. Deciding they are out of place, the brother and sister return home. Stanley, however, remains true and so does Jack\'s sweetheart, so the ending is happy." <gallery> File:Girl From Yesterday Still.gif|Promotional Still from the film File:Shot with martin.jpg|A photograph of a scene being filmed of Glenn Martin and Mary Pickford </gallery>'] ["Silent Madden, a criminal leader in San Francisco, and his gangster daughter Molly  have forsaken a life of crime after receiving counsel from Chang Lo, a Confucianist philosopher living in Chinatown.

He therefore has a law passed by the National Assembly forcing all Jews to emigrate by the end of the year. The law is enthusiastically received by the non-Jewish population, and the Jews leave the country. But after a short time a sober reality makes itself felt. Cultural life becomes impoverished: in the theatres only plays by Ludwig Ganghofer and Ludwig Anzengruber are still performed. Many cafes are empty, or are converted into beer halls selling sausages. After an initial upturn, the economy declines, as business has greatly diminished, and has moved to other cities, such as Prague and Budapest. Inflation and unemployment run wild. The political characters of the book  are delineated in such a way as to be identifiable with real politicians of the period: Bundeskanzler Schwerdtfeger, for example, is based on Ignaz Seipel. Besides the political action, the film also dwells on the love relationship between Lotte , a typical Viennese girl  and the daughter of a member of the National Assembly who voted for the banishment of the Jews, and the Jewish artist Leo Strakosch . Towards the end of the film the National Assembly resolves to bring the Jews back again. However, in order to achieve the necessary two-thirds majority, Lotte and Leo, who has already illegally returned to Austria with forged papers identifying him as a French painter, have to remove the anti-Semitic Parliamentary representative Bernard (played by [[Hans Moser , which they do by getting him drunk. The drama reaches a peak as he is committed to a psychiatric institution represented in Expressionist scenery, where in a claustrophobic and asymmetrically painted cell he sees himself threatened by Stars of David. This sequence also represents the divergence of the film from the book, as the action of the film is revealed as a dream of the anti-Semitic Councillor Bernard. This surprising turn of events was described in the original film programme as follows: "In this moment of the highest distress Councillor Bernard awakes from his dream, finds himself in the tavern at a very late hour and says to the baffled Volbert: \'Thank God that stupid dream is over - we are all just people and we don\'t want hate - we want life - we want to live together in peace.\'""Gottlob, daÃ der dumme Traum vorbei ist â wir sind ja alle nur Menschen und wollen keinen HaÃ â Leben wollen wir â ruhig nebeneinander leben".

After the loss of his parents, Poe is taken in by the John and Francis Allan in Richmond, Virginia. The film then jumps ahead about 15 years to Poe\'s time at the University of Virginia. Due to debts from playing cards and a growing interest in wine, Poe begins to have difficulties. He hallucinates that he has killed a man in a pistol duel. Poe meets Virginia and they spend a day together, riding a horse and sitting "beside the glassy pool of romance." He tells her a fairy tale, a raven perching on Poe\'s shoulder as he finishes the story, before they go on a walk together. Upon seeing a black slave  being whipped, he buys the slave with an "I.O.U." for $600.00. The slave\'s former owner then goes to John Allan to collect the debt. Allan calls Poe a "scoundrel" for causing so many bills. After having a drink with his "chum" Tony, Poe goes to visit Virginia. Tony follows shortly after and the two compete for Virginia\'s affection. Later, Virginia says she will choose the man who guesses which hand holds a wreath behind her back. Poe allows Tony to go first and, though he guesses correctly, Virginia secretly switches the wreath to the other hand so that Poe can win. Shortly after, in front of Tony and Virginia, Allan questions Poe\'s spending habits. Allan causes quite a scene, despite his wife\'s attempts to calm him. Poe is asked to leave the Allan family but Virginia offers to come along. Poe\'s recently-purchased slave comes along as well. Poe has an alcohol-induced hallucination that recreates his poem  "The Raven". As Poe sits alone, he hears a tapping at the chamber door. The door knocker moves on its own and Poe thinks he sees the outline of a large, black bird. As Poe stumbles outside, the word "wine" appearing on a rock he braces himself against, he sees a ghost. As he reaches for another sip of wine, a human skull appears in place of the glass. Finally, a raven makes its way into the room, repeating the word "Nevermore" as Poe attempts to talk to it. Poe, in Fordham, New York, is in "dire poverty" along with Virginia and her mother Maria. Virginia has a terrible coughing fit, a sign of her tuberculosis. Poe, desperate for money, unsuccessfully attempts to sell some of his work to George Rex Graham. Virginia, bothered by the cold winter weather, is kept warm by Poe\'s old coat from his time at West Point and from their pet black cat. She dies the next day, causing Poe great grief. Sarah Helen Whitman is introduced at the end of the film, assisting an elderly couple. She and Poe, however, do not cross paths.'] ["17-year-old Tess Skinner is the daughter of a squatter, and wealthy man Elias Graves, who owns the land, is trying to get rid of them and the other squatter families.

The Mother's similar history from years past is presented in flashbacks."] ['We see Mary Magdalene, here portrayed as a wild courtesan, entertain many men around her. Upon learning that Judas is with a carpenter she rides out on her chariot drawn by zebras to get him back. Peter is introduced as the Giant apostle, and we see the future gospel writer Mark as a child who is healed by Jesus. The Virgin Mary is shown as a beautiful and saintly woman who is a mother to all her son\'s followers. Our first sight of Jesus is through the eyesight of a little girl, whom He heals. He is surrounded by a halo. Mary Magdelene arrives afterwards and talks to Judas, who reveals that he is only staying with Jesus in hopes of being made a king after Jesus becomes the king of kings. Jesus casts the Seven Deadly Sins out of Mary Magdalene in a multiple exposure sequence. Jesus is also shown resurrecting Lazarus and healing the little children. Some humor is derived when one girl asks if He can heal broken legs and He says yes, she gives him a legless doll. Jesus smiles and repairs the doll. The crucifixion is foreshadowed when Jesus, having helped a poor family, wanders through the father\'s carpentry shop and, himself a carpenter\'s son, briefly helps carve a piece of wood. When a sheet covering the object is removed, it is revealed to be a cross towering over Jesus. Jesus and His apostles enter Jerusalem, where Judas incites the people and rallies them to proclaim Jesus King of the Jews. Jesus, however, renounces all claims of being an Earthly king. Caiaphas the High Priest is also angry at Judas for having led people to a man whom he sees as a false prophet. Meanwhile Jesus drives away Satan who offers Him an Earthly kingdom, and he protects the woman caught in adultery. The words he draws in the sand are revealed to be the sins the accusers themselves committed. Judas, desperate to save himself from Caiaphas, agrees to turn over Jesus. Noticeably at the Last Supper, when Jesus distributes the bread and wine saying that they are His body and blood, Judas refuses to eat. He puts the cup to his lips but refuses to drink; he tears off a piece of bread but lets it drop to the ground. Towards the end, Mary confronts her son and tells Him to flee the danger that is coming. Jesus replies that it must be done for the salvation of all peoples. They leave the room but the camera focuses on the table where a dove flies on and stays for a moment. Jesus goes to the Garden of Gethsemane where He is soon captured by the Roman soldiers and betrayed by Judas. Judas\' life is saved, but on seeing that Jesus is going to be killed he is horrified. He takes a rope that the Romans had used to bind Jesus\' wrists and runs off. Jesus is beaten and then presented by Pontius Pilate to the crowd. Mary pleads for the life of her son and Mary Magdalene speaks for Him but Caiaphas bribes the crowd to shout against Jesus. Jesus is taken away to be crucified, though He pauses the Via Dolorosa to heal a group of cripples in an alley, regardless of His weakened condition. He is crucified and His enemies throw insults at Him.  When Jesus does die, however, a great earthquake comes up. The tree where Judas had hanged himself with the rope used to bind Jesus\'s wrists is swallowed up amidst gouts of hellfire. The sky turns black, lightning strikes, the wind blows, the people who had mocked Jesus run on terror, and the veil covering the Holy of Holies in the Jerusalem Temple is torn in two. The tumult ends when Mary looks up at heaven and asks God to forgive the world for the death of their son. The chaos ends and the sun shines. Jesus is taken down from the cross and is buried. On the third day, He rises from the dead as promised. To emphasize the importance of the resurrection, this scene from an otherwise black and white film is shot in color. Jesus goes to the Apostles and tells them to spread His message to the world. He tells them "I am with you always" as the scene shifts to a modern city to show that Jesus still watches over His followers. Many of the film\'s intertitles are quotes  from Scripture, often with chapter and verse accompanying.'] ['A Hungarian carnival troupe follows a young girl who reforms a tearaway after her old suitor tried to kill him with a poisonous lizard.'] ["Mary and her cousin Clairborne are the last descendants of the Lane family who announce they are selling their land.

When they bring the horse to the painting\'s owner, he speaks to them from an upstairs window where he can\'t see the steed; he tells them to bring Blue Boy in the house and put "him" on the piano. This triggers a running gag where Ollie explains patiently to Stan that , the rich are different from you and me. He punctuates his lesson with a twisting gesture of his hand to demonstrate the 180-degree difference between the classes. The three come clumping through the front door while the millionaire upstairs takes a bath â "and it ain\'t even Saturday," a title card informs us. Ollie has an altercation with a nude statue, which snaps into three pieces after the two tumble to the floor; Hardy, ever the gentleman, safeguards the statue\'s modesty by wrapping its bare torso in his coat while he reassembles it. When the statue\'s back upright and Ollie removes the coat, the torso segment is backwards, so its backside protrudes out from where its midriff should be. Wrong again! Meanwhile, the suddenly obstreperous Blue Boy has taken to chasing Stanley around the house, while a cross-cut reveals that the police have recovered the Blue Boy painting and are making plans to return it. Working together, The Boys manage to lead the horse over to the grand piano, and up he leaps to his high perch. Shots of the millionaire upstairs in his tub reveal that he\'s at least hearing the commotion below. Things seem fine â Blue Boy is placidly up on the piano as his owner has asked â when suddenly a piano leg gives way and Ollie is left literally holding things up, about a ton of piano and horse. Stan rises to his usual degree of helpfulness as the horse, in a bravura performance, keeps nudging his derby off his head and Stan opts to keep retrieving the hat rather than help with the crisis at hand. They finally get the piano leg wedged back under the instrument, but not before Ollie\'s head gets squished between the two. The three agents of The Boys\' undoing all then converge in a perfect storm of bad luck: the millionaire\'s mother returns home , the police arrive with the real Blue Boy, the recovered painting, and the refreshed millionaire descends from his bath to reveal the misunderstanding. Ollie twiddles his tie, apologies for the "faux pas" and he and Stan and Blue Boy make a hasty exit, followed by the irate millionaire with a shotgun. In the process, the priceless painting gets knocked to the floor on top of one of the detectives, whose face pops through the canvas in the exact right spot, replacing Blue Boy\'s face. The short ends with a favorite Roach finale â a gag at the expense of a cop. This one has the officer as the literal butt of the joke: his rump is still smoking from the pellets delivered by the millionaire\'s shotgun.'] ["Marie Skinner  is a gold digger with her hooks out for devoted middle-aged family man J.C.

He is a rich, upper-class gentleman whose romance is endangered when his girlfriend oversees him being embraced by a maid. Chaplin\'s romantic interest in this film, Minta Durfee, was the wife of fellow Keystone actor, Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle.'] ["The film centers around Stan and Ollie being hired as waiters at an upper class dinner party and subsequently not making a very good job of it. The film starts with Stan and Ollie arriving at the host's house, with Ollie taking charge before even entering the property . The maid shows them inside, where Stan puts their personal card on table with a collection of others. Visible on their card is the slogan, âAll we ask is a chanceâ. A small fight breaks out between Ollie and Stan as a result of Ollie trying to keep Stan from putting his hat on inside the house. After the wife of the household inspects them she gets shown a notice apologizing that the only available waiters were the duo, where it is revealed on the paper that their previous experience in waiting was at railroad eating houses. Ollie comments to the wife's husband that she is âsome wiggler!â  and naturally, the husband isn't impressed. The pair get ready to start work in the kitchen where Stan tells the chef  not to wear his hat. Stan takes it off him several times but the chef proceeds to keep putting it back on. Stan soon loses his cool and throws the chefs hat away. The chef retaliates by grabbing the nearest plate and smashing it over Stan's head. Stan does the same back to the chef and they carry on using plates as weapons until Ollie calms things down by stopping Stan from destroying a large, expensive looking plate. However, as Ollie walks off, he trips on the kitchen floor and smashes the plate, causing him to be embarrassed by the onlooking maid. Meanwhile the party goes on, oblivious to the impending disaster awaiting them. The wife of the household isn't having an easy time either, as she struggles to eat her fruit cocktail with the cutlery provided. Her predicament carries on throughout the film. Stan and Ollie come into the room as they are about to start serving food. Stan manages to pour, what looks like soup, onto Ollie's foot while he counts the guests. Ollie begins carrying a very large cake to the table but slips on a banana skin left by the family dog and lands head first into the cake. Ollie manages to do this more than once in the film, much to the bemusement of the guests, and of Stan, who accuses him of falling over on purpose at one point. The pair spend most of the film falling down while trying to serve the food, much to the anger of the husband of the household. This is one of the first films to show Stan getting cross for once, as he loses his temper with Ollie's incompetence and with the guests. The wife then asks Ollie to serve the salad âundressedâ. Ollie tells Stan to do this who, confused, heads to the kitchen to tell the maid what he has to do. The maid says, âI always serve it that way...â. Stan can't believe this but goes ahead and dresses down to his underwear to serve the salad. The film ends with the husband and wife discovering Stan undressed, and after a futile attempt by Ollie to put a jacket on Stan and ask, âHow's that - perfect?â, Ollie gets hit by the wife and falls into yet another cake."] ["The story deals with the mutiny on {{HMS}}, Captain Bligh's journey back to England, the recapture of the mutineers on Tahiti and subsequent fate of the other mutineers on Pitcairn Island.{{cite news}}"] ['Jack enlists in the Royal Australian Navy  and after training on the Tingira, joins the crew of {{HMAS}}.

Francis  and an elderly companion are sharing stories when a distracted-looking woman, Jane , passes by. Francis calls her his betrothed and narrates an interesting tale that he and Jane share. Francis begins his story with himself and his friend Alan , who are both good-naturedly competing to be married to the lovely Jane. The two friends visit a carnival in their German mountain village of Holstenwall, where they encounter the captivating Dr. Caligari  and a near-silent somnambulist, Cesare , whom the doctor keeps asleep in a coffin-like cabinet, controls hypnotically, and is displaying as an attraction. Caligari hawks that Cesare\'s continuous sleeping state allows him to know the answer to any question about the future. When Alan asks Cesare how long he will live, Cesare bluntly replies that Alan will die before dawn tomorrow&mdash;a prophecy which is fulfilled. Alan\'s violent death at the hands of some shadowy figure becomes the most recent in a series of mysterious murders in Holstenwall. Francis, along with Jane, to whom he is now officially engaged, investigates Caligari and Cesare, which eventually results in Caligari\'s order for Cesare to murder Jane. Cesare nearly does so, revealing to Francis the almost certain connection of Cesare and his master Caligari to the recent homicides; however, Cesare refuses to go through with the killing because of Jane\'s beauty and he instead carries her out of her house, pursued by the townsfolk. Finally, after a long chase, Cesare releases Jane, falls over from exhaustion, and dies. In the meantime, Francis goes to the local insane asylum to ask if there has ever been a patient there by the name of Caligari, only to be shocked to discover that Caligari is the asylum\'s director. With the help of some of Caligari\'s oblivious colleagues at the asylum, Francis discovers through old records that the man known as "Dr. Caligari" is obsessed with the story of a mythical monk called Caligari, who, in 1093, visited towns in northern Italy and similarly used a somnambulist under his control to kill people. Dr. Caligari, insanely driven to see if such a situation could actually occur, deemed himself "Caligari" and has since successfully carried out his string of proxy murders. Francis and the asylum\'s other doctors send the authorities to Caligari\'s office, where Caligari reveals his lunacy only when told that his beloved slave Cesare has died; Caligari is then imprisoned in his own asylum. The narrative returns to the present moment, with Francis concluding his tale. A twist ending reveals that Francis\' flashback, however, is actually his fantasy: he, Jane and Cesare are all in fact inmates of the insane asylum, and the man he says is Caligari is his asylum doctor, who, after this revelation of the source of his patient\'s delusion, says that now he will be able to cure Francis.'] ['Richard Gannon discovers his wife Amy has been cheating on him with a man called Jim Williams and accidentally kills her in a fit of anger by pushing her over a cliff.

The journal features sketches of dinosaurs which is enough proof for Challenger to publicly announce that dinosaurs still walk the earth. Met with ridicule at an academic meeting at the Zoological Hall, Challenger reluctantly accepts a newspaper\'s offer to finance a mission to rescue Maple White. Professor Challenger, Paula White, sportsman Sir John Roxton, news reporter Edward Malone , a sceptical professor Summerlee, an Indian servant Zambo, and Challenger\'s butler Austin leave for the plateau. At their campsite at the base of the plateau, the explorers are shocked when a large rock falls, sent their way by an ape-man perched on top of an overhead ledge. As the crew look up to see their attacker, Challenger spies overhead a Pteranodon  which sighting proves that the statements in Maple White\'s diary are true. Leaving Zambo and Austin at the camp, they cross a chasm onto the plateau by cutting down a tree and using it as a bridge, but it is knocked over by an Apatosaurus, leaving them trapped. The explorers witness various life-and-death struggles between the prehistoric beasts of the plateau. An Allosaurus attacks an Anatotitan, and knocks it into a bog. The Allosaurus then attacks, and is driven off by a Triceratops. Eventually, the Allosaurus makes its way to the campsite and attacks the exploration party. It is finally driven off by Ed who tosses a torch into its mouth. Convinced that the camp isn\'t safe, Ed climbs a tree to look for a new location, but is attacked by the ape-man. Roxton succeeds in shooting the ape-man, but the creature is merely wounded and escapes before he can finish him off. Meanwhile, an Agathaumas is attacked by a Tyrannosaurus, and gores it to death. Suddenly, another Tyrannosaurus attacks and kills the Agathaumas, along with an unfortunate Pteranodon. The explorers then make preparations to live on the plateau potentially indefinitely. A catapult is constructed and during a search for Maple White, Roxton finds his remains, confirming his death. It is at this time that Ed confesses his love for Paula and the two are unofficially wed by Summerlee who used to be a minister. Shortly afterwards, as the paleontologists are observing a Brontosaurus, an Allosaurus attacks it and the Brontosaurus falls off the edge of the plateau, becoming trapped in a mud bank at the base of the plateau. Soon afterwards, a volcano erupts causing a mass stampede among the giant beasts of the lost world. The crew is saved when Paula\'s pet monkey Jocko climbs up the plateau carrying a rope. The crew use the rope to pull up a rope ladder constructed by Zambo and Austin and then climb down. As Ed makes his descent, he is again attacked by the ape-man who pulls the rope ladder. The ape-man is again shot and finally killed by Roxton. They discover the Brontosaurus that had been pushed off the plateau had landed softly in the mud of the river, trapped but still alive, and Challenger manages to bring it back to London, as he wants to put it on display as proof of his story. However, while being unloaded from the ship it escapes and causes havoc until it reaches Tower Bridge, where its massive weight causes a collapse, and it swims down the River Thames. Challenger is morose as the creature leaves. Ed discovers that the love he left in London has married in his absence, allowing him and Paula to be together. Roxton morosely but gallantly hides his love for Paula as Paula and Ed leave together, while two passersby note: "That\'s Sir John Roxton--sportsman."'] ["The film concerns a student, Ch'oe Yeongjin, who has become mentally ill after being imprisoned and tortured by the Japanese for his involvement in the March 1, 1919 protest against the Japanese colonial rule.

Tully , an effete and completely mother-in-law-dominated new husband becomes unwittingly involved in boxer Hudson\'s plot to wrest his girlfriend\'s  $5000 necklace from her in order to pay his gambling debts. Living next door to Maggie, the exotic dancer, Tully is first introduced to her only because his mother-in-law demands that he go next door and make the noise ceaseânoise from one of Maggie\'s hedonist parties. That evening, purely by coincidence, Tully accompanies his other neighbor, John Ayres, to the club at which Maggie performs as a singer/dancer , his wife and MIL having left town to visit aunty. It is at this club that Tully accidentally acquires the necklace and so, the rest of the farce is taken up with scenes of mistaken identities, moments of being in the wrong places at the wrong times, misunderstandings with wives, stepmothers, and boxer boyfriends, etc. In the end, Hudson is arrested for trying to steal the necklace back from Tully\'s apartment and all falls back into orderâexcept that Tully has NOT managed to lose his mother-in-law along the way. This film is highlighted by intricate gags, including using a pekinese puppy to moisten stamps, a fantastic spinning headstand by Chaplin, and, perhaps, marred a bit by a lack of plot and an unbearably long scene at the nightclub in which Chaplin mistakes a female "little person" for a little girl. This film definitely follows along well from the sort of character Chaplin created in his Warner Brothers contractâa winning one for him.'] ['Zara  is a gypsy rogue who joins with Confederate Zazarack  to aid Michael Nash , the crooked guardian of heiress Doris Merrick , to gain control of her estate by way of fake seances.'] ["1877: The most important family in Hickoryville is  the Hickorys, with sheriff Jim and his tough manly sons Leo and Olin.

However, their wedding must be postponed because Klaha is summoned from England to Romania on business. Klaha goes to Transylvania, and arrives at the Earl of Dracula\'s castle, where he is staying. The Earl seems welcoming, but Klaha has strange experiences while staying there. On his arrival, he notices a painting of the Earl\'s deceased wife, who looks very much like Cecil. 2 nights later, the Earl agrees to buy a house in England. That same night, after having a nightmare, Klaha wakes up to see a coffin leaving the grounds. While looking for the Earl, Klaha sees the painting again, but this time, the word "Cecil" is written under it. Too late does Klaha realise that the Earl is a vampire. He immediately leaves to try to catch up with him. Meanwhile, back in London, Cecil starts having dreams about the Earl of Dracula. She confesses those dreams to Mana, disguised as a nun, who tells her to pray about it. During Klaha\'s stay, she, unaware that Klaha is already going back, receives a letter  informing her that Klaha must stay an additional night, thus upsetting her. On the night that Klaha is returning, KÃ¶zi visits Cecil to drink her blood . The Earl, however, sees this occur, and sends Mana to stop him. After a confrontation in which she uses roses as knives, KÃ¶zi demands to know why she is attacking him; Mana tells him that Cecil is "the Earl\'s Virgin Bride." At hearing this, KÃ¶zi realises that the Earl wants to remain immortal. After a flashback which reveals their pasts , KÃ¶zi calls Mana a hypocrite, since she sold her soul for revenge. Mana responds, "I believe in God so I can keep my self-respect!"; hearing this, KÃ¶zi leaves in anger. Several nights later, the Earl\'s coffin arrives at the Church. The Earl wakes up, and Mana brings him a girl . He bites the girl\'s neck, and immediately, he gains his youthful appearance back. He then proceeds to kill the deliverymen who brought him in. The next day, he darkens the day sky and meets Cecil, who he immediately recognises by her respective locket ; he reappears during that moment to give her locket back to her. That same evening, the Earl finally visits Cecil. After several moments, the Earl bites down her neck.

Upon his return, he discovers that Cecil is ill, and her parents don\'t know what to do. Klaha then sees the two bite marks on Cecil\'s neck and informs everyone, "A vampire did this"; he then shows his two bite marks. Klaha realises that he is once again too late to stop the Earl, and says, "Now I\'ll really need help!" while a vision of the Earl holding the town in terror appears. The scene shifts back to the beginning of the film proper: Klaha, Cecil\'s father, a priest, and a doctor attempt to exorcise Cecil in an attempt to lure out the Earl. Suddenly, the Earl of Dracula appears. Klaha attempts to shoot the Earl through the neck, but he immediately recovers. He sets Cecil free. The priest attempts to stop him, but the Earl manages to throw the priest\'s crucifix on the ground. He then kills the priest by breaking his neck, stabs Cecil\'s father, and slits the doctor\'s throat. Klaha makes one last attempt to stop the Earl and Cecil from escaping, but they escape anyway . KÃ¶zi then appears in the room. Klaha is frightened at first, but KÃ¶zi assures him that he will not harm him, revealing where they are hidden: underneath the church. KÃ¶zi tells Klaha he must kill Dracula and Mana, the latter because of one reason, as KÃ¶zi explains: "The more an adept believer of God you are, the more horrible the experience will be," reminding Klaha of the death of the priest. Before they leave, KÃ¶zi reminds Klaha: "Don\'t forget to kill him!", which Klaha promises to do. They go to the church, where a ritual is under way to make Cecil the Earl\'s wife. Klaha appears in an attempt to stop the Earl and Mana. He draws his gun, only to see the Earl attempt to bite his neck to kill him.

During the fight, Mana attempts to escape, but is found out by the Earl, and is used by him as a human shield, protecting him from a blow that was meant for him. The ferocity of the Earl\'s attacks increase as a result from this. KÃ¶zi, however, instead of continuing the fight, surprises everyone by stabbing himself in the gut. KÃ¶zi asks Klaha to kill him, and he does. Klaha then goes to Cecil. At first, she seems to have recovered. However, her eyes turn red and she bares her fangs at him, proving she is still a vampire. The female vampire tells Klaha to kill Cecil before dying herself, begging him to "Please stop [Cecil\'s] breath." Klaha attempts to do so, only to be prevented by the Earl, who, although injured, is still alive. Cecil drinks his blood again . While this goes on, Klaha takes advantage and stabs the Earl 2 times with his sword, outraging Cecil. Klaha then turns his sword to Cecil, and he manages to stab her 3 times. Before going for a fourth, he hesitates and lowers his sword. He then does something familiar: he stabs his hand to allow Cecil to drink his blood. The scene ends with Cecil giving a familiar expression, and it\'s revealed that Klaha was a vampire all along; he was biting her neck . In the final scene, Klaha, in his vampire form, wakes up, as if from a nightmare, suggesting that perhaps the whole events which occurred in the film were all inside of Klaha\'s mind. Cecil  sits up beside him and smiles. The film ends with Klaha walking down the aisle, carrying Cecil in his arms. The final intertitle states their feelings for each other: "The only one I want is you."'] ['The plot revolves around the gang swapping places with a group of runaway boys who are supposed to be taken by train back to San Francisco.

They get into a heated argument and McTeague beats Trina to death then steals her $5,000. Now an outlaw, McTeague returns to a life in the mines until he "senses danger" and flees in the night, narrowly avoiding bounty hunters. McTeague then teams up with a prospector named Cribbens , and the pair set out looking for something to mine and make their own fortunes. Heading towards Death Valley, they find a large quantity of quartz, and so set themselves up as millionaires. Before they can begin mining, McTeague once again "senses danger" in the night, and flees into Death Valley with a single horse, the remaining money, and one water jug. Several marshals are pursuing McTeauge, including Marcus Schouler, who saw the wanted poster and is able to help identify McTeague. The marshals circle around Death Valley to cut McTeague off at the other side. Schouler wants to catch him personally and, having been given a set of handcuffs and a pistol, rides into Death Valley alone. The oppressive heat causes McTeague\'s progress to slow down and eventually stops him from moving forward. Schouler\'s progress is also beginning to wane when he spies McTeague lying in the sand and moves in to make his arrest. After a confrontation, McTeague tells Schouler that the rest of the money is on his horse, along with the only water he has remaining. The horse, having eaten "locoweed", decides to bolt, and it seems the easiest and most beneficial thing to do is have Schouler put the horse down. Schouler\'s bullets stop the horse, but also puncture the drink container, spilling the water onto the desert floor. The pair, delirious from heat, fight one last time, with McTeague proving the victor; however, Schouler had snapped the cuffs on McTeague, who is now bound to Schouler\'s corpse. Assessing his situation: In the desert with no horse, no water, unable to reach from where he stands the remaining money and handcuffed to a corpse, the movie ends with a coda lamenting what men would do for a lust of gold. Zerkow and Maria The young woman who sold Trina the lottery ticket, Maria Miranda Macapa ([[Dale Fuller  lives with Zerkow , who collects and sells junk. Maria often talks about her solid gold dining set. Maria lives at Zerkow\'s small home and she and Zerkow talk about nothing but the solid gold dining set. Maria claims alternately to have never mentioned it to him, only having mentioned it once, mentioning that it was just a story, and claiming to have no knowledge of the dining set either before or after it was either lost or misplaced. Zerkow doesn\'t believe her, and becomes obsessed with wheedling the truth of the set\'s location from her. She continuously denies the information to him; the culmination of their arguments resulting in him murdering her. Grannis and Miss Baker In the apartment complex where Trina and McTeague first live together, two elderly borders, Charles W. Grannis ([[Frank Hayes  and Miss Anastasia Baker  share adjoining rooms. Grannis and Miss Baker stand alone in the film because all of the other major characters are grotesques, whose ugly outward appearance reflects their inner character. Grannis is a kind man who buys back the McTeague\'s wedding picture when Trina accidentally sells it in an auction of their possessions, and Miss Baker is a sweet retired dressmaker. They live in exceptionally close quarters as the divide between their rooms is extremely thin. Throughout their stay at the complex, they have never actually met. But, they both sit close to the wall and listen to the other party for company, so it is as if they know every thing about one another. In time, they do meet, and cannot hide their long-felt feelings for each other. Eventually, they marry, and a door connects the wall between Grannis\' and Miss Baker\'s rooms; finally, the lasting love of Grannis and Miss Baker is played out in a two-strip Technicolor sequence, shown only in stills.'] ['The plot involves a young socialite pretending to be a cook, who falls in love with a man she thinks is a hired hand, but he is actually a millionaire.

Shortly after his arrival at college he becomes absorbed in the mysteries of life and death to the extent of forgetting practically everything else. His great ambition is to create a human being, and finally one night his dream is realized. He is convinced that he has found a way to create a most perfect human being that the world has ever seen. We see his experiment commence and the development of it in a vat of chemicals from a skeletal being. To Frankenstein's horror, instead of creating a marvel of physical beauty and grace, there is unfolded before his eyes and before the audience an awful, ghastly, abhorrent monster. As he realizes what he has done Frankenstein rushes from the room as the monster moves through the doors Frankenstein has placed before the vat. The misshapen monster peers at Frankenstein through the curtains of his bed. He falls fainting to the floor, where he is found by his servant, who revives him.  After a few weeks' illness, he returns home, a broken, weary man, but under the loving care of father and sweetheart he regains his health and strength and begins to take a less morbid view of life. The film's story emphasizes that the creation of the monster was possible only because Frankenstein had allowed his normal mind to be overcome by evil and unnatural thoughts. His marriage is soon to take place. But one evening, while sitting in his library, he chances to glance in the mirror before him and sees the reflection of the monster which has just opened the door of his room. All the terror of the past comes over him and, fearing lest his sweetheart should learn the truth, he bids the monster conceal himself behind the curtain while he hurriedly induces his sweetheart, who then comes in, to stay only a moment. The monster, who is following his creator with the devotion of a dog, is insanely jealous of anyone else. He snatches from Frankenstein's coat the rose which his sweetheart has given him, and in the struggle throws Frankenstein to the floor, here the monster looks up and for the first time confronts his own reflection in the mirror. Appalled and horrified at his own image he flees in terror from the room. Not being able, however to live apart from his creator, he again comes to the house on the wedding night and, searching for the cause of his jealousy, goes into the bride's room. Frankenstein coming into the main room hears a shriek of terror, which is followed a moment after by his bride rushing in and falling in a faint at his feet. The monster then enters and after overpowering Frankenstein's feeble efforts by a slight exercise of his gigantic strength leaves the house.  When Frankenstein's love for his bride shall have attained full strength and freedom from impurity it will have such an effect upon his mind that the monster cannot exist. The monster, broken down by his unsuccessful attempts to be with his creator, enters the room, stands before a large mirror and holds out his arms entreatingly. Gradually, the real monster fades away, leaving only the image in the mirror. A moment later Frankenstein himself enters. As he stands directly before the mirror he sees the image of the monster reflected instead of his own. Gradually, however, under the effect of love and his better nature, the monster's image fades and Frankenstein sees himself in his young manhood in the mirror. His bride joins him, and the film ends with their embrace, Frankenstein's mind now being relieved of the awful horror and weight it has been laboring under for so long."] ['Lord Greystoke  returns to Africa, with Lady Jane and friend Albert Werper, in order to return to Opar.

While idling away his leisure time in a pleasure garden, Freder encounters a young woman named Maria  who has brought a group of workerâs children to see the privileged lifestyle led by the rich. Maria and the children are quickly ushered away, but Freder is fascinated by Maria and descends to the workerâs city in an attempt to find her. Freder finds the workerâs city and watches in horror as a huge machine explodes, injuring many. Appalled by what he has witnessed, Freder runs to tell his father. Joh is angered that he learned of the explosion from Freder rather than his assistant Josaphat , and fires Josaphat as a result. When Freder berates his father for this, Joh is unsympathetic to Josephat or the Workers. Josaphat attempts to commit suicide over his dismissal, but is stopped by Freder. Freder tells Josaphat to return to his apartment and wait for him there, leaving to return to the workers' city. Concerned by his sonâs behaviour, Joh sends The Thin Man  to keep track of his movements. In the workerâs city, Freder sees a worker named Georgy  close to collapsing at his post. Freder relieves him, swapping clothes with Georgy and telling him to go to Josaphatâs apartment and wait for him there.

Back in the workerâs city, Freder finds a plan folded tightly in his pocket and is told of an approaching meeting by a passerby. Meanwhile, Joh has learned of mysterious plans being shared amongst the workers. He takes the plans to Rotwang , a scientist and old collaborator who informs him the plans show the underground tunnels that lie beneath the workerâs city. Rotwang was in love with Johâs deceased wife Hel, and â to Johâs horror â reveals that he has been building a robot in order to âresurrectâ her.

Josaphat tells Freder that Georgy has not arrived. Freder tells Josaphat of his experiences in the workerâs city, before departing to meet Maria.

When Freder recovers ten days later, he finds out from Josaphat that the Robot, whom they believe is Maria, is raising havoc.

Freder calls the robot out, knowing that Maria would never preach war, but is recognized as Joh Frederson's son and is attacked by the mob. In the chaos, Georgy is stabbed trying to protect Freder. Joh has ordered that the workers are allowed to rampage, in order to justify the use of heavy force against them at a later stage. The robot leads the workers from the city, who unknowingly leave their children behind, and they surge into the machine halls, abandoning their posts and destroying the Heart Machine, the central power Station of the city, which causes all the city's systems to fail. With no power for the pumps, the subterranean workers' city begins to flood.

Much of the scenario describes scenes that were rejected during initial editing, and do not appear in any known version of the film. The following plot includes only those scenes that are known to have been included in some version of the film. Not every scene described below can be viewed today.Brownlow 1983, p. 264   In the winter of 1779â1780, ten-year-old Napoleon Buonaparte  is enrolled at Brienne College, a military school for sons of nobility, run by the religious Minim Fathers in Brienne-le-ChÃ¢teau, France. The boys at the school are holding a snowball fight organised as a battlefield. Two bulliesâPhilippeaux  and Peccaduc âschoolyard antagonists of Napoleon, are leading the larger side, outnumbering the side that Napoleon fights for. These two sneak up on Napoleon with snowballs enclosing stones. A hardened snowball draws blood on Napoleon\'s face. Napoleon is warned of another rock-snowball by a shout from Tristan Fleuri , the school\'s scullion and a friend to Napoleon. Napoleon recovers himself and dashes alone to the enemy snowbank to engage the two bullies in close combat. The Minim Fathers, watching the snowball fight from windows and doorways, applaud the action. Napoleon returns to his troops and encourages them to attack ferociously. He watches keenly and calmly as this attack progresses, assessing the balance of the struggle and giving appropriate orders. He smiles as his troops turn the tide of battle. Carrying his side\'s flag, he leads his forces in a final charge and raises the flag at the enemy stronghold. The monks come out of the school buildings to discover who led the victory. A young military instructor, Jean-Charles Pichegru , asks Napoleon for his name. Napoleon responds "Nap-eye-ony" in Corsican-accented French, and is laughed at by the others. Pichegru tells him that he will go far. In class, the boys study geography. Napoleon is angered by the condescending textbook description of Corsica. He is taunted by the other boys, and kicked by the two bullies who hold flanking seats. Another of the class\'s island examples is Saint Helena, which puts Napoleon into a pensive daydream. Unhappy in school, Napoleon writes about his difficulties in a letter to his family. A bully reports to a monk that Napoleon is hiding letters in his bed, and the monk tears the letter to pieces. Angry, Napoleon goes to visit the attic quarters of his friend Fleuri, a place of refuge where Napoleon keeps his captive bird, a young eagle that was sent to him from Corsica by an uncle. Napoleon tenderly pets the eagle\'s head, then leaves to fetch water for the bird. The two bullies take this opportunity to set the bird free. Napoleon finds the bird gone and runs to the dormitory to demand the culprit show himself. None of the boys admits to the deed. Napoleon exclaims that they are all guilty, and begins to fight them all, jumping from bed to bed. In the clash, pillows are split and feathers fly through the air as the Minim Fathers work to restore order. They collar Napoleon and throw him outside in the snow. Napoleon cries to himself on the limber of a cannon, then he looks up to see the young eagle in a tree. He calls to the eagle which flies down to the cannon barrel. Napoleon caresses the eagle and smiles through his tears.  In 1792, the great hall of the Club of the Cordeliers is filled with revolutionary zeal as hundreds of members wait for a meeting to begin. The leaders of the group, Georges Danton , Jean-Paul Marat  and Maximilien Robespierre , are seen conferring. Camille Desmoulins , Danton\'s secretary, interrupts Danton to tell of a new song that has been printed, called "La Marseillaise". A young army captain, Claude Joseph Rouget de Lisle  has written the words and brought the song to the club. Danton directs de Lisle to sing the song to the club. The sheet music is distributed and the club learns to sing the song, rising in fervor with each passage. At the edge of the crowd, Napoleon , now a young army lieutenant, thanks de Lisle as he leaves: "Your hymn will save many a cannon." Splashed with water in a narrow Paris street, Napoleon is noticed by JosÃ©phine de Beauharnais  and Paul Barras  as they step from a carriage on their way into the house of Mademoiselle Lenormand , the fortune teller. Inside, Lenormand exclaims to JosÃ©phine that she has the amazing fortune to be the future queen. On the night of 10 August 1792, Napoleon watches impassively as mob rule takes over Paris and a man is hung by revolutionaries. In front of the National Assembly, Danton tells the crowd that they have cracked the monarchy. Napoleon senses a purpose rising within him, to bring order to the chaos. The mob violence has tempered his character. Napoleon, on leave from the French Army, travels to Corsica with his sister, Ãlisa . They are greeted by his mother, Letizia Buonaparte  and the rest of his family at their summer home in Les Milelli. The shepherd Santo-Ricci  interrupts the happy welcome to tell Napoleon the bad news that Corsica\'s president, Pasquale Paoli  is planning to give the island to the British. Napoleon declares his intention to prevent this fate. Riding a horse and revisiting places of his childhood, Napoleon stops in Milelli gardens and considers whether to retreat and protect his family, or to advance into the political arena. Later in the streets of Ajaccio, Pozzo di Borgo  encourages a mob to put Napoleon to death for opposing Paoli, and the townsfolk surround the Buonaparte home. Napoleon stands outside the door and stares the crowd down, dispersing them silently. Paoli signs a death warrant, putting a price on Napoleon\'s head. Napoleon\'s brothers, Lucien  and Joseph , leave for Calvi to see if French authorities can intervene. Napoleon faces the danger alone, walking into an inn where men are arguing politics, all of whom would like to see him dead. He confronts the men and says, "Our fatherland is France&nbsp;...with me!" His arguments subdue the crowd, but di Borgo enters the inn, accompanied by gendarmes. Napoleon evades capture and rides away on his horse, pursued by di Borgo and his men. Upstairs in the Ajaccio town hall, a council declares war on France even while the French flag flies outside the window. Napoleon climbs up the balcony and takes down the flag, shouting to the council, "It is too great for you!" The men fire their pistols at Napoleon but miss as he rides away. While chasing Napoleon, di Borgo stretches a rope across a road that Napoleon is likely to take. As expected, Napoleon rides toward the rope, but he draws his saber and cuts it down. Napoleon continues at high speed to the shore where he finds a small boat. He abandons the horse and gets into the boat, discovering that it has no oars or sail. He unfurls the French flag from Ajaccio and uses it as a sail. He is drawn out into the open sea. Meanwhile in Paris, meeting in the National Assembly, the majority Girondists are losing to the Montagnards: Robespierre, Danton, Marat and their followers. Robespierre calls for all Girondists to be indicted.  The Girondists seek to flee but are repulsed.  The assembly hall rolls with the struggle between Girondists and Montagnards.  Later, in calm water, the small boat is seen by Lucien and Joseph Buonaparte aboard a French ship, Le Hasard. The larger ship is steered to rescue the unknown boat, and as it is pulled close, Napoleon is recognised, lying unconscious at the bottom, gripping the French flag. Waking, Napoleon directs the ship to a cove in Corsica where the Buonaparte family is rescued. The ship sails for France carrying a future queen, three future kings, and the future Emperor of France. A British warship, the HMS Agamemnon, sights Le Hasard, and a young officer, Horatio Nelson , asks his captain if he might be allowed to shoot at the enemy vessel and sink it. The captain denies the request, saying that the target is too unimportant to waste powder and shot. As Le Hasard sails away, an eagle flies to the Buonapartes and lands on the ship\'s flag pole.   In July 1793, fanatic Girondist Charlotte Corday  visits Marat in his home and kills him with a knife. Two months later, General Jean FranÃ§ois Carteaux , in control of a French army, is ineffectively besieging the port of Toulon, held by 20,000 English, Spanish and Italian troops. Captain Napoleon is assigned to the artillery section and is dismayed by the obvious lack of French discipline. He confronts Carteaux in an inn run by Tristan Fleuri, formerly the scullion of Brienne. Napoleon advises Carteaux how best to engage the artillery against Toulon, but Carteaux is dismissive. An enemy artillery shot hits the inn and scatters the officers. Napoleon stays to study a map of Toulon while Fleuri\'s young son Marcellin  mimes with Napoleon\'s hat and sword. Fleuri\'s beautiful daughter Violine Fleuri ([[Annabella  admires Napoleon silently. General Jacques FranÃ§ois Dugommier  replaces Carteaux and asks Napoleon to join in war planning. Later, Napoleon sees a cannon being removed from a fortification and demands that it be returned. He fires a shot at the enemy, and establishes the position as the "Battery of Men Without Fear". French soldiers rally around Napoleon with heightened spirits. Dugommier advances Napoleon to the position of commander-in-chief of the artillery. French troops under Napoleon prepare for a midnight attack. Veteran soldier Moustache  tells 7-year-old Marcellin, now a drummer boy, that the heroic drummer boy Joseph Agricol Viala was 13 when he was killed in battle. Marcellin takes courage; he expects to have six years of life left. Napoleon orders the attack forward amidst rain and high wind. A reversal causes Antoine Christophe Saliceti  to name Napoleon\'s strategy a great crime. Consequently, Dugommier orders Napoleon to cease attacking, but Napoleon discusses the matter with Dugommier and the attack is carried forward successfully despite Saliceti\'s warnings. English cannon positions are taken in bloody hand-to-hand combat, lit by lightning flashes and whipped by rain. Because of the French advance, English Admiral Samuel Hood  orders the burning of the moored French fleet before French troops can recapture the ships. The next morning, Dugommier, seeking to promote Napoleon to the rank of brigadier general, finds him asleep, exhausted. An eagle beats its wings as it perches on a tree next to Napoleon.  After being shamed in Toulon, Saliceti wants to put Napoleon on trial. Robespierre says he should be offered the command of Paris, but if he refuses he will be tried. Robespierre, supported by Georges Couthon  and Louis Antoine de Saint-Just , condemns Danton to death. Saint-Just puts JosÃ©phine into prison at Les Carmes where she is comforted by General Lazare Hoche . Fleuri, now a jailer, calls for "De Beauharnais" to be executed, and JosÃ©phine\'s ex-husband, Alexandre de Beauharnais  rises to accept his fate. Elsewhere, Napoleon is also imprisoned for refusing to serve under Robespierre. He works out the possibility of building a canal to Suez as Saliceti taunts him for not trying to form a legal defense. In an archive room filled with the files of condemned prisoners, clerks Bonnet  and La BussiÃ¨re  work secretly with Fleuri to destroy  some of the dossiers including those for Napoleon and JosÃ©phine. Meanwhile, at the National Assembly, Violine with her little brother Marcellin, watches from the gallery. Voices are raised against Robespierre and Saint-Just. Jean-Lambert Tallien  threatens Robespierre with a knife. Violine decides not to shoot Saint-Just with a pistol she brought. Back at the archives, the prison clerks are given new dossiers on those to be executed by guillotine: Robespierre, Saint-Just and Couthon. JosÃ©phine and Napoleon are released from their separate prisons. Napoleon declines the request by General Aubry to command infantry in the War in the VendÃ©e under General Hoche, saying he would not fight Frenchman against Frenchman when 200,000 foreigners were threatening the country. He is given a minor map-making command as punishment for refusing the greater post. He draws up plans for an invasion of Italy. In Nice, General SchÃ©rer  sees the plans and laughs at the foolhardy proposal. The plans are sent back, and Napoleon pastes them up to cover a broken window in the poor apartment he shares with Captain Marmont , Sergeant Junot  and the actor Talma . Napoleon and Junot see the contrast of cold, starving people outside of wealthy houses. JosÃ©phine convinces Barras to suggest to the National Assembly that Napoleon is the best man to quell a royalist uprising. On 3 October 1795 Napoleon accepts, and supplies 800 guns for defense. Directed by Napoleon, Major Joachim Murat  seizes a number of cannon to fight the royalists. Di Borgo shoots at Napoleon but misses; di Borgo is then wounded by Fleuri\'s accidental musket discharge. Saliceti is prevented from escaping in disguise. Napoleon sets Saliceti and di Borgo free. Joseph FouchÃ©  tells JosÃ©phine that the noise of the fighting is Napoleon "entering history again". Napoleon is made General in Chief of the Army of the Interior to great celebration. A Victim\'s Ball is held at Les Carmes, formerly the prison where JosÃ©phine was held. To amuse the attendees, Fleuri re-enacts the tragedy of the executioner\'s roll-call. The beauty of JosÃ©phine is admired by ThÃ©rÃ©sa Tallien  and Madame Juliette RÃ©camier , and Napoleon is also fascinated. He plays chess with Hoche, beating him as JosÃ©phine watches and entices Napoleon with her charms. The dancers at the ball become uninhibited; the young women begin to dance partially nude.  In his army office, Napoleon tells 14-year-old EugÃ¨ne de Beauharnais  that he can keep his executed father\'s sword. The next day, JosÃ©phine arrives with EugÃ¨ne to thank Napoleon for this kindness to her only son. The general staff officers wait for hours while Napoleon clumsily tries to convey his feelings for JosÃ©phine. Later, Napoleon practises his amorous style under the guidance of his old friend Talma, the actor. Napoleon visits JosÃ©phine daily. Violine is greatly hurt to see Napoleon\'s attentions directed away from herself. In trade for agreeing to marry Napoleon, JosÃ©phine demands of Barras that he place Napoleon in charge of the French Army of Italy. Playing with JosÃ©phine\'s children, Napoleon narrowly misses seeing Barras in her home. JosÃ©phine hires Violine as a servant. Napoleon plans to invade Italy. He wishes to marry JosÃ©phine as quickly as possible before he leaves. Hurried preparations go forward. However, on the wedding day, 9 March 1796, Napoleon is two hours late. He is found in his room planning the Italian campaign, and the wedding ceremony is rushed. That night, Violine and JosÃ©phine both prepare for the wedding bed. Violine prays to a shrine of Napoleon. JosÃ©phine and Napoleon embrace at the bed. In the next room, Violine kisses a shadowy figure of Napoleon that she has created from a doll. Just before leaving Paris, Napoleon enters the empty National Assembly hall at night, and sees the spirits of those who had set the Revolution in motion. The ghostly figures of Danton and Saint-Just speak to Napoleon, and demand answers from him regarding his plan for France. All the spirits sing "La Marseillaise". Only 48 hours after his wedding, Napoleon leaves Paris in a coach for Nice. He writes dispatches, and letters to JosÃ©phine. Back in Paris, JosÃ©phine and Violine pray at the little shrine to Napoleon. Napoleon speeds to Albenga on horseback to find the army officers resentful and the soldiers starving. He orders a review of the troops. The troops respond quickly to the commanding presence of Napoleon and bring themselves to perfect attention. Fleuri, now a soldier, tries and fails to get a hint of recognition from Napoleon. The Army of Italy is newly filled with fighting spirit. Napoleon encourages them for the coming campaign into Italy, the "honour, glory and riches" which will be theirs upon victory. The underfed and poorly armed force advances into Montenotte and takes the town. Further advances carry Napoleon to Montezemolo. As he gazes upon the Alps, visions appear to him of future armies, future battles, and the face of JosÃ©phine. The French troops move forward triumphantly as the vision of an eagle fills their path, a vision of the red, white and blue French flag waving before them.'] ["A foreigner, Von Haeke, seduces a mine-owner's daughter in order to gain access to her house and her father's money.

The film starts with the Lenin quotation "Even now there are far reaches of the Soviet Union where the patriarchal way of life persists along with remnants of the clan system." Svanetia and the mountain village of Ushguli are then located on two slowly dissolving maps of the region and are described as "cut off from civilization by mountains and glaciers". The location of the village is further introduced by several expository shots showing the Svanetian landscape. The film then concentrates on the daily routine of the villagers. One sequence shows how sheep are raised, and how wool and yarn are produced. Another scene shows a suspension bridge and a man trying to cross it. A harvest during an early snowstorm is shown. Other scenes show how the Svan people tailor their clothes, make hats, cut their hair and bury their dead. The film then concentrates on the lack of salt supplies. Cut off from the outside world for most of the year, the village suffers from a shortage of salt. It is shown how this forces the animals to lick human sweat and urine. The solution to the salt shortage is presented in the climax of the film where the young Soviet power builds a road that connects the isolated region to the outside world. The film shows how teams of construction workers with their steamrollers arrive, cutting down a forest that is the last obstacle for the road that will connect the Svan people with Soviet civilisation.'] ["The film focuses on a man who visits a mystical, organic building that looks like a medieval cathedral.

Wandering into a mosque, he tells the holy man ([[Charles Belcher  he disdains his religion; his philosophy is, "What I want, I take." That night, he sneaks into the palace of the caliph  using a magic rope he stole during ritual prayers. All thoughts of plunder are forgotten when he sees the sleeping princess , the caliph\'s daughter. The princess\'s Mongol slave  discovers him and alerts the guards, but he gets away. When his associate  reminds the disconsolate Ahmed that a bygone thief once stole another princess during the reign of Haroun al-Rashid, Ahmed sets out to do the same.

The three princes meet as agreed at a caravansary before returning to Bagdad. The Mongol asks the Indian to check whether the princess has waited for them. They discover that she is near death, and ride the flying carpet to reach her. Then the Mongol uses the apple to cure her. The suitors argue over which gift is rarest, but the princess points out that without any one gift, the remaining two would have been useless in saving her life. Her loyal slave shows her Ahmed in the crystal ball, so the princess convinces her father to deliberate carefully on his future son-in-law. The Mongol prince chooses not to wait, unleashing his secret army that night and capturing Bagdad. Ahmed arrives at the city gate, shut and manned by Mongols.

The silent film adds considerably to the material in Watkins' play, some additions based on the original murder, and some to Hollywood considerations. The murder, which occurs in a very brief vignette before the play begins, is fleshed out considerably. Also, Roxie's husband Amos Hart  has a much more sympathetic and active role in the film than he does either in the play or in the subsequent musical. The ending is more cruel to Roxie, in keeping with Hollywood values of not allowing criminals to profit too much from their crimes . The film was long difficult to see, but a recent print was made available from the UCLA Film and Television Archive, enabling the film to play at festivals and historic theaters around the country. This has greatly improved the reputation of the film.Chicago at silentera.com database Also a print of the film survives at Gosfilmofond Russian State Archives."] ["Margaret Selfridge  lives with her affluent father, Simon  and her Aunt Abigail  in a mansion in New York City.

Along the way, he befriends another unnamed immigrant  who is traveling to America with her ailing mother. The two are robbed by a pickpocket who is losing in gambling. The Tramp, feeling sorry for the two penniless women, attempts to secretly place his winnings from his card game in the woman's pocket, but ends up being mistakenly accused of being a pickpocket. The woman manages to clear the Tramp's name. Upon arrival in America, the Tramp and the woman part company.

Terrified of facing the same treatment as the man he saw thrown out, the Tramp begins planning how he will fight the huge man. Soon, however, he finds the same coin fallen from the head waiter's pocket onto the floor and makes many failed attempts to retrieve it without notice. He finally retrieves the coin and nonchalantly pays the waiter only to be thunderstruck when the waiter reveals the coin to be fake. Once again, the Tramp prepares for the fight of his life. Just then, a visiting artist spots the Tramp and the woman and offers them a job to pose for a painting. The two agree. The artist offers to pay for the Tramp and the woman's meal, but the Tramp declines the offer several times for reasons of etiquette, intending to eventually accept the artist's offer; however, he's dismayed when the artist does not renew his offer to pay at the last moment. The artist pays for his own meal and leaves a tip for the waiter. The Tramp notices that the tip is enough to cover the couple's meal and, without the artist noticing, palms the tip and presents it to the waiter as his own payment for his and the woman's meal. As a final riposte, he lets the waiter keep the remaining change - one small coin - after paying his bill. The waiter thinks the artist himself has given no tip whatsoever, and is clearly upset at this supposed action.

Philipe calls the police just as MorÃ©no enters and finds his safe opened from the other side. He walks through, being caught by Philipe. MorÃ©no is revealed to be another criminal in disguise, and claims not to have killed Metadier, but to have found his body by the train tracks where the Vampires had dumped it and put it in his safe, assuming his identity and taking the money, which is now in the Vampires\' possession. The police arrive and arrest MorÃ©no.   The examining magistrate from Saint-Clement-Sur-Cher relocates to Paris and is assigned to the Vampire case and the MorÃ©no affair.

While writing an account of the events, Philipe is pulled out of his window by the Vampires and whisked into a large box. He is driven away but is taken off and slides down a large flight of stairs. The Vampires retreat and Philipe is let out by two bystanders. He visits the costume designer whose name is on the box, at the same time as MorÃ©no and his gang who are buying police uniforms for a scheme. Philipe learns that the box was to go to Baron de Mortesalgues on Maillot Avenue. Later, MorÃ©no confronts Philipe in a cafÃ©, but when he calls for the nearby policemen, they turn out to be part of MorÃ©noâs gang and he is again captured. Meanwhile, Mazamette breaks into MorÃ©noâs hideout. Philipe is taken there to be hanged by the gang, unless he can give them means to revenge themselves against the Vampires. He tells them that Baron de Mortesalgues is the Grand Vampire, and they spare him, tying him up. Mazamette appears and frees him. That evening, the Grand Vampire holds a party, in disguise as Baron de Mortesalgues, for his niece, Irma in disguise, which attracts many members of the Parisian aristocracy. He reveals that at midnight there will be a surprise, the surprise being a gas attack on the guests. The Vampires steal all of their valuables while they are unconscious. They flee with the stolen items on the top of their car, but MorÃ©no, forewarned by Philipe, takes them for himself. Mazamette visits Philipe, angry with their lack of progress and tries to quit. Philipe shows him a line from a book of Jean de la Fontaineâs Fables which states âin all things, one must take the end into account.â   Fifteen days have passed since the events at Maillot. MorÃ©no, who has established a gaze with a terrible hypnotic power, is looking for clues to lead him to the Vampires, and reads in a paper that a Fontainebleau notary has been murdered by them. Meanwhile, Philipe and Mazamette go to see a film, which mysteriously contains Irma Vep and the Grand Vampire. While cycling to Fontainebleau, they spot an American tourist, Horatio Werner, riding into the forest, and follow him. He places a box under one of the boulders, and they take it. The Grand Vampire, who is staying in the Royal Hunt Hotel under the pseudonym of Count Kerlor, along with Irma in disguise as his son, Viscount Guy, reads in a paper that George Baldwin , an American millionaire, has been robbed of $200,000 and who ever can capture the criminal, Raphael Norton, will be awarded the money. He notices that Mr and Mrs. Werner, who are staying at the hotel, are distressed by this, and concludes that Mr. Werner is Raphael Norton. Philipe and Mazamette arrive at the hotel and find that the Vampires are based there. In a different hotel they force open the box and find Baldwinâs stolen money inside. MorÃ©no comes to the Royal Hunt in disguise. While the Grand Vampire tells the hotel guests a story, Irma breaks into the Wernerâs suite, finding a map leading to the box in the forest. When she leaves, she is strangled and hypnotised by MorÃ©no, who takes the map. While his gang take Irma away, he dresses his hypnotised maid, Laura, as Irma and tells her to give the Vampires the map. Once one of the Vampires  follows the map to get the treasure, MorÃ©noâs gang ambushes her, only to find that Philipe has already taken it. In the early morning, the police raid the hotel and find that Werner is actually Norton, so Philipe and Mazamette win the money. MorÃ©no is shown to have fallen in love with Irma and no longer intends to hold her ransom to the Grand Vampire. The Grand Vampire comes to meet MorÃ©no, but MorÃ©no convinces Irma to kill him.   A mysterious man  arrives at MorÃ©noâs home, and shows that he knows that the Grand Vampireâs body is inside a trunk. MorÃ©no tries to get rid of him, but he is paralysed by a pin in the manâs glove. The man reveals himself to be the true Grand Vampire, Satanus, and that the first was a subordinate. While at a cabaret called the "Happy Shack", MorÃ©no and Irma receive a note from Satanus saying they will see proof of his power at two o\'clock. At two he fires a powerful canon at the "Happy Shack", largely destroying it. Meanwhile, Philipe decides to visit Mazamette, but he is out "chasing the girls." He hides as Mazamette arrives home, drunk, with two women and a friend, who he later chases out angrily at gunpoint. The next morning, Irma and MorÃ©no go to Satanusâ home to surrender, and Satanus offers them the chance to work with him, showing them that George Baldwin is stopping at the park hotel. One of MorÃ©noâs accomplices, Lily Flower , goes to the Park Hotel and poses as an interviewer from "Modern Woman" magazine and gets his autograph. Afterwards, Irma enters and records his voice saying "Parisian women are the most charming I\'ve seen, all right!" Back at MorÃ©noâs home, they write out an order to pay Lily Flower $100,000, ending it with Baldwinâs autograph. When the banker calls Baldwin to confirm the cheque, Irma intercepts the call, disguised as a telephone operator, and plays the recording she made instead. While Lily Flower is taking the money, Mazamette comes in, recognising her as a squeeze from the "Happy Shack", and follows her, seeing her give MorÃ©no the money in a taxi. MorÃ©no gives Satanus the money, but he is given it back as a present. Philipe and Mazamette capture Lily Flower at her home and tell her to call MorÃ©no and tell him to come, but when he and Irma arrive they fall into a trap and are caught by the police.   Irma, sentenced to life imprisonment, has been sent to St. Lazarusâ prison. A transfer order is sent to the prison to send Irma to a penal colony in Algeria. On the day of her departure, Irma finds out that MorÃ©no has been executed. Satanus follows Irmaâs transportation route, stopping at a seaside hotel in disguise as a Priest. At the port, he gives some religious comfort to the prisoners, but Irmaâs copy contains a secret message saying âthe ship will blow up.â Satanus destroys the ship with a canon in an unfathomable explosion. Meanwhile, Philipe finds through the red codebook that the explosive shell that landed on the âHappy Shackâ, and also now the boat came from Montmartre, and Mazamette goes to find it. His son, Eustache Mazamette , is returned home from school due to bad behaviour, so they go to look for it together. They find some men loading boxes into a house, and notice one of the top hat cases contains a shell. Later, reading that no survivors have been found from the exploding ship, Satanus visits Philipe to avenge Irmaâs death. He paralyses him with a poisoned pin in his glove and leaves a bomb in a top hat to kill him off. Mazamette arrives and throws the top hat out the window just in time. At Satanusâ home, Eustache is used as a ploy to hide Mazamette in a box, but Satanus sees this through a spy-hole. Simultaneously Eustache shoots at Satanus as the police raid the building and arrest him. After the action, they find that Mazametteâs nose has been broken by Eustacheâs fire. Meanwhile, Irma is shown to have survived the blast on the ship, trying to get back to Paris from under a train. She is helped by the station staff and police, faking that she is in âone of those eternal love stories beloved by popular imagination.â She makes her way to the Vampire hangout, the âHowling Catâ nightclub, where she performs, and is rapturously greeted by the Vampires. Upon hearing of the arrest of Satanus, one of the Vampires, Venomous , appoints himself the new chief. By Satanusâ orders, they mail him an envelope containing a poisoned note, which he uses to commit suicide.   Irma is now a devoted collaborator of Venomous, who is set on getting rid of Philipe and Mazamette. He learns that Philipe is engaged to Jane Bremontier , and the following day Irma and Lily Flower rent an apartment above hers. Irmaâs maid, a Vampire also, hears that Philipe and Janeâs engagement party will be catered for by the famous BÃ©chamel House. Venomous cancels their catering order, and on the day of the party the Vampires appear instead. Janeâs mother  gives the servants some champagne as a present, but just as dinner is served one of the concierge, Leon Charlet, is poisoned and killed from drinking it. The landlady stops the party guests from drinking their champagne just in time, and the Vampires make a hasty escape. A few days later, Mazamette and Philipeâs mother pick up Jane and her mother while travelling to a safe retreat near Fontainebleau in the night. Irma, who tries to fill the car with poisonous gas, is spotted by Mazamette, but he is gassed and taken away while she hides in a box on the car. Mazamette is taken to the police station, believed to be drunk, and calls Philipe to warn him, but Irma slips out of the box and gets away in the car before Philipe can catch her. He goes to meet up with Mazamette at the Pyramid Hotel, but spots Irma there and ties her up. While he and Mazamette attempt to ambush Venomous, he saves Irma and drives off in Mazametteâs car, so they chase him in his. Philipe chases Venomous on foot, following him onto the top of a moving train, but he gets away. Mazamette, enraged at the police for not letting him help Philipe on the train, hits one of the officers, who tries to book him, but Philipe persuades them not to.   A few months after their engagement party, and little news of the Vampires, Philipe and Jane are now married. Augustine Charlet , widow of the poisoned concierge, is invited by the GuÃ©randes to be their chamber maid, which she accepts. The following day, she receives a letter from the Vampires detailing that she should consult Madame dâAlba at 13 Avenue Junot. When she does, Mazamette, who has taken an attraction to her, follows her.

None of the characters have been given names and are therefore referred to only by description. The film opens with a middle-aged man lying on his couch with a look of discontent as his wife finishes cooking their dinner on a rather uneventful night. As she rushes back and forth setting the table, he sluggishly rises and walks across the room to the window and gazes out onto the busy streets. His wife eventually walks over and gazes too, but quickly sits at the table and begins to eat dinner. The man takes one look at the food and then casually leaves the apartment and begins to wander the streets in search of something exciting.

They all end up at a party and are seen eating at a table all together. The middle-aged man looks at his wedding ring, and inside of it he sees an image of his wife walking backwards away from him. He begins to miss her and his regular life. Around the same time, the blind man and the little boy have left the house and are standing outside a shop along the busy street. The blind man is holding the little boy\'s hand, but she is distracted by a dog and breaks his grip to chase the dog. The blind man is startled and calls out for him in a slight panic. The little boy is stranded on an island in the chaotic, bustling street, surrounded by horses, bicycles, pedestrians, and cars. A police officer stops traffic and walks the little boy across the street into the police office. Meanwhile, the blind man is sliding along a wall, looking desperately for the little boy. He mistakenly steps too far into the street and falls down onto the sidewalk after being nearly run over by a car. He pants heavily, upset and disoriented. A passing pedestrian stops and helps the blind man up and offers to help him get home. The police take the little boy home and put him to bed.

He tells her about how the Land of Oz was ruled by Prime Minister Kruel , after the baby princess of Oz was mysteriously snatched away from her crib. Kruel's despotic rule is aided by the manipulative Ambassador Wikked , who is the originator of many of Kruel's ideas; the aide Lady Vishuss ; and the Wizard ([[Charles Murray , who knows only parlor tricks and not any actual magic, such as getting a female impersonator  out of a basket in an exotic and seductive way. The people have begun to revolt and their leader, Prince Kynd , demands the return of the princess so she can be crowned. Kruel, however, knows that once she returns his rule over Oz will end, so he sends Ambassador Wikked on a mission to prevent this from happening. Meanwhile, in Kansas, Dorothy lives on a farm with her relatives. While Aunt Em  is a kind and caring woman, Uncle Henry  is a cruel, morbidly obese man who constantly yells and berates Dorothy. He also abuses his farmhands Snowball (credited to G. Howe Black, a stage name for [[Spencer Bell , Hardy, and Semon when he feels they are not doing their work. Hardy and Semon are both in love with Dorothy, who toys with them but doesn't commit to either of them, driving them both crazy with her indecision. After a particularly grueling day on the farm, Aunt Em reveals to Dorothy that they are not her birth relatives and that she was found on their doorstep with an envelope, instructing that it only be opened when she turned eighteen. When her birthday comes, however, Wikked and his minions come to the farm, demanding that the envelope be given to them unopened. It turns out that the note inside is in fact a royal decree which reveals Dorothy to be the long-lost Princess Dorothea of Oz. As long as she never reads the decree, she can't legally become the queen according to the laws of Oz. Uncle Henry refuses to hand the envelope over, and so Wikked takes Dorothy hostage, threatening to kill her, and orders the entire farm to be searched. While doing so, Wikked finds out that Hardy is in love with Dorothy, and promises wealth and her love if he gets the note to him first. Tempted by the riches given to him by Wikked, he readily agrees and manages to find the note. Before he can give it to him, he is ambushed by Semon, who takes it back and saves Dorothy. As Hardy and Wikked chase Semon, a tornado suddenly forms, sucking everybody in and forcing Dorothy to take shelter in the farmhouse. It is blown towards the entrance to Oz, smashing into pieces upon hitting the ground. Semon then gives the envelope to her who promptly reads the decree; by the time Kruel and Kynd come out to intercept her, she has already finished reading it. Thwarted, Kruel and Wikked proceed to blame the farmhands for kidnapping her and order the Wizard to change them into monkeys, which he is unable to do. Semon and Hardy try to help him out by disguising themselves as the Scarecrow and the Tin Man respectively but the disguises are soon seen through and they are promptly arrested. During their trial, Hardy betrays his fellow farmhands and accuses them of kidnapping Dorothy, and Kynd sentences them to imprisonment. With Hardy now aiding him, Kruel is free to continue ruling as a dictator, using Dorothy and Kynd as his puppets. He allows Dorothy to give Hardy and Uncle Henry high positions in the army  while also plotting to keep her from knowing his schemes. He eventually decides, with Wikked's persuasion, to cement his power by marrying her, and also forces Semon and Snowball to work in his underground prisons. The Wizard helps them escape by giving Snowball a Lion costume, which he uses to scare off the guards. Though Semon manages to reach Dorothy to warn her that she was being used, he's chased back down into the dungeons by Hardy, and ends up getting trapped inside a lion cage for a considerable amount of time. He and Snowball eventually escape, and Semon gets to Dorothy's room in time to save her and Kynd from Kruel's treachery. Cornered by Semon and Kynd, he admits that he was the one who had kidnapped Dorothy as a baby and took her to Kansas, in order to keep her from court factions that meant to do her harm; it is later implied that they are led by Wikked and that he is the true antagonist of the story. After Kruel is taken away, Semon attempts to tell Dorothy how he feels about her, only to find that she has fallen in love with Prince Kynd and intends to marry him and rule Oz. Heartbroken, Semon is then chased by Wikked and Hardy's men, who attempt to blast him with cannon balls. Snowball flies a plane over and grabs him before he can be hit, but the ladder breaks, and he falls. Outside of the story, the granddaughter's Scarecrow doll falls off of a chair, implying that the Scarecrow in the story may have died from the fall. This wakes her up, and she is comforted by the toymaker and bidden to go back to sleep. He then secretly reads the last page of the book, which shows that Prince Kynd and Dorothy lived happily ever after in Oz. Given that he created dolls that were the exact likeness of several of the characters in the story, the implication is that he is actually Semon's character."] ['   Near West Coast Studios in Hollywood, the gang is are waging a street war against a rival group of kids; their ammunition primarily consisting of old vegetables.

After the family discusses Hilary\'s genetic predisposition toward psychiatric problems, which Sydney seems to have inherited, Hilary and Sydney give up Meg and Kit in order to avoid passing this trait to future generations.  The film begins on Christmas Eve as Meg gives a party in her comfortable English manor. In addition to dancing and listening to Christmas carols, Sydney and Kit happily discuss their future together, as do Meg and Gray. The only unpleasant moment of the evening occurs when the singers dedicate their performance of God Bless the Master of This House to Gray. Hilary\'s sister Hester objects to this because she considers Hilary to be the master of the house even though he is psychotic and institutionalized. On Christmas morning, while Meg and Gray are at church, the asylum telephones to say that Hilary has gone missing, and Hester unintentionally reveals to Sydney that insanity runs in their family. The family\'s official explanation of Hilary\'s troubles has been that he experienced shell shock while fighting in World War I, but another family member had similar problems in the past. Hester and Sydney discuss Hilary\'s talent as a composer, and Sydney sits down at the piano to play an unfinished sonata that Hilary wrote before going to war. A few minutes later, Hilary returns home, having escaped from the asylum. He meets Sydney and they chat comfortably, except for a heated argument that serves to further display their similarities as sensitive, free-spirited individuals. When Meg returns from church, she reacts to Hilary\'s presence with shock. She has not loved him for years, is frightened by him, and has been counting on her upcoming marriage to Gray, who helped her obtain a divorce on account of Hilary\'s insanity. However, Hilary is caught up in his own sudden recovery and assumes that she will welcome him back. He fails to understand and accept that her life with him ended long ago until his doctor arrives from the asylum and explains the situation to him, saying, "Face it, man! One of you must suffer. Which is it to be? A healthy woman with her life before her, or a man whose children ought never to have been born?" The doctor says this in Sydney\'s presence. This prompts Sydney to begin contemplating her own plans with Kit. After the doctor tells Sydney that any children she has would be at risk of inheriting Hilary\'s problems, she breaks her engagement to Kit and sends him away. Meanwhile, Hilary vacillates between accepting Meg\'s love for Gray and pleading with her to change her mind. Meg gives in to his pressure, but he spies her talking with Gray and sees how much she loves Gray and how miserable she feels. Finally, Hilary regains his will to do what is best, and he has Sydney send Meg and Gray away. When Sydney returns to Hilary, she tearfully embraces him and they agree that they will live together.

The characters all end up staying in the same hotel, where the Davidsons plot to teach the natives about sin and Sadie entertains a bunch of marines. Sadie begins to fall in love with Sergeant Timothy O'Hara , who isnât fazed by her past. He tells her that he has a best friend who married a former prostitute and the couple now lives happily in Australia. Davidson sets about trying to 'redeem' Sadie, much to her disgust. She doesn't see why she should have to answer to him above anyone else; finding himself self-important. Davidson tricks her into telling him about her past in San Francisco and, once she refuses to repent, he declares that he will go to the Governor and have her deported. Sadie is terrified of the idea but O'Hara assures her that it won't happen. He tells her he wishes she would go to Australia and wait for his term of service to finish, after which they'll marry. This they both agree upon. Davidson gets his way, however, and Sadie is livid. She and O'Hara go to plead with the Governor, begging him to let her go to Australia instead of back to San Francisco. Once we find Davidson has also managed to get O'Hara punished for being immoral, we're told that Sadie will be able to go to Australia instead, but only if Davidson okays it. Davidson refuses and Sadie pleads, but to no avail. She eventually confesses that, if she goes back to San Francisco, there is 'a man there who won't let her go straight', which is what she wants to do. Davidson figures out this means that there is a warrant for her arrest back in San Francisco. Sadie claims that she was framed and is innocent, but it won't matter since, if she ends up in San Francisco, she'll have to go to prison nonetheless. Davidson still refuses, saying she must atone for her past. Sadie pleads and pleads and eventually offers to repent. Davidson, however, says that her offer of repentance doesnât matter and that the only way to fully repent is for her to go to prison. Sadie runs to her room, crying out for Davidson.

Three days later, we're told that Sadie has been praying the entire time. She has put away her old things and has become a modest woman. O'Hara returns and finds Davidson is gone, apparently 'trying to stop the locals from dancing on the beach'. O'Hara tells Sadie that he has a fishing boat waiting to take her and her things to a ship, that will then take her to Australia, where they can marry and be free. Sadie is extremely afraid and refuses to go, saying that 'old Sadie is dead' and she must go to San Francisco and prison, to repent. She fully relies and believes in Davidson now. O'Hara does everything he can, including forcibly taking her from the room, but Davidson is waiting outside. O'Hara tries to attack him but Sadie asks him not to, so he doesnât. O'Hara, extremely upset, leaves and Sadie pleads with Davidson not to get him in trouble, for 'it was all her fault'. She has become childlike and dependent on Davidson. Later that night, Sadie is asleep and everyone else is heading to bed. Davidson can not sleep and goes out for a walk in the rain.

The movie opens with the scene of the black-garbed killer preparing to disembark from a small house. The individual places several items into a brief case, appearing among them a deck of cards, a notebook, and a copy of the children\'s novel Mr. Pig and Sonny Too â a real publication written in 1977 by the American author Lillian Hoban. The book\'s title has an obvious connection to the film\'s. The individual closes up his brief case, standing upright and turning to reveal on camera the bleeding, half-naked body of another man lying prostrate on the floor. The living man kicks aside the corpse of the dead one and continues downstairs, packing up his belongings into a black car and driving away along a deserted road. The suited driver continues through an outstretched desert with power lines lining the side of the dirt trail. His vehicle passes an outcrop of rocks with an inscription painted on its face. Although perhaps being unintelligible, it appears to read either as "ELLE" or "ELLIE". Another sign crops up immediately after, written in black, though is essentially unreadable. The film cuts to another individual, the unidentified man , masked in white bandages covering his head. He wanders through the desert until reaching a telephone poll and sitting down, cross-legged. The driver\'s car pulls up to the side of the road, and the masked figure enters on the passenger\'s side. The two drive down another path and stop at a small house. They exit the car, where it can be seen now that the driver is leading the masked figure by a rope which binds his wrists, all the while carrying his brief case. The dilapidated doorway to the house is shown to have the number "1334" laid out in small bones at the top, otherwise adorned with a dominoes, a crucifix, caution tape and various photographs of someone\'s arms being bound. As the camera zooms onto the door frame, scenes flash to the victimized masked man\'s arms being tied with gauze tape, and then finally at the bottom of the doorway a box of dominoes opens up to reveal a keyhole. Through the keyhole a pig mask can be seen sticking through a broken wall. The scene cuts again to a corridor in the house â the word "Look" is graffitied along the wall where the masked man is bound at the wrists to the ceiling. The camera spins around the room before showing the two men outside again, this time the masked victim being led by his rope to a cellar. There the victimizer empties his brief case, among his things his deck of cards, a large metal key, a wig and a book entitled Why God Permits Evil with a demonic face printed on the cover. The captor places his hand on the head of a once-more bound-to-the-ceiling victim and pulls part of the bandage-mask from his eye, exposing his darting sight and sense of fear. A collection of pliers, knives, scissors and other instruments can be seen below.'] ["Fatty Finn  is the six-year-old leader of a gang of kids in Woolloomooloo.

Firstly using a gun he finds on a path, which turns out to be a water-pistol; then standing in front of a tram, which takes a sudden turn; then he ties a rock around his neck and jumps off a low bridge into a lake, but this fails as it is only inches deep; he then picks a second bridge, but lands in a boat; and finally stands in front of a car, which stops in time, but contains the lawyer from the earlier scene. He takes Harold to Mildred and arranges their marriage. They then drive off to the mansion, with some jokes en route: the gesticulating passengers in the car in front appear to be signalling right then left, preventing overtaking; the birds in the back seat pecking his head. They reach the mansion and the uncle plays a series of tricks to make the house appear haunted. A series of people appear in white sheets and covered in flour until the prank is uncovered. In a more unusual prank a pair of trousers walk on their own, having a little black boy inside. We see Harold\'s hair stand on end then fall. The film ends with the couple asking one another what their name is and entering the bedroom together.'] ["Liz Simpkins is the daughter of town drunk John.

Baron Regnard becomes his patron, enabling him to do research while living in his mansion. One day, Beaumont announces to his beloved wife Marie and the baron that he has proved all his theories and is ready to present them before the Academy of the Sciences. He leaves the arrangements to the baron. However, after Beaumont goes to sleep, Marie steals his key, opens the safe containing his papers, and gives them to the baron. It is clear that Marie and the baron are lovers. On the appointed day, Paul travels to the Academy with the baron. He is aghast when the baron, instead of introducing him, takes credit for Paul\'s work himself. After he recovers from the shock, Paul confronts him in front of everyone, but the baron tells them that Paul is merely his assistant and slaps him. All of the academicians laugh at his humiliation. Paul later seeks comfort from his wife, but she brazenly admits she and the baron are having an affair and calls him a clown. Paul leaves them. Five years pass by. Paul is now a clown calling himself "HE who gets slapped", the star attraction of a small circus near Paris. His act consists of him getting slapped every evening by other clowns, and includes a parody of the event in the preceding paragraph. Another of the performers is Bezano, a daredevil horseback rider. Consuelo, the daughter of the impoverished Count Mancini, applies to join his act. Bezano falls in love with Consuelo, as does Paul.

The next day, Consuelo receives jewelry from the baron, but she rejects it.

The baron and count try to leave, but finding the main entrance locked, open the side door, releasing the lion. The animal kills first the count, then the baron. However, the lion tamer shows up and saves HE from the same fate. HE goes on stage and collapses. He assures Consuelo he is happy and that she will be happy, before dying in her arms.

She points to the source of her irritation off-camera, and in a funny pan over to the sofa, there\'s an empty-faced Stan sitting with a cigar in his mouth. Mrs. H is having none of her husband\'s attempts at conciliation â "He leaves! Or I leave!" â and after just a moment of hesitation from Ollie, she makes good on her threat. "Uncle Bernal won\'t leave us a dime if you go," Ollie offers, but she shows how much she cares about that by sweeping two planters off their stands and onto the floor as she pounds out the door. And thus is set off the rest of the story. First Stan and Ollie have a round of vase smashing in the living room and Stan announces that he, too, will be leaving the premises. Then the doorbell rings â and of course it is Uncle Bernal. Some astonishingly fast sweeping conceals the evidence of the recent destructive contretemps, and Ollie greets Uncle B cordially. The two settle in on the sofa and Uncle Bernal says he wants to meet the little lady. Before Ollie can say she\'s not home, Stan slams a drawer upstairs and Ollie is forced to say, "I\'ll bring her down." Upstairs, Ollie drafts Stan into playing the absent Magnolia and supervises his wardrobe transformation, then hurries back down to ride herd on inquisitive Uncle B, who has discovered telltale debris of planters and vases behind the sofa. Ollie paves the way for his "wife\'s" grand entrance by telling his uncle that "She\'s not much to look at â But what a clown." Said entrance is indeed grand â when "she" turns her ankle and bounces down the steps with legs widely akimbo. Bernal looks stunned after his first glimpse of his niece, but he smiles wanly when Ollie looks for approval. Out on the sofa, Stan tries to snare the cigar Bernal is offering Ollie, then Uncle offers dinner â and dancing â at The Pink Pup, and "won\'t take no for an answer." At the supper club, Stan proves to be as inept a wife as he was a houseguest. When Ollie slips and pulls Stan down with him, "her" flailing attempts to get up are far removed from femininity; when her dumbbell-falsies tumble out, she has trouble staying in her chair. She does draw the gaze of a nearby drunk, though, whose attentions turn increasingly amorous and culminate when he presents her with a centerpiece and the question: "Didn\'t I meet you in the fountain at Miami?" He makes himself at home at their table, tickling Stan under the chin and rubbing Uncle Bernal more and more the wrong way, until Uncle asks Ollie, "Why don\'t you do something forceful?" Ollie\'s forceful action is to turn his bowl of soup over the drunk\'s head and leave the bowl on top like a doughboy\'s tin hat. The drunk maintains his dignity: he asks for his check, and for a bowl of soup "to take out." He exits with his tuxedo soiled, his soup-bowl full, but self-esteem flying high. When Ollie commandeers Stan\'s soup to replace his own, a cutaway to Uncle Bernal suggests that he might be growing a little tired of his would-be heir. Meanwhile, a dishonest waiter has been eyeing the chunky diamond pendant dangling from a posh lady diner, and when he gets the chance, he lifts it. But the maitre d\' pledges to the woman\'s husband he\'ll have everyone in the place searched, and the culprit chooses Stan\'s back to drop the hot rock down. Stan\'s resultant wriggling further irritates Bernal, so The Boys adjourn to the dance floor to sort things out. But they do not have much luck there, and get caught behind a screen, then in a phone booth, then up on stage with Ollie\'s hands all over Stan. Watching their gyrations is too much for exasperated Uncle Bernal who stands up and announces, "I\'m through! I\'ll leave my money to a dog and cat hospital!" The Boys pursue him out the front door, but he leaves them in front of the club. Ollie is crestfallen: "I\'ve lost my wife, an\' my fortune â What next?" From outside the frame comes an arm and a bowl of soup, which gets overturned onto Ollie\'s head, leaving the bowl on top. A cut to a wider shot reveals the little drunk from inside, still wearing his bowl like a WWI helmet, while the music track plays "Over There." In the closing two-shot, The Boys have slowly-spreading smiles, and we realize what they have not lost: the friendship that will carry them through nearly fifty more short subjects and many features.'] ['As the American Civil War begins, Ned Burton leaves his Southern love, Agatha Warren, and joins the Union army.

Then, she is instructed to powder the baby, but unknowingly powders its face. Ossi is so confused about why she should powder its bottom that she exclaims, âthatâs funny.â She goes to touch the bottom but disgusted, tosses the naked doll behind her, across the room, and proceeds to throw powder puff at the instructor. We enter the small flat of Prince Nucki where he and his friend Josef, both in nice dress suits, are hand washing clothes and hanging the wet clothes around the flat to dry on lines. The matchmaker comes to meet Nucki. When he rings the bell, Nucki and Josef look at each other in a fright and begin to take off all of their rings, and other nice materials, thinking it might be their poorer friends, but when Josef sees that it is Seligson, they hurry to put on all of the rings and jewelry they just took off. Josef greets the matchmaker and tells him that he will see if the âhighnessâ will see him. âIn the meantime, take a seat on the banister,â Josef says. When he goes back in, the two of them scamper around to fix up the place to make it look decent, and start throwing things off screen. When Seligson enters, Nucki is upon a throne of an old chair and a wooden box. Seligson tells Nucki that heâs got a nice match. He tells Nucki that the light-haired Ossi has hair as black as night, to which Nucki shakes his head but who cares when the girl has that much money. Nucki decides that he needs to send his adjutant to look at her. Josef and Nucki can\'t believe that the matchmaker actually believed them. They fix Josef up in a suit and top hat. Back at the Quakers, Ossi grows impatient after a grueling hour and a half of waiting. She is all flustered so she snags Mister Quakers paper out of his hands, but he must be used to this because he simply pulls another out of his pocket. Ossi declares that if she doesnât have a husband in five minutes, sheâll demolish the house. To this, Mister Quaker welcomes her to it and hands her a vase to smash. To his invitation she breaks a mirror with the vase, but Mister Quaker calmly replies, â Iâm not Impressed.â  Josef shows up at the Quakers. Upon arrival, all of the waiters, butlers and other workers of the house standing at attention, bow to Josef and then take away his hat and cane in a hurry. One asks for his card, and after a few moments of fumbling around his borrowed coat, he gives Nuckiâs card to the butler. This is where all of the confusion starts. When she gets the card, Ossi becomes so excited to know the prince is there. Josef waits in the unusually large drawing room where you can\'t even see the ceiling. Quaker is taken to his room to sleep while Ossi is readied. This is a long process. Ossi does nothing to get herself ready, because she just has all of her maids do it for her. She is carried from room to room on a conveyor belt of women. Josef begins pacing around the room, faster and faster. Josef is startled at how quickly ten servants show up after pushing a single button. Josef is impatient, and Quaker is not impressed at all. By the time Ossi is finally ready, both Quaker and Josef are asleep. She walks in, looking quite similar to before, takes one look at Josef, and says, âGood Lord, he looks stupid!â But this doesnât stop the marriage-thirsty Ossi, and she rushes them off to be wed in a hurry. She doesnât even bother to wake her father, or introduce him to her soon to be husband. The two ride off in a carriage drawn by 10 horses. Ossi wants a quick marriage so they visit a priest at his house and have the ceremony through his window, where Josef doesnât even say a word for Ossi declares that he has nothing to say anyways. After the quick I do, they pay the priest, and rush off, back to the Quaker house. When Ossi introduces her new husband to the servants, they boil over with laughter. Josef then is sent to introduce himself to Quaker, but when he asks how to get there, all he gets is a ridiculously large sized map and a friendly, âBon Voyage!â Josef is mistaken for a butler and is ordered to blow Quakers nose. When Quaker finds out that he isnât a butler but really his son-in-law, he states, âIâm not impressed.â  On account of the hurry, the wedding celebration includes only the closest family members. Dozens upon dozens of waiters, butlers, and chefs rush around to prepare a feast for the 50 closest family members. There are lines and lines of waiters waiting to serve the guests. Josef is in heaven and is scarfing food and chugging his drinks. Mister Quaker makes a toast, âExcuse me for introducing you to my son-in-law,â to show his feelings about the new member of the family. Ossi punches Josef and tells him so ironically to not be so greedy. Josefâs toast is short, saying that he hasnât had that much to eat in a while. "A Foxtrot Epidemic Suddenly Breaks Out During The Wedding" There is a gigantic band and a wide dance floor in one room where the Foxtrotters enter and dance around. The band has an animated bandmaster who likes to move around, and shake his stuff. As everyone dances, Ossi dances alone. Quaker tells her to not dance so unrestrained, but she thinks thatâs rubbish and continues to dance. At this point, every person in the house is dancing, even the workers. The kitchen has become another dance floor. Ossi dances with a waiter, and Quaker dances with a guest. The band plays on with its unique instruments such as the man slapping another man on the beat. Josef in the other room, continues to gorge himself with food and drinks. While Josef is enjoying himself thoroughly, Nucki is at home eating his usual, pickled herring. His friends barge in and ask him to come along on a spree. At the end of the party, Quaker is tired and sweating like a pig, and Josef is happily still up drinking, sitting in a room filled with his empty bottles. He can barely walk, but somehow makes to the bedroom where Ossi goes in her room and sends him to the other. He tries to grope her and go to her room, but a butler sends him back over to his room. Right after, Quaker goes to the door to sneak a peek on the two, but only finds the lone Ossi already sleeping with her teddy bear, at which he seems not impressed.  Nucki returns from the spree. The men are all drunk and stumble over to some benches to rest. Nucki deliriously stumbles over to speak to a horse on a carriage. That morning, Ossi attends the official breakfast for young women given by the Multi-Millionairesâ Daughters Association Against Dipsomania. They toast, âDown with dipsomania!â They then have their consulting hours, only because their patients will sober up by themselves if they donât cure them first. All of their patients are these drunken old men. Nucki is driven over by the carriage, and is takes in to be helped. When the daughters see Nucki, the only handsome and young man, they go wild, and fight over him, which he doesnât mind at all. They decide to have a boxing match to decide who will cure the man. The women file into a room already dressed in boxing attire, and fight to the last one. Ossi is the last one standing, and immediately falls for Nucki, the raving drunkard. She sneaks in a kiss, and then takes him to a âprivate treatmentâ which just so happens to be in her bedroom. When Ossi leaves, Josef gets up and goes over to peek into Ossiâs room, only to find s man lying in her bed, so he runs to tell Quaker. Ossi returns to Nucki, her patient, and they flirt, and find that they are fond of each other. They kiss, but are upset because they want to be together but she has already been married, and he thinks he has to soon, so they burst out into tears. Josef bursts into the room and realizes that itâs Nucki and starts laughing uncontrollably. He asks them, âDo you know that you two are married to each other?â and then explains to them that he has gotten married under Nuckiâs name. Nucki and Ossi are so happy at this they kiss some more. The real wedding. This time around, it is just the Quaker, and the Bride and groom at a small table. Nucki and Ossi can hardly contain themselves, and escape off to her bedroom without Quaker even noticing. Once he notices that he is the only one left at the table, he goes to find them. He peeks into their room only to find them cuddling in bed. Quaker is so happy that the only thing he can say is, âNow I&#39;m impressed!â'] ["Philosopher Zhuangzi  meets a woman fanning the newly built grave of her dead husband because she desires to marry again.

Speaking to him on the phone is his bride who says she'll be waiting for him at the church. Felix boards his car and heads off. The headlamps on Felix's car are faulty, and one of them goes out. On the way, a motorcycle is coming from the opposite direction, and its rider thought his car is another motorcycle because of only a single light is glowing. Fortunately, the two motorists passed each other without collission. While continuing on his journey, Felix is flagged down by a cop who confronts him about his headlight problem. The cat then comes to a store selling car accessories to replace his lights. He wanted a pair of Mazda light bulbs but the store clerk tells him no stock of the product is available, and therefore makes suggestion of other lights, claiming they would work well also. Felix puts on the regular bulbs on his vehicle, and continues his travel. With one of the lights shining horizontally and other one diagonally upward, Felix is again flagged by a cop who tells him to have them glow on the road. He then tries to adjust their focus but to no avail, and therefore goes on driving. This resulted in disturbed residents on the way firing guns and physically assaulting him. Moments later, his newly replaced lights burn out. As a consequence, Felix's car runs into a tree, then a boulder, and falls off a cliff.

Among them is FranÃ§ois Laurin, a man of jealous and violent temperament, who is married to Ãdith, the daughter of an upright veteran soldier Maria Lazare. FranÃ§ois suspects, correctly, that Ãdith is conducting an affair with the poet Jean Diaz who lives in the village with his mother, and he sends Ãdith to stay with his parents in Lorraine - where she is subsequently captured and raped by German soldiers. FranÃ§ois and Jean find themselves serving in the same battalion at the front, where the initial tensions between them give way to a close friendship which acknowledges that they both love Ãdith. In 1918 Jean is discharged through ill-health and returns to the village, to find his mother dying. Ãdith reappears from captivity, now with a young half-German daughter AngÃ¨le. Her father, Maria Lazare, immediately leaves to avenge the shame to the family name. When FranÃ§ois comes home on leave, Jean and Ãdith fear his reaction to the illegitimate child and try to conceal her from him, which merely revives his jealous suspicions of Jean, and the two men fight. When the truth is revealed, FranÃ§ois and Jean agree to seek their vengeance in battle and both return to the front. In a great battle, in which a mythical figure of Le Gaulois leads on the French forces, FranÃ§ois is wounded and dies in the field hospital.

When he is not treating the poor in his free clinic, he is in his laboratory experimenting. Sir George Carew , the father of his fiancÃ©e, Millicent , is "piqued" by Dr. Jekyll. "No man could be as good as he looks," Carew says.  Following dinner one night, Carew taunts Dr. Jekyll in front of their friends, Edward Enfield , Dr. Lanyon  and Utterson  proclaiming "In devoting yourself to others, Jekyll, aren\'t you neglecting the development of your own life?" "Isn\'t it by serving others that one develops oneself," Jekyll replies. "Which self? Man has two - as he has two hands. Because I use my right hand, should I never use my left? Your really strong man fears nothing. It is the weak one who is afraid of experience. A man cannot destroy the savage in him by denying its impulses. The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it. With your youth, you should live - as I have lived. I have memories. What will you have at my age?" And thus the seed is sown, and Jekyll begins his experiments. As he observes, "Wouldn\'t it be marvellous if the two natures in man could be separated - housed in different bodies? Think what it would mean to yield to every evil impulse, yet leave the soul untouched!" Finally, Jekyll develops a potion that turns him into a hideously evil creature that he calls Edward Hyde. As this creature, he is not recognizable as Dr. Jekyll, and, so, to facilitate the comings and goings of Hyde, he tells his servant, Poole , that Hyde is to have "full authority and liberty about the house." Jekyll thus begins to live his double life. Hyde sets up a room in one of the seediest parts of London. He brings in a girl from the dance hall, Gina , to live with him there and frequents opium dens, dance halls, and bars - any place that satisfies his evil desires. Although Jekyll has developed a potion that will also return him to his original appearance and character as Dr. Jekyll, each time he takes the potion to become Edward Hyde, he worsens. He not only looks more evil, he becomes more evil, as well. Millicent Carew is worried about the absence of her fiancÃ©, so Sir George goes to call on Jekyll to see what is the matter. Although Jekyll is not home when he calls, Sir George encounters Hyde in the street just as he knocks a small boy to the ground injuring him. To make recompense for his actions, he goes and gets a check which he returns to the boy\'s father. Carew notices that the check has been signed by Dr. Jekyll. He confronts Poole who tells him the story of Edward Hyde. In the meantime, Hyde/Jekyll has returned to the lab and, after drinking the potion, returns to his original self. Sir George finds him in the lab and demands to know his relationship with "a vile thing like Hyde?" "What right have you to question me - you who first tempted me?" says Jekyll. Sir George angrily retorts that unless Jekyll is forthcoming with an explanation, he must object to his marriage to Millicent. This angers Jekyll to the point that he suddenly becomes Hyde, right in front of Sir George\'s eyes, without benefit of the potion. Sir George runs into the courtyard where Hyde catches him and clubs him to death with his walking stick. Hyde runs to his apartment and destroys any evidence that may link him to Jekyll. He eludes the police by only minutes and returns to his lab where he is able to drink the potion that restores him as Jekyll. In the ensuing days, as Millicent grieves, Jekyll is tortured by his misdeeds. Soon, the drug needed to make the potion that will return him as Dr. Jekyll is depleted and cannot be found in all of London. Jekyll stays locked up in his lab fearing he may become Hyde at any moment. Millicent finally goes to see him, but just as she is about to enter the lab, he begins to transform into Hyde. Jekyll consumes the poison in the ring he took from the Italian dancer before he opens the door, fully transformed into Hyde. He lets her in, locks the door and grabs her in his arms. Suddenly, he starts convulsing. Millicent runs from the lab and when Lanyon comes in, he finds Hyde sitting in a chair, having just died, and his appearance returned to that of Dr. Jekyll. He discerns that Jekyll committed suicide, and calls the others  in, but declares to them that Hyde has killed Dr. Jekyll. In the final shot, Millicent is grieving next to the body of Dr. Jekyll.'] ["Max and Mary are in love, but Mary's Aunt Agatha dislikes Max, and instead prefers the unappealing Simon.

He sets out to Big Picture Studios to pitch a new script to the Chief, aided by his ever-present sidekicks Dom Bell  and Marty Eggs . His big idea: the first silent motion picture in forty years. At first the Chief , who is in danger of losing the studio to the  rabid and greedy New York conglomerate Engulf & Devour (Harold Gould and [[Ron Carey , rejects the idea, but Funn convinces him that if he can get Hollywood\'s biggest stars to be in the film, he could save the studio. Funn, Eggs, and Bell proceed to recruit various people for the film. Their first target is Burt Reynolds, whom they first surprise in his shower. This does not go well, but they are able to sign him on by appearing at his house in disguise . They recruit James Caan despite a disastrous lunch in his broken trailer, and then torture Liza Minnelli at the commissary . They then disguise themselves as Flamenco dancers to get close to Anne Bancroft at a nightclub, and sign her on as well after a comical dance sequence. News breaks out that the Chief has taken ill and is in the hospital. While there, Mel phones Marcel Marceau in Paris who apparently declines the offer, delivering the only line of dialogue in the film, in French: "Non!" When asked by the others what Marceau said, Funn explains he doesn\'t understand French. It is never stated, but can be inferred that Marceau later changed his mind. Paul Newman is seen on the hospital grounds. After leading them on a wild Hollywood-style chase in electric wheelchairs, he asks to be in the film. Funn and company reply with the typical Hollywood-esque "We\'ll get back to you." In the next shot, a newspaper ad indicates that they rejected Newman. In the process of their search for stars, the trio have a number of brief but funny misadventures, including a mixup between two German Shepherds , a flying blueberry pie, and several  efforts by Marty Eggs to seduce various women. The most notable encounter involves a Coca Cola machine that dispenses cans by launching them like grenades. Engulf and Devour, meanwhile, worry that Funn will save Big Picture Studios and they will be unable to buy it. They attempt to "stop Funn with sex" by sending voluptuous nightclub sensation Vilma Kaplan  to seduce Funn and pretend to be in love with him. Funn falls head over heels, but when Eggs and Bell reveal the truth to him on the day before filming begins, the director returns to drinking. Ironically, moments after this turn of events, Vilma is seen calling Mr. Engulf with the news that she is quitting: she has fallen for Funn for real. She and Funn\'s associates find the director passed-out in a pile of winos, and several hundred cups of coffee sober him up. Funn\'s silent movie is completed in record time. Unfortunately, the only copy of it is stolen from the theater by Engulf & Devour just before its big premiere. Vilma volunteers to stall the theater\'s audience with her nightclub act while Funn and his associates go out to steal back their film. They succeed, but are chased by Engulf and Devour\'s thuggish executives. They are eventually cornered, but fortunately they are near the violent soda machine, which they use against their foes. Most of the executives, including Mr. Devour, are disabled by the exploding cans of Coke, allowing Funn, Eggs, and Bell to escape. They hurry the film to the theater, where it is shown for the first time. After the movie is over, the audience applauds wildly and leaps to its feet while balloons and streamers fill the air. "They seem to like it," Funn says. The film ends with the jubilant audience filing out of the theater past Funn, Eggs, Bell, Vilma, and the recovered studio chief. At the end, a title card is shown: "This is a true story."'] ['Farina, Joe and Mickey are all struck by the love bug.

After that, the story changes to a modern setting involving living by the lessons of the commandments. Two brothers make opposite decisions, one, John, to follow his mother's teaching of the ten commandments and become a poor carpenter, and the other, Danny, to break every one of them and rise to the top. The film shows his unchecked immorality to be momentarily gainful, but ultimately disastrous. A thoughtful contrast is made between the carpenter brother and his mother. The mother reads the story of Moses and emphasizes strict obedience and fear of God. The carpenter, however, reads from the New Testament story of Jesus' healing of lepers. His emphasis is on a loving and forgiving God. The film also shows the mother's strict lawful morality to be flawed in comparison to her son's version. Danny becomes a corrupt contractor who builds a church with shoddy concrete, pocketing the money saved and becoming very rich. One day, his mother comes to visit him at his work site, but the walls are becoming unstable due to the shaking of heavy trucks on nearby roads. One of the walls collapses on top of the mother, killing her. In her dying breath, she tells Danny that it is her fault for teaching him to fear God, when she should have taught him love. This sends Danny on a downward spiral as he attempts to right his wrongs and clear his conscience, but he only gets into more trouble. To make money, he steals pearls from his mistress, and when she fights back, he kills her. He attempts to flee to Mexico on a motorboat, but rough weather sends him off course and he crashes into a rocky island, where he is presumably killed. Throughout the film, the visual motif of the tablets of the commandments appears in the sets, with a particular commandment appearing on them when it is relevant to the story."] ["Edna's father wants her to marry wealthy Count Chloride de Lime.

Of course, Laurel and Hardy establish themselves as the epicenter of the difficulties: somehow, they get out of synch with the other musicians, so when the conductor taps his baton for the band to stand up, The Boys sit down; another tap, and the band sits while The Boys stand up. Up and down, down and up â it takes a look-that-could-kill from the maestro to wilt the two back into their chairs. He gets the music rolling then, and it seems to proceed well: the group plays a passage, then the soloists stand and contribute â a trumpet first, then a trombone, until the clarinetist is called upon for his solo â and the cutaway shows him still sorting through his music charts with his friend, Mr. Hardy. Another up-close-and-personal staredown gets a bleat from Stan\'s woodwind that blows the hat off the maestro and is unmistakably a sour note â even though it\'s a silent picture. Touchingly, Ollie stands and provides the needed solo line from his French horn for his friend. Stan\'s performance is dealt another blow when his clarinet comes all apart in his hands, then a particularly robust riff from the trombonist behind him blows his music from its stand over to the conductor\'s podium and under his feet. Stan plucks the music â the French horn music â from Ollie\'s stand, sending him over to retrieve the sheets from under the maestro\'s stomping foot. When Ollie returns with the charts, he sees that they are for b-flat clarinet, and there is a musical twist on the wrong-hat swap. The kerfuffle over the music causes all the music stands  to tumble over like so many dominoes. Back at their boardinghouse, The Boys settle in for a hearty meal â the pleasure of which is blunted when they find a note from the landlady: "In the excitement of having a job, you have overlooked 14 weeks board bill." Ollie tucks it away for postprandial attention, but then the top falls off the pepper shaker and befouls his soup; he swaps his bowl with Stan\'s, and the salt shaker top falls off and ruins this second bowl. The landlady asks a boy at the table how the concert was, and he says, "It was great â after they was fired," pointing at The Boys. Wordlessly, they rise slowly from the table and are met at the door by the landlady, who is holding the totality of their worldly goods: one clarinet, one French horn â and two derbies. A title card announces: "Re-financing â In business for themselves" and we pick them up on a street corner, instruments in hand. Even without the benefit of a soundtrack, the visuals alone are convincing that they are as sorry a duo as they were cogs in the ensemble: the exaggerated, uncoordinated foot stomping, the attempts to play the first note together, the rapid unraveling of the effort. You do not have to hear them to know how bad they are.  Sadly, they are unaware that their difficulties here are just an overture to those upcoming. First, a policeman comes by and asks if they have a license. "We have no dog," a befuddled Ollie answers â and the resulting bum\'s rush from the officer finds them seeking out a new corner. The new locale doesn\'t ease the musical discord, though, so a friendly drunk offers to serve as conductor, until his zeal with his walking stick raps Stan on the knuckles. The cop\'s return sends them off yet again, and first Stan, then Ollie, fall into manholes. To add incendiary to insult, Ollie gets a blowtorch to the backside by an irate subterranean worker. One last try to earn a living through music: The Boys play a selection directly to a cross-eyed passerby who pauses, listens, digs in his vest pocket as if for a coin â then strides away without contributing when they pass the hats, both of them. It is too much for Ollie: he takes Stan\'s clarinet and breaks it over his knee, which in turn is too much for Stan, who kicks the French horn under a passing steam roller. Ollie picks up his squashed instrument, blows into it, and pronounces it "Flat." The Boys then enter into an atypical extended tit-for-tat routine against one another, escalating from shin-kicking through hanky-tearing, then jacket-ripping, button-popping and hat-stomping. A man emerging from the ABC Restaurant finds himself involved, and the melee quickly widens to some two dozen well-dressed adult male participants. It takes a surreal turn with the de-pantsing first of Hardy by Laurel, then of everyone by his adjacent combatant, until all are displaying their  BVDs â including the policeman. From the swirling maelstrom of boxer shorts, we cut to a solitary king-size gentleman, alone in the frame, with his arms up, his pants gone and his chubby pale legs peeking out from gleaming white shorts: "I\'ve been robbed!" he cries. It\'s instantly clear what happened when we see Stan and Ollie â walking together, finally in synch, in the enormous trousers â tipping their derbies at the audience as they exit the shot.'] ['A newspaper journalist, Stanley Lane , discovers a German spy ring in Sydney led by Carl Hoffman (Charles Villiers}.

Its opening scenes show the bustling traffic of central Berlin. The action of the movie centres on five central characters, and takes place over a single weekend. At the start of the movie, a handsome young man, Wolfgang  sees a pretty girl  who seems to be waiting in the street for someone who has not arrived. He takes her for an ice cream, teases her about having been stood up, and invites her to come for a picnic the following day. In the meantime, Erwin is carrying out his own day job as a taxi driver. While he is fixing the car, his depot receives a phone call from his wife, Annie , who wants to know if they are going to the cinema that evening. Erwin clearly is not keen to go - he simply comments that Greta Garbo is showing until the following Tuesday.  At the end of the day, Erwin returns home to find Annie moping about - she seems to spend most of her time lying on the bed in a fairly threadbare apartment. The couple start to get ready to go to the cinema, but they continually bicker with each other. The first row is over the pictures of movie stars in their bathroom - it is clear that all the actors are there for Annie\'s benefit, while the actresses are there for Erwin, because they punish each other by tearing up each other\'s photos. Another row is over whether Annie should wear the brim of her hat up or down.  Wolfgang arrives in the middle of this argument, so Annie never gets to the cinema. Instead, Erwin and Wolfgang drink beer and plan to go to the countryside the following day. As a result, the following morning finds the two men taking a train to Nikolassee, accompanied by Christl and her friend Brigitte . Many Berliners seem to have the same idea - Nikolassee offers a beach, a lake, parkland, and a pine forest where daytrippers can spend a relaxing few hours. We see many such Berliners of all ages enjoying themselves on a Sunday at Nikolassee, including the four young people who are the focus of the film. As the four friends have a picnic, swim in the lake, and play records on a portable gramophone, Wolfgang flirts with Brigitte, to the annoyance of Christl. At one point, after lying down with his arms round both women, Wolfgang play-chases Brigitte into the forest, where they find a secluded spot and begin to make love.  Afterwards, the four friends go for a boat-ride, where Erwin and Wolfgang manage to flirt with two girls who are in a rowing boat on the middle of the lake. As they head back into Berlin, Brigitte suggests to Wolfgang that they meet again the following Sunday. He agrees, but Erwin reminds him afterwards that they had planned instead to go and watch a football match. It is not clear what they will decide to do, in fact - although it is clear that the two young men enjoy their carefree existence, without much regard for the feelings or wishes of the young women around them. The final scene returns to shots of the streets of Berlin. The closing series of intertitles announces: "And then on Monday...it is back to work... back to the everyday... back to the daily grind... Four... million... wait for... the next Sunday. The end." Contemporary critics regarded the movie as an accurate and laconic portrayal of the Berlin they knewCITYGIRLS_s035_060 and saw the closing intertitles as an accurate claim that these characters represent ordinary real life Berliners. However, these closing words have also acquired an ironic poignancy today, since we are aware that it is not a carefree Sunday but the tragedy of Nazism that awaits the inhabitants of Berlin  in their very near future.'] [" After her father is killed by an outlaw, Dolores  marries Peter.

In addition, several large scale models are employed to demonstrate medieval concepts of the structure of the solar system and the commonly accepted depiction of Hell.  A series of vignettes theatrically demonstrating medieval superstition and beliefs concerning witchcraft, including Satan  tempting a sleeping woman away from her husband\'s bed and terrorizing a group of monks. Also shown is a woman purchasing a love potion from a supposed witch, and a sequence showing a supposed witch dreaming of flying through the air and attending a witches\' gathering.  A long narrative broken up into several parts; set in the Middle Ages, it concerns an old woman accused of witchcraft by a dying man\'s family. The narrative is used to demonstrate the treatment of suspected witches by the religious authorities of the time. The old woman, after being tortured, admits to heavy involvement in witchcraft, including detailed descriptions of a Witches\' Sabbath, even going so far as to "name" other supposed witches, including two of the women in the dying man\'s household. Eventually, the dying man\'s wife is arrested as a witch when she admits that she falsely accused the old woman of witchcraft.  The final part of the film seeks to demonstrate how the superstitions of old are better understood now. Christensen seeks to make the claim that most who were accused of witchcraft were possibly mentally ill, and in modern times, such behavior is interpreted as a disease. His case revolves around vignettes about a somnambulist and a kleptomaniac, the implication being that these behaviors would have been thought of as demonically-influenced in medieval times whereas modern times recognizes them as psychological ailments. There is heavy irony, however, in the observation that the "temperate shower of the clinic" i.e. the treatment of "hysterical women" in a modern institution, has replaced medieval solutions such as burning at the stake.'] ["Dimples is a young girl, whose father dies.

The film opens with the debut of the new season at the Paris Opera House, with a production of Gounod\'s Faust. Comte Philippe de Chagny  and his brother, the Vicomte Raoul de Chagny  are in attendance. Raoul attends only in the hope of hearing his sweetheart Christine Daae  sing. Christine, secretly under the tuition The Phantom, has made a sudden rise from the chorus to understudy of the prima donna. Raoul wishes for Christine to resign and marry him, but she refuses to let their relationship get in the way of her career. The Phantom demands that Christine be placed in the lead role for the next opera. At the height of the most prosperous season in the Opera\'s history, the management suddenly resign. As they leave, they tell the new managers of the Opera Ghost, a phantom who asks for opera box #5, among other things. The new managers laugh it off as a joke, but the old management leaves troubled. The managers go to Box 5 to see exactly who has taken it. The keeper of the box does not know who it is, as she has never seen his face. The two managers enter the box and are startled to see a shadowy figure seated. They run out of the box and compose themselves, but when they enter the box again, the person is gone. After the performance, the ballet girls are disturbed by the sight of a mysterious man , who dwells in the cellars. Arguing whether or not he is the Phantom, they decide to ask Joseph Buquet, a stagehand who has actually seen the ghost\'s face. Buquet describes a ghastly sight of a living skeleton to the girls, who are then startled by a shadow cast on the wall. The antics of stagehand Florine Papillon  do not amuse Joseph\'s brother, Simon , who chases him off. Meanwhile, Mme.

In her next performance, Christine reaches her triumph during the finale and receives a standing ovation from the audience. When Raoul visits her in her dressing room, she pretends not to recognize him, because unbeknownst to the rest there, The Phantom is also there. Raoul spends the evening outside her door, and after the others have left, just as he is about to enter, he hears The Phantom\'s voice within the room. He overhears the voice make his intentions to Christine: "Soon, Christine, this spirit will take form and will demand your love!" When Christine leaves her room alone, Raoul breaks in to find it empty. Carlotta receives another discordant note from the Phantom. Once again, it demands that she take ill and let Christine have her part. The managers also get a note, reiterating that if Christine does not sing, they will present "Faust" in a house with a curse on it.  The following evening, despite the Phantom\'s warnings, a defiant Carlotta appears as Marguerite. At first, the performance goes well, but soon the Phantom\'s curse takes its effect, causing the great, crystal chandelier to fall down onto the audience. Christine runs to her dressing room and is entranced by a mysterious voice through a secret door behind the mirror, descending, in a dream-like sequence, semi-conscious on horseback by a winding staircase into the lower depths of the Opera. She is then taken by gondola over a subterranean lake by the masked Phantom into his lair. The Phantom introduces himself as Erik and declares his love; Christine faints, so Erik carries her to a suite fabricated for her comfort. The next day, when she awakens, she finds a note from Erik telling her that she is free to come and go as she pleases, but that she must never look behind his mask. In the next room, the Phantom is playing his composition, "Don Juan Triumphant." Christine\'s curiosity gets the better of her, and she sneaks up behind the Phantom and tears off his mask, revealing his hideously deformed face. Enraged, the Phantom makes his plans to hold her prisoner known. In an attempt to plead to him, he excuses her to visit her world one last time, with the condition that she never sees her lover again.

While on the roof, Christine tells Raoul everything. However, an unseen jealous Phantom perching on the statue of Apollo overhears them. Raoul and Inspector Ledoux  are then lured into the Phantom\'s underground death-trap when Christine is kidnapped while onstage. Philippe is drowned by Erik when he goes looking for Raoul in the cellars of the Opera. The Phantom gives Christine a choice of two levers: one shaped like a scorpion and the other like a grasshopper. One of them will save Raoul, while the other will blow up the Opera. Christine picks the scorpion, but it is a trick by the Phantom to "save" Raoul and Ledoux from being blown up &mdash; by drowning them. Christine begs the Phantom to save Raoul, promising him anything in return. At the last second, the Phantom opens a trapdoor in his floor through which Raoul and Ledoux are saved. The Phantom attempts to flee with Christine in a stolen carriage. While Raoul saves Christine, Erik/Phantom is pursued and killed by a mob, who throw him into the Seine River to finally drown. In the original 1925 version, there was a short scene showing Christine and Raoul on a honeymoon. An alternate ending features the Phantom letting Christine and Raoul go after realizing that Christine truly loves Raoul and not him. Christine gives the Phantom her ring, then departs with Raoul. The Phantom shrieks in pain and falls over dead, of a broken heart.'] ['Burglars Molly Brian  and Joe Hagney ([[John Patrick  break into the Vickers mansion on Long Island and loot the safe but are caught in the act by another crook, Jerry Winters , who takes the money from them.

The capture of Ned is shot from the viewpoint of the police, as Ned advances, an impressive figure weaving towards them under the weight of his armour and the shock of the bullets. According to the synopsis given in the surviving program, the film originally comprised six sequences. Some confusion regarding the plot has emerged as a result of a variant poster from the film dating from 1910. Its similar  photos suggest that either the film was being added to, or altered, or an entirely new version was made by Johnson and Gibson, as the poster proclaims.http://www.prov.vic.gov.au/provcasts/images/NedKellyPosterBefore2.jpg Fragments of another version of the story, âthe Perth fragment,â shows Aaron Sherritt being shot outside, in front of an obviously painted canvas flat.

In the third part we get much more of Oâs perception of the room and its contents. In order to distinguish between the two perceptions, objects seen by O were shot through a lens-gauze, blurring his perception while E's perception was shot without gauze or filters, keeping the images sharp.  The film opens onto a rippled image that fills the entire screen. Without colour it is hard at first to tell what weâre looking at but it is alive. As it moves we realise it is an extreme close-up of an eyelid; it fills the entire screen. The eye opens, slowly, closes, opens again, blinks and then fades into a different rippled image, still somewhat organic but changed, still.âWhen the rushes of the first frenetic dayâs outdoor filming were viewed, it was clear that it had been an almost total disaster â¦ Yet the budget did not allow for the scene to be reshot â¦ Hours were spent getting the exact close-up that they required of Buster Keatonâs âcreased, reptilianâ eye to replace the abandoned outdoor scene with the extras.â â Knowlson, J., Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett , pp 523,524 As the camera begins to pan right and up and we realise it is a wall; we are outside a building . It is summer though it is hard to tell. The cameraâs movement is not smooth. It is as if it is looking for something. Eventually it loses interest and pans left and down back to the wall. Suddenly the camera  shifts violently to the left. A man is hurrying along the wall from left to right. He pauses, hugging the wall and E gets a chance to focus on him. He has on a long dark overcoat, the collar of which is turned up and his hat is pulled down over his face. He is hanging onto a briefcase with his left hand whilst trying to shield the exposed side of his face with the other. He realises heâs been seen and cowers against the wall; E quickly shifts behind him. No longer conscious of being observed, O starts off again, knocking over a trestle, stumbling over a railway sleeper, anything to stay as close as possible to the wall. He charges into a man and woman, knocking the manâs hat off. E looks from the manâs face to the womanâs and back again. The man has a moustache and is wearing a pince-nez. They have been consulting a newspaper which the woman keeps hold of. They both look appalled at what has happened. E moves back to a long shot and watches O barge through and on his way. The man replaces his hat, takes off his pince-nez and looks after the fleeing figure. The couple look at each other and the man âopens his mouth to vituperateâBeckett, S., Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett , p 165 but the woman shushes him, uttering the only sound in the whole play. Together they turn to stare directly at E and, as they do, an open-mouthed expression takes over their faces; they canât bear to look at what theyâve seen and turn their faces away. The action shifts back to O just as he reaches and turns a corner. He heads off down the street until he realises he is at the right doorway. He enters.  The camera cuts to the vestibule. We are directly behind O. The stairs lead up on the left, but O veers right and pauses, pulling himself together. He takes his pulse and E moves in. As soon as he becomes aware of E's presence he rushes down a couple of steps and cowers beside the wall until the camera retreats a little. When it does he reverses back up to street-level and then begins up the stairs. A frail old woman is coming down. The camera gives us a brief close-up. âShe carries a tray of flowers slung from her neck by a strap. She descends slowly and with fumbling feet.âBeckett, S., Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett , p 166 O backs up and hurries down the steps to the right again where he sits down on a step and presses his face against the balusters. He glances up briefly to see where she is then hides his head from view. As the woman reaches the bottom of the stairs she looks straight into the lens. The expression on her face changes to the one of wide-eyed horror that we saw displayed on the faces of the man and woman outside. She closes her eyes and collapses. E checks on where the man had been, but O has made his escape. We just catch his coat tails flying up the stairs. E chases after him and finds him at the top of the first flight. He looks around to see if there is anyone about. Satisfied he turns left and, not without some difficulty, opens the door to a room and enters. E slips in unnoticed as O locks the door behind him and then takes his pulse once more.  We find ourselves in a âsmall barely furnished room.Beckettâs notes identify this as the manâs motherâs room. This recalls Molloyâs return to his motherâs room/womb/tomb to die. â Ackerley, C. J. and Gontarski, S.

Systematically O takes each object or creature in the room and disables its ability to âseeâ him: he closes the blind and pulls the net curtains across, he covers the mirror with the rug, the cat and dog (âa shy and uncooperative, little ChihuahuaâKnowlson, J., Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett  are â with some difficulty â ejected from the room and the picture is torn up. Although stated simply the mechanics needed to execute these tasks are laborious, e.g. as he passes the window he hides behind the blanket which he holds in front of himself to cover the mirror and he carries the cat and dog facing away from him as he tries to put them out the door. After all the above he goes to sit in the chair. There are two holes in the headrest that suggest eyes.In his manuscript notes Beckett had not envisioned these âeyeâ holes but had written âMake chair back memorableâ and foresaw an âupright back, intersecting wooden bars or lozengesâ. â Notes for Film , quoted in Knowlson, J., Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett , p 802 n 54 He ignores them and sits.

As O begins to doze off, E begins to move round to his left. Suddenly O realises he is being watched and turns his head violently to the right. E moves behind him again. He resumes rocking and dozes off. This time E whirls round to the right, passing the window, the mirror, the birdcage and fishbowl and finally stops in front of the space on the wall where the picture was. E turns around and, for the first time, we are face-to-face with O, asleep in his rocking chair. All of a sudden he wakes and stares straight into the camera lens. He looks very much like the man in the seventh photograph only much older. He still has the eye patch. He half starts from the chair then stiffens. Gradually the horrified look we have seen before on the couple and the old womanâs faces appears on his. He is looking at himself but not the scruffy, wearish man we have been watching, the man before him, standing with a big nail beside his head, has a look of âacute intentnessâBeckett, S., Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett , p 169 on his face. O slumps back into the chair and starts rocking. He closes his eye and the expression fades. He covers his face with his hands briefly and then looks again. This time we see the face of E in close-up, just the eyes. O covers his eyes again, bows his head. The rocking dies down and then stops. The screen goes black. We then see the opening image of the eye, which is frozen, and the credits are presented over it. Once finished, the eye closes and the film is over."] ['Set in Caldwell, Kansas on the Kansas-Oklahoma border, the movie features cowboy Don Carver  as a "tumbleweed"  who decides to settle down after falling in love with Molly Lassiter ([[Barbara Bedford .

Soon the Canfield paterfamilias knows the young McKay is in town and he\'s coming to dinner that night.

After triumphing, he morphs into modern day Ned Thacker . Ned is born and raised in Kansas by a mother who passes along to him her love of D\'Artagnan and The Three Musketeers, despite his father\'s concern that it is not good for him. In fact, Ned does get into trouble with his  chivalrous attempts to help women. Finally, Ned can stand it no more; he decides to leave dull Kansas. In mirroring scenes, D\'Artagnan is astride a somewhat less-than-noble steed, a present from his father for his departure from home, while Ned\'s father gives him the modern equivalent: a car. While driving in the desert, he comes upon a chauffeur-driven automobile stopped because the road ahead has been washed away. Unimpressed with one passenger, the middle-aged Forrest Vandeteer , Ned is quite taken with the lovely "Park Avenue flapper" Elsie Dodge. Her mother, the third passenger, sees her only daughter\'s marriage to Vandeteer as the solution to their dire financial straits. Vandeteer buys what he wants, and he wants Elsie. She, however, loathes her suitor; she much prefers young Ned. Ned comes up with the idea to put his car on railroad tracks. He takes the party  to their Grand Canyon resort hotel. There, Ned questions John Blabb, who works for "Town Topics". Blabb informs him that Vandeteer already has three wives hidden away somewhere.

Baptiste eventually sacrifices the love of this girl of his dreams, goes back to his own people and marries the daughter of a preacher.

It opens with Keaton attending a variety show. In this first sequence, Keaton plays beside him and remarks, "This fellow Keaton seems to be the whole show." This was a gibe at one of Keaton\'s contemporaries, Thomas Ince, who credited himself generously in his film productions.The theater and cinema of Buster Keaton By Robert Knopf, page 27 In interviews with Kevin Brownlow{{cite book}}, Keaton claims he gave the director\'s credit to Cline mainly because he did not want to appear too Ince-like himself: "Having kidded things like that, I hesitated to put my own name on as a director and writer."

Sommer is arrested and sentenced three years in prison. Sommer is kept in large cell with four other people, one of which, Steinau , is soon acquitted and promises Sommer to help his wife while he\'s incarcerated. This he does by giving her a better job at his business and offering her his friendship while they both work to get Sommer out. For much of the remainder of the film, the men\'s sexual frustration from being separated from women is the focus, with scenes such as making nude sculptures from breadcrumbs and water and fighting for a woman\'s handkerchief smuggled in from visitation.

He shows it to Sommer, who does not respond. That night, Sommer, seeing Marquis completely absorbed in thought, asks him what he is thinking about. Marquis asks if his nonresponse means he hates him and holds out his hand. Sommer takes it, and begins moving into Marquis\'s bed as the scene fades to an exterior night shot of the prison. The next day, Helene arranges with the warden for a private visit with Sommer, where she intends to tell him about Steinau, but she does not. Nor does Sommer say anything. The short meeting is awkward and distant. Later, Steinau makes his presentation calling for a penal system reform, but the representative is unswayed. Steinau asks Helene to divorce Sommer and marry him, but she refuses. Marquis is released, and Sommer shortly after him. Marquis is briefly seen by the river with another man, happily commenting that Sommer got out today. The other man cynically responds that he could make a good deal of money if Sommer is rich, to which Marquis takes offense and walks away. Though not spelled out, the suggestion is that one could use Paragraph 175  to blackmail Sommer, in the a same way that it is used against Paul KÃ¶rner in Different From the Others. Sommer goes home, where his wife is happy to see him, and he is happy to be free, but confesses he no longer loves her. Helene thinks he has found out about Steinau, but when she mentions him, he knows nothing of it.

Wu swears he will raise the child as a daughter and a son. As Mr. Wu\'s daughter, Nang Ping, emerges into womanhood, he arranges a marriage for her with a mandarin. A lively, spirited girl, she has been educated by her father\'s old tutor. Despite the seclusion of her father\'s palace, she meets and falls in love with Basil Gregory, a young Englishman. His father is a diplomat who does not respect Chinese ways and insults the "damned Chinks" to their faces, although the rest of his family is courteous. Basil later informs Nang Ping that he must return to Britain with his family, but she surprises him with the revelation that she carries his child. Later, Basil indicates he indeed wants to marry her, but she then claims she was merely trying to establish if he was an "honorable man", and reveals she is already engaged in an arranged marriage. Via a nosy gardener, Nang Ping\'s father discovers the relationship. While Wu agonizingly peruses his culture\'s ancient writings, he comes to the conclusion that a dishonored daughter must "die by the hand of her father." Despite his great tenderness and love for her, he interprets customary Chinese law as grimly necessitating Nang Ping\'s execution. Father and daughter bid each other a tearful goodbye, she asks him to spare her lover, indicating that would make death less painful and less meaningless for her. She then obediently retreats to the home\'s central shrine. The last scene of that act concludes as the curtain dramatically drops over the profile of Wu lifting his sword high above his daughter\'s prostrate form. Wu then goes about exacting revenge on the Gregory family, whom he feels is responsible for the "dishonor" and subsequent death of his daughter. He invites Mrs. Gregory and her daughter to his home and tricks the daughter into going into Nang Ping\'s room, immediately locking her in, imprisoning her on the room\'s raised outdoor terrace. He has Basil tied up in an adjacent garden, flanked by an axe-wielding servant. By sunset, Mrs. Gregory has the choice of either condemning her son to death or her daughter to prostitution. She says there is another way and offers her own life. Wu explains that this is not the custom in China; the parents are obliged to live on and bear the shame. Nonetheless, Mrs. Gregory continues to insist Wu take her life instead of those of her children, and in an ensuing struggle, Mrs. Gregory stabs Wu with a knife from a nearby desk, thus freeing herself, and ultimately, her daughter and Basil. Wu staggers to strike the gong to signal that Basil should be killed anyway, but a vision of Nang Ping appears, shaking her head and imploring her father with outstretched arms. Pursuing the ghostly image into the hall, Wu dies and is found by his old friend and tutor, who picks up Wu\'s prayer beads and says "Thus passes the House of Wu."'] ['Legend Barney Oldfield stars in this early Sennett comedy.

A sleazy extortionist threatens to expose KÃ¶rner as a homosexual. Flashbacks show us how KÃ¶rner became aware of his orientation and tried first to change it, then to understand it. KÃ¶rner and the extortionist end up in court, where the judge is sympathetic to the violinist, but when the scandal becomes public, his career is ruined and he is driven to suicide. The film opens with Paul KÃ¶rner  reading the daily newspaper obituaries, which are filled with vaguely worded and seemingly inexplicable suicides. KÃ¶rner, however, knows that Paragraph 175 is hidden behind them all &mdash; that it hangs over German homosexuals "like the Sword of Damocles." After this thesis statement, the main plot begins. Kurt Sivers ([[Fritz Schulz  is a fan and admirer of KÃ¶rner, a violin virtuoso, and he approaches KÃ¶rner in hopes of becoming a student of his. KÃ¶rner agrees and they begin lessons together, during which they fall for one another. Both men experience the disapproval of their parents. Neither are out, but Sivers\'s object to the increasingly large amount of attention he focuses on the violin and his unusual infatuation with KÃ¶rner, and the KÃ¶rners do not understand why he has shown no interest in finding a wife and starting a family. KÃ¶rner sends his parents to see his mentor, the Doctor . The Doctor appears several times in the film, each time to deliver speeches more intended for the audience than the advancement of the plot. In this, his first appearance, he tells KÃ¶rner\'s parents: {{cquote}} After KÃ¶rner\'s coming out, he and Sivers begin seeing each other more openly. While walking together, hand in hand, through the park, they pass a man who recognizes KÃ¶rner. Later that day, when KÃ¶rner is alone, this man, Franz Bollek  confronts him and demands hush money or else he will expose Sivers. KÃ¶rner pays him and keeps it a secret from Sivers that he does so. Eventually, however, the blackmailer\'s demands become too great and KÃ¶rner refuses to pay.  Bollek decides instead to break into KÃ¶rner\'s house while he and Sivers are performing, but he is discovered by Sivers and KÃ¶rner on their return and a fight breaks out. In the course of the fight, Bollek reveals to Sivers that he has been blackmailing him. Sivers runs away and faces hardships trying to survive alone. KÃ¶rner is left dejected and, over a photo of Sivers, remembers his past. His first memory is of boarding school, when he and his boyfriend Max are discovered kissing by their teacher and he\'s expelled. Next, he remembers University and his solitary and lonely life there, and the growing impossibility of trying to play straight. He remembers trying an ex-gay hypnotherapist, but finding him only to be a charlatan. Then he first met the Doctor, whose reaction was much different from those he had previously met. Among other things, he told him: {{cquote}} Remembering on, he recalled first meeting Bollek at a gay dance hall, and Bollek leading him on before ultimately turning on him and using his homosexuality to blackmail him. Back in the present, KÃ¶rner takes Else Sivers , Kurt Sivers\' sister, to the Doctor\'s lecture on alternative sexuality. The Doctor speaks on topics such as homosexuality, lesbianism, gender identity, intersexuality, the perils of stereotypes, and the idea that sexuality is physically determined, rather than a mental condition. KÃ¶rner reports Bollek for blackmail and has him arrested. In retaliation, Bollek exposes KÃ¶rner. The Doctor gives testimony on KÃ¶rner\'s behalf, but both are found guilty of their respective crimes. Bollek is sentenced to three years for extortion. The judge is sympathetic to KÃ¶rner, and gives him the minimum sentence allowable: one week. Allowed to go home before his starting his term, KÃ¶rner finds himself shunned by friends and strangers alike, and no longer employable. Even his family tells him there is only one honorable way out. He attempts to dance wearing only Max\'s old lederhosen but slips over. He then takes a handful of pills and kills himself. Sivers rushes to his side as he lies dead. KÃ¶rner\'s parents blame Sivers for what has happened, but Else harshly rebukes them. Meanwhile, Sivers attempts to kill himself as well, but the Doctor prevents him and delivers his final speech: {{cquote}} The movie closes with an open German law book, turned to Paragraph 175, as a hand holding a brush crosses it out.'] ["Terry O'Neil  is the youngest of a group of Irish-American firefighting brothers.

He visits gambling dens by night under various guises and aliases, using the power of suggestion to win at cards and finance his plans. Among his many henchmen are: Spoerri, his cocaine-addicted manservant; Georg, his chauffeur and sometime assassin; Petsch, an inept goon; Hawasch, who employs a gang of blind men in a counterfeiting operation; Fine, a woman who serves as a lookout; and Folies BergÃ¨re dancer Cara Carozza, who loves him. As the film opens, Mabuse orchestrates the theft of a commercial contract in order to create a temporary panic in the stock market, which he exploits to make huge profits. Edgar Hull, the son of a millionaire industrialist, becomes Mabuseâs next victim. As "Hugo Balling", Mabuse gains access to Hull\'s gentlemen\'s club and wins a small fortune at cards from the hypnotized Hull, who is made to play badly and recklessly. Afterwards, Hull is unable to account for his behavior. State prosecutor Norbert von Wenk takes an interest in Hull, believing he is the latest in a string of victims similarly tricked by the elusive "Great Unknown". Von Wenk goes undercover at a gambling den, where he encounters a disguised Dr. Mabuse. Mabuse attempts to hypnotize von Wenk, but he effectively resists. Mabuse flees. Von Wenk, quickly regaining his faculties, gives chase through the city, but the doctor escapes. Boarding a taxicab driven by Georg, von Wenk is gassed, robbed, and set adrift in a rowboat. Dr. Mabuse realizes that Hull is assisting the state prosecutor, and resolves to eliminate both men. Carozza, who has been romancing Hull on Mabuse\'s orders, lures the young man to a new illegal casino; when von Wenk calls in the police to raid the place, Carozza, Hull and a police bodyguard exit through the back door, where Georg awaits. He kills Hull, but Carozza is caught and jailed. Von Wenk questions her for information about the "Great Unknown", but she refuses to speak. Von Wenk enlists the aid of Countess Told , an aristocrat bored by her dull husband and seeking thrills wherever she can find them, to try to get the information by trickery. The countess is placed in the same cell, an apparent victim of another raid, but Carozza is not fooled. Carozza reveals only her great love for Mabuse, ensuring her silence. The countess, moved by Carozza\'s passion, tells von Wenk that she cannot continue to assist him. Dr. Mabuse does nothing to extricate Carozza from jail. He instead attends a sÃ©ance where he meets Countess Told, who  invites him to her house. Once there, Mabuse, taken by the Countess\'s beauty, decides to display his power by telepathically inducing her husband, Count Told, to cheat at poker. His guests are outraged when they detect it, and the Countess faints. Dr. Mabuse uses the distraction to abduct her and imprison her in his lair. Part II â Inferno: A Game for the People of our Age  A sick and disgraced Count Told seeks the help of Dr. Mabuse to treat his depression; Mabuse uses this chance to isolate the count in his manor and cut off any inquiries about the countess\'s whereabouts. The countâs condition worsens, and he is tormented by hallucinations. Meanwhile, Carozza is moved to a womanâs prison and again interrogated by von Wenk. Fearing betrayal, Mabuse sanctions Carozzaâs death. Georg smuggles poison to her cell, which she takes out of loyalty. Another of Mabuseâs henchmen, Pesch, bombs von Wenk\'s office while posing as an electrician, but von Wenk is unharmed and Pesch detained. Mabuse â again fearing betrayal â arranges for Petsch to be killed by a sniper while being transported in a police wagon. Intent on leaving town, Mabuse gives the captive countess the choice of going with him voluntarily. Her refusal angers him, and Mabuse vows that he will kill the count. Through his powers of suggestion, he induces the count to commit suicide with a razor blade. When von Wenk investigates his death, he questions Dr. Mabuse as the countâs psychoanalyst. Dr. Mabuse speculates that the count had fallen under the control of a hostile will, and asks von Wenk if he is familiar with the experiments of one âSandor Weltemannâ, who will be performing a public demonstration of telepathy and mass hypnosis at a local theater. Von Wenk and his men attend Weltemannâs show. Weltemann is none other than Mabuse in disguise, and his magic show provides him an opportunity to hypnotize von Wenk, who falls into a trance. Mabuse\'s secret command to von Wenk is to leave the auditorium, get in his car, and drive off a cliff, but von Wenkâs men intercede just in time. Coming to his senses, von Wenk orders a siege of Mabuse\'s house. Dr. Mabuse and his men make a final stand. In the ensuing gunfight, Hawasch and Fine are killed, Spoerri and Georg are taken into custody, and the countess is rescued. Dr. Mabuse flees through an underground sewer to Hawaschâs counterfeiting workshop, where he becomes trapped, as the doors cannot be opened from the inside. There, Mabuse is confronted by the ghosts of his victims and various demonic illusions. Spoerri, under interrogation, identifies a key found at Mabuse\'s mansion as being for the workshop. Von Wenk and the police break in and take the now-insane Dr. Mabuse away. In Das Testament des Dr. Mabuse  it is revealed that he is confined to an insane asylum.'] ['Lloyd is a serious young middle-class guy on the make, who wants to marry the bossâ daughter.

The wind blows some pages from a newspaper across the road, startling the two horses and causing them to bolt. As the horses take the wagon around a curve at high speed, John\'s wife is thrown from the vehicle and killed instantly. Disillusioned, John adopts a reclusive life on the sea, sailing along the Atlantic coast in his schooner Yankee, accompanied only by his ship\'s mate, Paul Halvard. One afternoon the men steer the Yankee across a bar into an inlet along the Georgia coast. The approach of John\'s schooner is watched disapprovingly by two men âLitchfield Stope, master of the once-grand house that sits on the inlet, who developed a lifelong distrust of strangers during the American Civil War, and Nicholas, a maniacal brutish man who has bullied his way into Stope\'s household. At the same time, John is standing on the deck of his boat and surveying the shore through a pair of binoculars. Woolfolk notices the once-grand house. He also spies a young woman swimming near the shore â Millie Stope, Litchfield\'s granddaughter. After anchoring the Yankee, John takes a rowboat ashore. As he makes his way toward the Stope\'s house, he picks a couple of wild oranges off a tree. Millie comes out of the house and asks, "What do you want?" "I came ashore to arrange for a supply of water â but I\'ve stolen your oranges," John replies. "We have plenty of both ... help yourself," Millie responds as she takes John around the house to show him where the water tank is located. Nicholas secretly watches the interaction between Millie and John and he sees Millie pick four oranges and put them in the pockets of John\'s blazer. After John returns to his boat, though, he takes the oranges out of his pockets and throws them into the water. The next morning, Millie walks down to the shore carrying a fishing pole. Nicholas intercepts her and demands that she give him a kiss. Millie screams and attempts to run, but Nicholas grabs her and threatens to put her in the swamp if she doesn\'t kiss him. Millie still refuses, so Nicholas carries her into the swamp and puts her atop a cypress root sticking out of the water. Nicholas moves to the edge of the swamp and laughingly taunts Millie as a couple of alligators menacingly rise from the water. Terrified, Millie agrees to give Nicholas a kiss if he carries her back to the edge of the swamp. Nicholas takes a large stick and smacks the alligators, then picks up Millie and, after placing her back on solid ground, turns his head and points to the side of his face. Millie gives him a quick peck on the cheek. Later that day, Paul rows to shore with a cask to fill with fresh water. Litchfield is out on his porch and, when he notices Paul approaching, he hurries into his house and hides. After knocking on the front door several times, Paul takes the cask around the house and fills it with water from the tank. Paul starts to carry the full cask back to the rowboat, but Nicholas runs up to Paul, knocks the cask out of his hands and stomps it with his feet. When Paul tells John what happened, John rows to the shore and confronts Nicholas, telling him to leave his property alone. Nicholas replies that John should leave Millie alone. When John gets back to the rowboat, he notices that Millie is fishing nearby. He hesitates, then goes over to help her reel in what appears to be a sizable catch. The fish frees itself from the hook, though, causing the pole to flip upward and sending Millie back against John\'s chest. The next day, when John and Paul are on the Yankee\'s deck, Millie comes to the shore and asks to be invited to come aboard. Paul rows out to get her and, once on board, she surveys the tidy kitchen and living quarters and remarks, "It couldn\'t be neater if you were two nice old ladies." Paul notes that there\'s a good wind for sailing, and at Millie\'s urging, John agrees to take her on a brief voyage. Millie begins the trip with enthusiasm, standing on the bow and exclaiming "Free at last â free!" In a short while, though, her mood transforms into one of apprehension and she runs below deck, seemingly terrified. John follows her and asks, "Why are you so afraid of things?" "Heredity," Millie replies, "a curse that descended from my grandfather to my father, and to me." Millie says she envies John\'s freedom, but he corrects her: "The only thing I valued in life was taken from me in an instant. It gave me a freedom I did not want and left me a lonely, aimless wanderer." When John takes Millie back to shore on the rowboat, they are greeted by Nicholas who is carrying a concealed knife. Nicholas lunges at John with the knife, but John knocks Nicholas to the ground and knocks the knife away. An angry Nicholas pulls the branch off a tree and slaps it against the tree trunk before collapsing in a sitting position and crying. That night on the boat, Millie dominates John\'s thoughts. Still fearful of becoming attached to someone, John wakes Paul and instructs him to get the ship under way immediately. Nicholas confronts Millie and asks her to marry him. Aghast, Millie tells Nicholas he\'ll have to leave. "Don\'t say that, Millie. Please don\'t get me started," Nicholas replies. Millie runs to her room and blocks the door by putting a chair underneath the doorknob. John has a change of heart and steers the Yankee back into the inlet. He tells Millie, "I had to come back â I couldn\'t go away without you." Millie warns that Nicholas would kill both of them and shows John a wanted poster seeking Nicholas on a murder charge and containing the warning, "He is a homicidal maniac." "He said if I ran away he\'d kill grandfather," Millie said. John tells Millie to bring Litchfield to the wharf at eight o\'clock that night. That evening Millie takes her grandfather into the drawing room, shuts the door and begins making preparations to leave. As she helps him with his coat, his face freezes into an expression of fear as he stares at something behind her. Millie turns around and is shocked to see Nicholas has partially opened the door and is watching them. At the wharf, Paul and John light a match to check a pocket watch and note that it\'s going on nine o\'clock. John tells Paul that if anything happens to him, Paul gets his boat and some cash while Millie will get the balance of his assets. John then heads up to the house, carrying a gun. John first enters the drawing room and finds Litchfield\'s body on the floor. He hears Nicholas pacing upstairs . Nicholas is in Millie\'s room and has tied Millie on her bed and put a gag over her mouth. John quietly makes his way upstairs and stealthily makes his way down the second-floor hallway. He catches his foot in a hole in the floor, dropping his gun, and the commotion brings Nicholas out of Millie\'s room. The two men begin to fight on the stairwell. Nicholas brandishes a knife, but John bites his hand, forcing him to drop it. The men tumble down to the first floor and John pushes Nicholas against a table, overturning a lamp and starting a fire in the drawing room. Millie has managed to free herself after a long struggle. She and John head to the wharf with Nicholas close on their heels. Nicholas and Paul get into a struggle, but Paul manages to push Nicholas away and join John and Millie in the rowboat. A frustrated Nicholas heads back inside the burning house and finds the gun John dropped. Nicholas heads back down to the wharf with the gun. John wants to set sail, but Paul warns that it\'s low tide and the boat would just barely clear the bar. John tells Paul to go up on deck and raise the sails anyway. Nicholas begins shooting at the boat, wounding Paul. John finishes raising the sails and an injured Paul attempts to steer the boat. Back on shore, a vicious dog that Litchfield had kept chained up breaks free, runs down to the wharf and savagely mauls Nicholas. Paul tells Millie to take the ship\'s wheel just before he loses consciousness. John takes a pole and begins calling out water depths until the boat clears the bar.'] ["Alonzo the Armless is a circus freak who uses his feet to toss knives and fire a rifle at his partner, Nanon.

However, the events of the film are arranged to simulate the passage of a single day .Silents Are Golden entry Shots and scenes are cut together based on relationships of image, motion, point of view, and thematic content. At times, a sort of non-narrative commentary can be implied, as in edits that juxtapose workers entering a factory with cattle being beaten and driven into a corral. The five reel film is divided into five acts, and each act is announced through a title card at the beginning and end. One leitmotiv that is present in all of the acts, which largely connects them, is the theme of the train and streetcar. Much of the motion in the film, and many of the scene transitions, are built around the motion of trains and streetcars. I Akt: The first act starts the day, beginning with calm waters and a graphic representation of a sunrise. Railroad crossing gates are lowered, a train travels through down the tracks and proceeds into the city, ending with a graphic of the "Berlin" sign approaching. The film then transitions through calm and empty streets, to the gradual process of the city waking up. At first, only objects are seen, such as a bit of paper blowing through an empty street, but soon a few people arise, then more are about, and the activity builds to crowds of workers going to work, pedestrians, busy streetcars, trains etc. A hand manipulates a lever, effectively turning on the city, and factory machinery springs to life. Glass bulbs are produced, sheets of metal are cut, molten steel is poured, smokestacks are seen against the sky, and the first act ends. II Akt: The second act shows more of the general life of the city, beginning with the opening of gates, shutters, windows, doors, people busy cleaning, fruit carts, children going to school. Mailmen start their day, shops open. Different classes of people are seen, some mounting buses and streetcars, while wealthy men enter chauffeured private cars. The city is bustling with activity. Office workers prepare to start their day, as roll top desks open, people set out their pens, paper, open books, remove the cases from typewriters, and a bank of typists quickly erupt into activity. Keys on keyboards spiral around one another, and a montage of a spinning hypnotist\'s wheel, monkeys biting one another, telephone operators, machinery, and dogs fighting is mixed into the general busy work of the office, building quickly to a crescendo... phone receivers hang up. End of the second act. III Akt: The third act shows more busy street life, and a variety of people of different classes going about their business. There are industrial workers, construction workers, salespeople, shoppers, etc. A fight between two men breaks out briefly, but is quickly stopped by bystanders and a policeman. There are many crowds, a father and bride arriving at a wedding, some flirtation between people on the street, a coffin on a hearse seen through the windows of a streetcar, a diplomat arrives at a ministry, the Reich President is saluted by police, a conservative students\' organization is marching with banners, an angry protestor lectures a crowd, there are a few glimpses of racial minorities, lots of workers, and plenty of chaotic activity. Trains, trains, trains, and several newspapers held up for display, dissolving over one another, bringing us to the end of the third act. IV Akt: The fourth act starts with a lunch break. 12:00 is shown on a clock, and the spinning wheels of a factory slow to a stop. A variety of workers leave their workplaces. People start to eat and drink, and animals feed. Some poignant transitions intercut a wealthy diner with a lion feeding on meat from a bone, and hungry street kids embracing their mother clothed in rags sitting out on the steps. Many types of people eat, and some rest. Some poor folk sleep on benches or wall ledges, while activity goes on around them. Animals are seen resting, as an elephant lays down, a work dog tethered to a cart lies on the pavement, various zoo animals loll about. Idle kids play. Finally, a demanding diner in a cafe taps his spoon on a sugar bowl, and it awakens the city again, as the animals rise, then factory machinery starts up, and workers return to work. A paper press churns out newspapers, and a man reads a paper which is held up for our view... words leap up prominently from the page, first "Krise" , then "Mord" , BÃ¶rse , "Heirat" , and then six times "Geld... Geld...Geld" . A storm of sorts arises, with the montage of revolving doors, wind, roller coasters and trains, rain, cyclones of leaves, a woman peering frantically over a rail into water, cut against P.O.V.s of roller coasters, churning water, a crowd looking down, a splash, eyes, fighting dogs, etc. The chaos eventually subsides, and the day winds down, as workers finish their day, and recreation begins. Children play in a lake, boats come out to race, and many kinds of races and games are displayed, finally concluding with a few romantic couples on park benches and the fall of night. V Akt: The fifth and final act is devoted to the people\'s entertainment at night. House lights come on, then many advertising signs are lit, and people go out to the theater. Curtains open on a variety of performances, including showgirl burlesques, trapeze artists, jugglers, singers and dancers. Audiences gather in a movie theater, and a brief glimpse is seen of Chaplin\'s distinctive feet and cane at the bottom of a movie screen. As people leave a theater show, some sexuality is implied by a man\'s hand caressing a woman\'s bare arm as they enter a taxi, and her bare calf and frilly skirt are displayed. They pull away, ignoring a child beggar, and a lit up hotel sign is next displayed. Another montage of entertainments includes ice shows and hockey, skiers, sledders, indoor races, boxing and dance contests. The leitmotiv of streetcars continues, and rail workers continue to work through the night. People drink, flirt, and dance in beer halls and cocktail lounges, while card games and roulette are played. The city starts to spin wildly, transitions into a firework display, and thus ends the final act and the film.'] ['A man tries to go to sleep, but is disturbed by a giant bug.

When he comes to the picture of an aged Sergius Alexander , he pauses, then tells his assistant  to cast the man. Sergius shows up at the Eureka Studio with a horde of other extras and is issued a general\'s uniform. As he is dressing, another actor complains that his continual head twitching is distracting. Sergius apologizes and explains that it is the result of a great shock he once experienced. The film then flashes back ten years to Czarist Russia, which is in the midst of the Communist Revolution. Grand Duke Sergius Alexander, the Czar\'s cousin and commander of all his armies, is informed by his adjutant that two actors entertaining the troops have been identified as dangerous "revolutionists" during a routine passport check. He decides to toy with them for his amusement. When one of them, Leo Andreyev, becomes insolent, Sergius whips him across the face and has him jailed. Leo\'s companion, the beautiful Natalie Dabrova , is an entirely different matter. She intrigues Sergius. Despite the danger she poses, he takes her along with him. After a week, he gives her a pearl necklace as a token of his feelings for her. She comes to realize that he is at heart a man of great honor who loves Russia as deeply as she does. When she invites him to her room, he spots a partially hidden pistol, but deliberately turns his back to her. She draws the weapon, but cannot fire. Despite their political differences, she has fallen in love with him. When the Bolsheviks capture the train on which they are traveling, she pretends to despise him. Instead of having him shot out of hand like his officers, she suggests they have him stoke coal into the locomotive all the way to Petrograd, where he will be publicly hanged. When everyone is drunk, however, she helps him escape, giving him back the pearl necklace to finance his way out of the country. Sergius jumps from the train, then watches in horror as it tumbles off a nearby bridge into the icy river below, taking Natalie with it. Ten years later, Sergius is reduced to poverty, eking out a living as a Hollywood extra. When he and the director finally meet, Sergius recognizes him. Leo, in an ironic act calculated to humiliate him, casts him as a Russian general in a battle scene. He is directed to give a speech to a group of actors playing his dispirited men. When one soldier tries to incite a mutiny, telling the general that "you\'ve given your last command", he whips the man in the face as instructed, just as he had once struck Leo.

Overstraining himself, he dies, inquiring with his last words if they have won. Moved, Leo tells him they have. The assistant remarks, "That guy was a great actor." Leo replies, "He was more than a great actor - he was a great man."'] ["Susie Louise Fazenda turns down Lee's  offer of love to become an actress.

The naive American, Mr. West, played by Porfori Podobed as a Harold Lloyd type , is a YMCA president who is planning a trip to the newly-founded Soviet Union to spread the idea of the YMCA. His wife, Madge, is worried that Russia is full of savage Bolsheviks who wear primitive rags and fur for clothing, as depicted in American magazines. He takes along his cowboy friend Jeddie played by Boris Barnet for protection and as a companion. However, on arriving in the USSR his briefcase is stolen, he gets separated from Jeddie and he falls into the hands of a group of thieves, including a run-down Countess , who masquerade as counter-revolutionaries. The thieves play on West\'s fears and engineer his abduction by crooks dressed up as caricature Bolshevik "barbarians." The thieves then "rescue" West from the clutches of these fictional Bolsheviks, extorting thousands of dollars from him along the way. In the end, it is the real Bolshevik police who rescue West, rather than his friend Jeddie . West then takes a sightseeing tour of Moscow, where he sees that the Soviet government did not destroy all cultural landmarks, such as Moscow University and the Bolshoi Theater, as the thieves suggested. The film culminates in Mr.West watching a military parade with the policeman and concluding that the American view of the Soviet Union is wrong.

A middle-aged man  sharpens his razor at his balcony door and tests the razor on his thumb. He then opens the door, and idly fingers the razor while gazing at the moon, about to be engulfed by a thin cloud, from his balcony. There is a cut to a close-up of a young woman  being held by the man as she calmly stares straight ahead. Another cut occurs to the moon being overcome by the cloud as the man slits the woman\'s eye with the razor, and the vitreous humour spills out from it. The subsequent title card reads "eight years later". A slim young man  bicycles down a calm urban street wearing what appears to be a nun\'s habit and a striped box with a strap around his neck. A cut occurs to the young woman from the first scene, who has been reading in a sparingly furnished upstairs apartment. She hears the young man approaching on his bicycle and casts aside the book she was reading . She goes to the window and sees the young man lying on the curb, his bicycle on the ground. She emerges from the building and attempts to revive the young man. Later, the young woman assembles pieces of the young man\'s clothing on a bed in the upstairs room, and concentrates upon the clothing. The young man appears near the door. The young man and the young woman stare at his hand, which has a hole in the palm from which ants emerge. A slow transition occurs focusing on the armpit hair of the young woman as she lies on the beach and a sea urchin at a sandy location. There is a cut to an androgynous young woman in the street below the apartment, poking at a severed hand with a cane while surrounded by a large crowd and a policeman. The crowd clears when the policeman places the hand in the box previously carried by the young man and gives it to the young woman. The androgynous young woman contemplates something happily while standing in the middle of the now busy street clutching the box. She is then run over by a car and a few bystanders gather around her. The young man and the young woman watch these events unfold from the apartment window. The young man seems to take sadistic pleasure in the androgynous young woman\'s danger and subsequent death, and as he gestures at the shocked young woman in the room with him, he leers at her and grasps her bosom. The young woman resists him at first, but then allows him to touch her as he imagines her nude from the front and the rear. The young woman pushes him away as he drifts off and she attempts to escape by running to the other side of the room. The young man corners her as she reaches for a racquet in self-defense, but he suddenly picks up two ropes and drags two grand pianos containing dead and rotting donkeys, stone tablets containing the Ten Commandments, and two rather bewildered priests  who are attached by ropes. As he is unable to move, the young woman escapes the room. The young man chases after her, but she traps his hand, which is infested with ants, in the door. She finds the young man in the next room, dressed in his nun\'s garb in the bed.  The subsequent title card reads "around three in the morning". The young man is roused from his rest by the sound of a door-buzzer ringing . The young woman goes to answer the door and does not return. Another young man dressed in lighter clothing  arrives in the apartment, gesturing angrily at him. The second young man forces the first one to throw away his nun\'s clothing and then makes him stand against a wall. The subsequent title card reads "Sixteen years ago." We see the second young man from the front for the first time as he admires the art supplies and books on the table near the wall and forces the first young man to hold two of the books as he stares at the wall. The first young man eventually shoots the second young man when the books abruptly turn into pistols. The second young man, now in a meadow, dies while swiping at a nude figure which suddenly disappears into thin air. A group of men come and carry his corpse away. The young woman returns to the apartment and sees a death head moth. The first young man sneers at her as she retreats and wipes his mouth off his face with his hand. The young woman very nervously applies some lipstick in response. Subsequently the first young man makes the young woman\'s armpit hair attach itself to where his mouth would be on his face through gestures. The young woman looks at the first young man with disgust, and leaves the apartment sticking her tongue out at him. As she exits her apartment, the street is replaced by a coastal beach, where the young woman meets a third man with whom she walks arm in arm. He shows her the time on his watch and they walk near the rocks, where they find the remnants of the first young man\'s nun\'s clothing and the box. They seem to walk away clutching each other happily and make romantic gestures in a long tracking shot. However, the film abruptly cuts to the final shot with a title card reading "In Spring," showing the couple buried in sand up to their elbows.'] ['In the Expressionistic frame story, in which human lives are each represented by a candle, Death grants a woman three chances to save her lover, if love can triumph over death.
