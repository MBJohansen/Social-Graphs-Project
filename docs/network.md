
## Network
A network was build to examine whether certain actors dominate certain genres, in the sense that some actors may appear in many different movies from the same genre.

The network consists of movies as nodes and actors as edges. If an actor stars in two different movies, these movies are connected with an edge. Nodes and edges also contains different attributes. A movie node contains the name of the movie and the genre of the movie whereas the edges only contains the actor name which connects two nodes.
