  <img src="images/wordclouds/NewActionWC.jpg" class="wordcloud_right" width="50%"/>

  The action genre for old and new movies are quite similar but there are some words which have been replaced. For example the word "kill" which is very often present in older movie plots where it is almost completely gone for new movie plots. Instead words such as "life", "world", and "man" occur more often.

  <img src="images/wordclouds/OldAdventureWC.jpg" class="wordcloud_left" width="50%"/>
  <img src="images/wordclouds/NewAdventureWC.jpg" class="wordcloud_right" width="50%"/>

  For older adventure movies words like "escape", "return", "back", "find", and "take" occur more often than in newer adventure movies where again "world" and "life" are more often used. The word "one" is seen for both old and new which could mean that they both revolve around a single protagonist who needs to escape or find something or about their life in general.

  <img src="images/wordclouds/OldAnimationWC.jpg" class="wordcloud_left" width="50%"/>
  <img src="images/wordclouds/NewAnimationWC.jpg" class="wordcloud_right" width="50%"/>

  For old animation movies certain names such as Daffy, Tom and Jerry are often used in plot descriptions which could mean that cartoons with these characters dominate the genre. Again words like "life" and "world" are often used in the newer plot descriptions, but also "new" and "friend" are much more present for newer movies. In both old and new movies the words "one" and "find" are present.

  <summary>Biography</summary>

  <img src="images/wordclouds/OldBiographyWC.jpg" class="wordcloud_left" width="50%"/>
  <img src="images/wordclouds/NewBiographyWC.jpg" class="wordcloud_right" width="50%"/>

  In the biography genre the words "one" and "life" occur often for both old and new movies, which makes sense since biographies often revolve around a certain person who has accomplished something remarkable in their life. Notably the word "documentary" are present in the word cloud for new movies which is a clear sign of genres being mixed since many movies include several genres. Furthermore the word "film" occurs often in the plot descriptions. This could be due to the type of genre since a biography is often based on facts and the word "film" is seen often also seen in plot descriptions for the genres; Documentary, History, and News.

  <img src="images/wordclouds/NewComedyWC.jpg" class="wordcloud_right" width="50%"/>

  Again the words "one" and "find" are often present for both old and new movies. Also the words "new", "friend", and "life" are present in both where the latter two are more present in new movies. Furthermore the word "love" is often used in plot descriptions for new movies and could again be a sign of genre mixing since there are probably many movies in the romantic comedy genre.

  <img src="images/wordclouds/OldCrimeWC.jpg" class="wordcloud_left" width="50%"/>
  <img src="images/wordclouds/NewCrimeWC.jpg" class="wordcloud_right" width="50%"/>

  The word cloud for old crime movies are very different from the word clouds seen previously since there are many names of persons and/or places where as the word cloud for new crime movies include words such as "life", "one", "find", and "new", which is also seen in several other word clouds, especially for new movies.

  As seen on the word clouds above old and new western movies are very similar and very clear what entities are often in western movies, such as a town, some outlaws, a sheriff, and a man or men who are fighting the outlaws to protect the town and their family.
