The analysis of the datasets are divided into different sections.
The plot summaries are analyzed with word clouds and afterwards a sentiment analysis is carried out on the plot summaries.
The movie titles and actor/actress names are used to create a network which is analyzed after the plot summaries.
The following pages will go through each of these steps starting with the word clouds, then the sentiment, and finally the network of movies and actors/actresses.
