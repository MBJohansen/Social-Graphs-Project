
## Introduction

This project aims to explore the differences between newer and older movies within specific genres. The idea stems from the seemingly increasing number of remakes and very similar movies being released. To accurately compare movies, the analysis can be split into three main categories namely word frequency analysis, sentiment analysis, and actor collaboration graph analysis. These three areas will be discussed more in detail in the next sections.

Word frequency analysis will be conducted with the use of word clouds within each genre of movies. Once again, newer and older movies will be compared to see if the words used to describe movies will have changed over the years. This may reveal some growing trends within the different genres while also giving an insight into how plots within each genre are typically described.

Sentiment analysis will give an insight into the overall tone of the movies. This has been conducted on short summaries of movies, and will be compared within different genres to get the most telling results. The aim is to deduct whether movies of the same genres have become more negative or positive overall based on the summaries of the plots.

Lastly, the analysis of the actor network will also be conducted. This will show the dominance of certain actors within genres and may give another angle into why movies seem so similar. If the same actors are seen again and again within a given genre, the movies within it may seem more similar to the viewers.

Once the analysis has been conducted, the findings will be discussed and reflected upon.
